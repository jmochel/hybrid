                        <member> What groups have the most political power?</member>
                        <member>What is the basic style of government: feudal, aristocratic, oligarchy,
                        absolute ruler, democracy, what? In terms of political systems themselves -
                        there is a vast spectrum of possibilities -Anarchic, Aristocratic,
                        Autarchic, Authoritarian, Autocratic, Bureaucratic, Capitalist,
                        Collectivist, Colonialist, Commercialism, Communist, Confederates,
                        Constitutional, Constitutional monarchy, Democracy, Despotism, Direct
                        Democratic, Dynastic, Ecclesiastical, Ethnocentric, Expansionist, Fascist,
                        Federalist, Fundamentalist, Gerontocratic, Imperialist, Internationalist,
                        Interventionist, Isolationist, Matriarchy, Meritocracy, Monarchy, Orthodox,
                        Parochialism, Paternalist, Patriarchy, Pluralist, Plutocracy, Police State,
                        Protectionist, Regionalist, Republican, Separatist, Socialist, Theocratic,
                        Totalitarian, Utilitarian, Utopian. Each system experiences different forms
                        of intrigue. Feudalism and other aristocratic forms of governance tend to be
                        subsumed by court intrigues revolving around legacies, dynasties,
                        succession, etc. Republics, on the other hand, obsess over questions of law,
                        rights and public resources. Finally, just as in the real world, a nation
                        might call itself one thing, yet behave quite the opposite. Humans might be
                        treated quite well, but minorities of other races (or the same race), might
                        be subject to entirely different laws, slavery, forced exile, etc. </member>

            <title>Merovan Culture</title>
            <subtitle>Camelot with a dark twist</subtitle>
            <para>Merova lies on the northeastern edge of the continent. Merovans are built like the
                Norman French with many brunettes and ash blondes. Merova is the King Arthur’s court of
                the world. Merova looks like the traditional fantasy version of feudal society composed
                of Knights, Nobles and Ladies. Is a single kingdom with 36 strong dukes newly united
                under one king. It has high wizards and sorcerers as well as priests and priestesses. If
                you want to play a traditional men at arms or a knight, this is the culture to be from.
                Women’s roles are more limited, with only priestesses easily being able to travel and
                adventure. Typical Merovan characters would be Knights or men at arms. Priests or
                priestesses. Thieves. Wizards and sorcerers of various types. </para>
            <para>Norman Knights and men at Arms (Chain, Plate and Leather, Long Swords and Bastard Swords,
                    Spears and Pole Arms, Xbows rather then Self Bows) French speaking. with a large native
                    born population slowly melding in. </para>
            <para>Ducal fiefdoms with bordering Marchers. The Arch Dukes have the population and the
                wealth while the Marches have the arms and the pride. Their only real common ground is
                the king. The king is from a small neglected branch of one of the Ducal families (Almost
                Native is the phrase....). Hairochan advised and trained and guarded. Unerneath it all
                is the Native Born.</para>
