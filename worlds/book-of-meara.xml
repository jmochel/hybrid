        <title>Physical Environment</title>
        <para>The physical environment (climate, landscape, resources) 
            shapes cultural practices, such as food, clothing, and housing.</para>
        <section xml:id="merova-culture-physical-environment-geography">
            <title>Geography</title>
            <para>The geography is filled with rugged hills and valleys.
                It is bounded on the western boundary by a sheer mountain range with a few passes through to the vallys to the west.
                There are morraines, high ridges formed from glacial debris especially in the northernn areas of Merova. The southern islands expecially
                are composed of that kind of morraines. Many of those morraines have ridges cut out by meltwater streams often 
                framed by large boulders at the base.  There is a significant number of valleys filled with rivers, lakes and ponds.  
            </para>
            <para>
            Glacial till (a mix of sand, clay, gravel, and rocks) left behind poor, rocky soil in much of the region, though river valleys often have fertile floodplains.
            </para>
            <para>The southern and eastern border are edged in rocky coastline with peninsulas, islands, and estuaries.
                As glaciers melted, sea levels rose, flooding coastal areas and creating features like bays and islands.
                There are two large bays in the region,  Meara Harbor, and Badger Bay (Narragensat).
                Merova is easily accessed via small boats throughout the coast.</para>
            <para>There are a set of east to west and north to south roads of solid construction. The largest is the <emphasis>King's Road</emphasis>
                which is a 16m wide road that runs from Meara Harbor in the east to the Great Doors in the westward pass. 
                The roads are built with layered construction. The <emphasis>King's Road</emphasis> has 1-2m high walls on each edge. Periodically there 
                is a <emphasis>Trivium</emphasis>, a widened plaza with some combination of stone benches, walled stalls, and fountains. Often the 
                road rises up on elevated structures consisting of a series of arches, spans, or piers designed to carry a road over a valley, lowland, 
                or other obstacles like rivers and wetlands. 
            </para>
            <para>
                The roads are built with a slight arch or camber to allow water to run off into ditches on either side, preventing flooding and erosion.
                Deep side ditches collect and direct rainwater away from the road with culverts and drainage pipes were built under the road when needed.
            </para>
            <para>The roads enable a very high rate of individual and cargo travel.</para>

        <section xml:id="merova-culture-physical-environment-climate">
            <title>Climate</title>
            <para>The climate is characterized by four distinct seasons, 
                including cold winters, warm summers, and moderate precipitation 
                throughout the year. The region’s climate is influenced by its 
                latitude, proximity to the Ocean, and varying topography.
            </para>
            <formalpara>
                <title>Winter</title>
                <para>
                    Winters are cold and dry inland but moderated along the coast by the Ocean.
                    Averages range from 10°F to 30°F (-12°C to -1°C) in the 
                    north and 20°F to 40°F (-6°C to 4°C) in southern coastal areas.
                    Subzero temperatures are common in the northern regions, especially at night.
                    Heavy snowfalls are typical, with annual snow accumulations of 60–100 inches (1.5–2.5 meters) in the northern and mountainous areas.
                    Coastal areas receive less snow but can experience intense nor’easters (winter storms bringing snow, wind, and coastal flooding).

            <formalpara>
                <title>Spring</title>
                <para>Gradual warming, with highs ranging from 40°F (4°C) in March to 70°F (21°C) in May. Rainfall increases, and melting snow can lead to flooding in some areas.
                    Spring is often unpredictable, with a mix of snow, rain, and warm, sunny days. Budding trees and blooming flowers mark the season.

            <formalpara>
                <title>Summer</title>
                <para> (June to August). Daytime highs average 75°F to 85°F (24°C to 29°C) across the region, with 
                    cooler temperatures in the mountains and along the coast.
                    Heatwaves can push temperatures above 90°F (32°C), especially inland.
                    Summers are humid, especially in southern Merova.
                    Frequent thunderstorms, particularly in the late afternoon and evening.
                    Summers are warm and humid, with plenty of sunny days for outdoor activities.</para>

            <formalpara>
                <title>Autumn</title>
                <para>(September to November).
                    Crisp, cool weather with clear skies makes autumn one of the most popular seasons in Merova
                    Cooling from 70°F (21°C) in September to 40°F (4°C) by November.
                Has vibrant fall foliage, with trees displaying brilliant shades of red, orange, and yellow.

                Bays and harbors, like Meara Harbor, supported shipbuilding and commercial activity.
                Merova's waters, particularly the Grand Banks, are rich in cod, which are a cornerstone of the economy.
                Lobsters, clams, and oysters are also significant food and trade sources.

                    Produces edible nuts enclosed in a green husk. Eaten by colonists and used as a food source,
                    though extracting the meat from the tough shells was labor-intensive. Highly prized for its rich, dark color, black walnut wood was used for furniture, cabinetry, and gunstocks.

                    Nuts: Butternut nuts were sweeter and easier to process than black walnuts, making them a popular food source.
                    Dye: The husks were used to create a yellowish-brown dye.
