Great History

Fragments of History and Ethos:

In the beginning there was the Ur. They ruled, they hunted, and were solitary. 
They knew only the rule of power. Cooperation did not exist for them. They ruled 
by sword. Their magic was of the most savage and basic but powerful. They rode 
the dragons. 

The lesser races where theirs to play with. The Duwan, The Kurrock and the 
Aldama all paid them heed and prayer.

Then came, from another world, Then came the as the "Tor'' and their noble 
leaders the "Lordim-Tor'' (Centered around the western US?) Utah ? Golden haired 
and red eyed, wielding power as strong as the Ur. They brought with them their 
own human servants. Their humans did not thrive in this new land so the 
Lordimtor bred them to the Tor. The end result was the forerunners to the 
Torgans.

Long were the centuries that the Tor and the Ur contested. Each created races to 
battle for them. The cooperation of the Tor eventually rendered the Ur 
irrelevant. The Ur retired from the field of battle and disappeared.


The Duwan and the Kurrok came to one part of the continent and the elves to another. These races were pursued by a race called the Mergoth. The Lord and the Lady battled with the Mergoth and closed the gates to this world. In doing so they weakened themselves so that they must sleep for hundreds of years.

At some point arose the Rupa Kechil, unknown to the rest.Also, a hint of legend would be nice here.

Many humans were abandoned in the battles ? between the LordimTor and the Mergoth. The humans escaped to the east and south. What was left of the battles grounds are the blasted lands of Utah, Arizona, etc... "battle grounds"?  (Hey, you said I could mock...)

Next came the Human races from over the oceans. Human races?  Or humans?  (Yeah, minor point of implication, I know.  THat's what you get for recruiting a word geek.)

-3000 yrs Ships with Strange red haired bodies wash ashore near Maine (Here is where your timeline shows its lack of focus.  Is it notes for you?  Then you get to say what this clue means.  Is it for players?  Then the lack of context only works if they haven't found out who the 'red-haired bodies' are in the last 300 years.  Also, 'red-haired bodies' sounds like they were hirsute.  "Bodies of people with red hair" takes the focus away from whatever body hair they might have, and brings the focus back to the color of the hair in question.   Yeah, word geek again.)
