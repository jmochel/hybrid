The Bloodlines Thousands of years ago, seven of the Nine Bright Shiners 
sacrificed their powers to create the Charter: a combination of powerful objects 
(the Great Stones and the Wall) and three magic blood lines, known as the 
Abhorsen, the Clayr and the Royal Family. Five of the Seven completely lost 
themselves (one in each object or blood line) while two remained somewhat 
independent. One invested his/her power in the Royal bloodline, one in the 
Abhorsen's and one in the Clayr's (which is why the Clayr greet Sabriel as 
"cousin"). The remaining two, known as the "Wallmakers" invested themselves in 
several objects of power, including the Stones and Wall, then disappeared. These 
artifacts, the Charter Stones, are sources of the web of Charter magic that 
maintains peace and order over the kingdom. The Bloodlines all have a higher 
concentration of strong Charter mages than the general populace.
