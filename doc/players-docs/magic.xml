        <title>Overview</title>
        <subtitle>Section1 What it looks like</subtitle>
        <para>We start with the existence of mana, also called power. Spell casters use their own
            internal energies to manipulate Mana. It is not known where Mana comes from.</para>
        <para>The caster uses their own energy to raise, focus, and apply mana.  The combined acts
            of raising, focusing and applying energy is called spell casting. And it goes from the
            very unstructured up to the very structured. In many respects it is like composing
            communications out of words. If it is a very short simple sentence like "Go away" such
            as bringing forth a simple flame, It is called a cantrip.  If it is a more complete
            communication with a solid basic structure  such as "Gather up all the elemental fire in
            the immediate area and transfer it over to there" Those are called sorceries. When it is
            more complicated and requires more than the words to get the point across (Almost like a
            business presentation), then we are talking Wizardries.</para>
        <para>Only certain types of mana can be manipulated by spell casters. Each type has a
        characteristic set of properties and certain ways it interacts with other types of mana. </para>
