            them start with a mental picture of the character or the characters history. That
            picture can vary from very vague to very specific and detailed. </para>

                    actual money or material goods those points of wealth by you is dependent upon
                    the culture you're coming from. In some cultures the characters may not be able
                    to get a lot of free cash they may have easy access to Well-crafted goods. You
                    can add to your wealth points as a result of your career (TBD XREF) or by

                    on the culture but it may also be dependent on the community chosen. For example
                    a character may choose to buy a higher reputation among mages rather than having
                    a general reputation. You can add to your Community points as a result of your

            <para>There are often modifiers for the primary statistics (As well as the other
                statistics) for a given race. Some races have gifts or abilities as well as other
                trade-offs. For the most part the human races have no modifiers to their statistics.
                Once you've picked a race just ask your friendly neighborhood games master for the
                description of the race and the racial modifiers. (TBD XREF) Any of the racial
                modifiers for primary statistics are applied immediately, any racial modifiers for
                secondary statistics are applied after those secondary statistics have been
                calculated. </para>

            <title>Selecting a culture.</title>
            <para> Once you have decided on the race, picking the culture is the next logical step.
                Each culture comes with a standard set of skills that can be bought as a bundle. For
                example thw character knowns the native language of the culture as well as the
                common history and lore of the culture. The character knows how to behave
                appropriate to their social class in the culture. Each culture has standard sets of
                these templates. These templates are detailed in the cultural description. In
                addition, each culture may have special gifts, particular advantages or
                disadvantages as well as particular additions to the Skill, Wealth, and Community
                pools.</para>

            <para> These are all terms for the various quirks of genetics and experience that give
                the characters a distinct flavor to match the history of the character. For example
                a character may have a gift that allows them to use magic or a disadvantage such as
                they are albino. Each trade-off that gives or costs a certain number of points from
                each of the pools. For example, a character that is Albino gets 15 additional points
                that they can apply to the Wealth, Community, or Skill pools In exchange for the
                disadvantage while playing of being sensitive to light. </para>

            <title>Cultural Modifiers</title>
            <para> The player should determine the culture and the home environment the character is
                raised in. Both of these will have a major effect on the numbers and types of skills
                that a player character starts out with. Some cultural templates may have a cost
                that must be paid from the Personal Development pool. As a result of growing up in a
                given environment the character gains skill in how to maneuver in that environment.
                i.e. A character born and raised in an zero-gravity environment will have high
                skills in {\em Movement:0-g } and little or no skills in {\em Movement:1-g }. The
                character will start out with a knowledge of how to use the technology common to
                their culture and what the social dos and and donts are. These types of skills are
                listed in the table below.along with some specific examples. \begin{enumerate} \item

            <title>Careers</title>
            <para> The next step is determining the career path the character took up until the
                start of play. This is where a majority of a character's skills and history will be
                developed. The process is fairly simple: the player selects the career they wish to
                enter and then they roll for the character to gain skills, wealth, and status during
                each year they are in that career. This means three rolls. One for Personal
                Development, one for Wealth, and one for status. These three pools : Personal
                Development, Wealth, and Status are the basis of the final resolution of the
                character's skills, history, and station. Each of the available paths has its own
                advantages and disadvantages. Educational careers give one little chance to injure
                one's self but the possible monetary gains are low. Military careers are dangerous,
                but the skills gained there may not be available elsewhere. The three pools each
                have a different basic function. The Personal Development pool serves as the point
                pool for increasing a PC statistics, skills, or creating special abilities. The
                Wealth pool contains points to be spent in establishing the character's basic
                financial state. The Status pool contains points to be spent in gaining all the
                possible trappings of status: reputation, syncophants, or other recognition. Players
                do have a limited amount of lateral movement for these points. Each career is
                delineated by a simple set of numbers combined with a simple description. It has the
                following format: </para>

		The DF for a MAW or PAW roll to determine the number of personal points

        usually involves the loss of points from the personal pool.

        roll to determine whether or not the character gained in the material 
        or financial area. A successful roll adds Base Financial Gain 
		to the Wealth Pool. This represents the character's gain in free

        roll to determine whether or not the character gained in  
        Status. A succesful roll adds 1 to the Status Pool.
		Status is a rather subjective thing but typically, a 
        military career leads to increases in rank and possible minor fame. A 
        increase in status in a shadowy career would lead to the development 
        of a "Rep".  Most careers will have a status table that describes 
        the cost of a specific rank or status gain.

            <para> When characters are first generated they can buy single skills using points from
                the personal pool. During character generation all skills cost 1 point per rank to
                purchase. So rank 0 costs 1 point, rank 1 costs 2 points , and so on. After
                characters have been generated they advance in their skills according to rules
                described in the Players Guide. In summary single skills cost $ 1 + Rank $ in
                personal development points. </para>

            <title>Skill Ranks</title>
            <para> The meaning of skill ranks varies somewhat based on the rarity of the skill and
                so on but, in general, the skill ranks map to expertise according to table
                ~\ref{Table:SkillRanks} on page~\pageref{Table:SkillRanks}. \include{tskill9}
                Someone is familiar with the skill if they have tried it enough that the tools and
                techniques are known even if the character has no real practice with them. A
                character is at a begginer level of skill if they have used the skills enough to be
                comfortable with all the basic techniques needed even though they may not be
                consistent in their execution. A character is at a dedicated amateur level of skill
                if they are consistent in executing all the basic skills even though they have no
                real comfort with any of the advanced techniques. A solid workaday craftsman is
                consistent and accomplished in executing all the basic skills and are familiar with
                the advanced techniques and tools. A professional is consistent and accomplished in
                te full range of basic and advanced techniques used in routine application of the
                skill. An expert is consistent and accomplished in all the basic and advanced
                techniques used in routine application of the skill as well as being familiar with
                techniques and tools needed for less common usage of the skill. An master is
                consistent and accomplished in all the techniques used in most applications of the
                skill. In addition they are familiar with some esoteric techniques needed for
                bizarre and unusual applications of a skill. An character at a mystical mastery
                level accomplished in all the techniques used in almost all known applications of
                the skill. In addition they have a whole series of special techniques and tools they
                have developed for themselves. </para>

            <title>Statistic Costs</title>
            <para> When characters are first generated they can buy statistics using points from the
                personal pool. During character generation all stats are raised using the costs from
                the table ~\ref{Table:StatCosts} on page~\pageref{Table:StatCosts}. So adding 1
                point of PST costs 4 points, adding 2 costs 8 points, and so on. After characters
                have been generated they advance in their stats according to rules described in the
                Players Guide. \input{tcgen4.tex} </para>

            <title>Skill Packages</title>
            <para> What we have discussed up till now has been single skills. Quite often the
                character will be using a skill package. A skill package is a collection of related
                skills that have a bundled at a bargain cost. A typical skill package would be :
                \begin{verbatim} Terran Law Enforcement Officer Package Lore: Terran Law Culture
                Lore: Terran LEO Weapon: Pistol Weapon: Tonfa Weapon: Taser Streetwise Interrogation
                Data Analysis Computer Ops Cost: 5 \end{verbatim} This package would cost 5 points
                to get rank 0 in all the listed skills, 10 points to get rank 1 and so on. This
                compares well to 9 points to get rank 0 in all the skills and 18 points to get rank
                1 and so on. After character generation, these skills are raised individually just
                like any other skill according to rules described in the Players Guide. </para>

            <title>Enhancements and Limitations</title>
            <para> After a character has some points in the three pools associated with character
                creation ( personal, wealth, status) they may choose to use them to buy Enhancements
                that will add flavour to the character. There are always the base enhancements
                allowed to the character. The points in the personal pool can be used to buy skills
                at the generation cost. The points in the personal pool can be used to buy stats at
                the costs listed in the stat cost tables. Enhancements are gains in either
                background or special abilities that can be paid for with points from one of the
                pools. There are two main types. There are Character Enhancements and there are
                Environmental Enhancements. Character Enhancements are natural aptitudes that are
                typically permanent and inherent to the character's makeup. Enhanced hearing or
                eidetic memory are examples of Character Enhancements. Environmental Enhancements
                are typically advantages that depend on the character to maintain them. Such as
                inherited wealth and various components of status. </para>

        <sect2>
            <title>Character Enhancements</title>
            <para> Character Enhancements have both Depth and Scope to help govern their cost. Depth
                refers to the numeric advantage given by the enhancemnet in a given area. The scope
                denotes the number of different areas that the spab may be applicable to. In the
                case of raising a character statistic the scope refers to the number of other stats
                affected. A character enhancement that involves enhancing a statistic is different
                from raising the statistic. A raised statistic ends up increasing the SB of the
                character in that stat. The enhanced stat increases the Rank of the character for
                any direct rolls against that stat. Thus an Enhanced Stat affects Saving Throws and
                Concentration Checks. </para>

                <para> Ambidexterity allows the character to use either hand when performing
                    actions. The character takes no off-hand penalties. Costs 10 Personal

                <title>Enhanced Statistics</title>
                <para> Most of the enhancements that involve heightened stats in specialised areas
                    have a simple cost equal to $ 1/2 $ the purchase cost of the stats. So someone
                    with a heightened sense of smell would pay one half the cost of Physical
                    Awareness (PAW) or $ 1/2 \times 4 = 2$ for each additional point of increase. So
                    someone with a 12 PAW could pay 8 points of ersonal Development and get a PAW
                    (for smells) of 16. </para>

                <title>PSI Gift</title>
                <para> The heightening of PSI for broad categories of PSI skills such as
                    Temporokinetics has a cost equal to $ 3/4 $ of the PSI stat or 8 points. So
                    someone with a gift for Temporokinetics would pay 8 points per point of
                    heightened PSI in that area. The heightening of PSI for specific PSI skills such
                    as Teleportation has a cost equal to $ 1/2 $ of the PSI stat or 5 points. So
                    someone with a gift for Teleportation would pay 5 points per point of heightened
                    PSI in that area. </para>

            <sect3>
                <title>Presence</title>
                <para> This enhancement reflects other people's innate awareness of the character in
                    a given area. A person with a high presence is hard to ignore. It is calculated
                    in just the same way as other enhanced stats. So Enhanced Physical Presence is 2
                    points per additional effect. Decreased Physical Presence is 2 points per
                    subtracted effect. Enhanced Mental Presence is 2 points per additional effect.
                    Decreased Mental Presence is 2 points per subtracted effect. The decreased
                    presence enhancements are, in effect, stealth enhancements. </para>

                So for determining the cost of a single ( Scope = $ 10^0$ ) friend willing to help
                you all (Depth = Very High ) the time is simply $ 1 + 20 $. The DF describes how
                willing the person is to help you. So in the example DF = 12 implies +60% to the
                chance for aid from that person. </para>
            <sect3>
                <title>Wealth</title>
                <para> The first and most commonly used is the wealth advantage. This differs from
                    the basic wealth that can be gained by spending the points from the wealth pool
                    in that the gain is approximately one third that of a pure monetary spend, but
                    the gain so obtained is income that will continue to be generated for as long as
                    the PC pays attention to the interests that generate the funds. The larger the
                    income the more work involved in maintaining it. The scale of the income is
                    derived from table ~\ref{Table:EnvironmentalEnhancementScopeCosts}. The amount
                    of freedom from managing that income is given by the table

                <para> A continued career as a Law Enforcement Officer or soldier is a balanced ad
                    and disad situation. Yes, the character has enemies, but the backing of the
                    organization offsets this. </para>
