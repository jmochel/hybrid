            picture can vary from very vague to very specific and detailed. </para>

                <para>Each character gets 10 points that they can use to pick the amount of money or
                    the amount and quality of materials that the character starts with. How much
                    actual money or material goods those points of wealth by you is dependent upon
                    the culture you're coming from. In some cultures the characters may not be able
                    to get a lot of free cash they may have easy access to Well-crafted goods. You
                    can add to your wealth points by specific Trade-offs See <xref

                <para>Each character gets 10 Community points. The Community points are used to
                    purchase status or reputation within one or more communities. The impact of the
                    status or reputation and the size of the community all factor into the cost of
                    that status or reputation. The effect of that status or reputation is dependent
                    on the culture but it may also be dependent on the community chosen. For example
                    a character may choose to buy a higher reputation among mages rather than having
                    a general reputation. You can add to your Community points as a by specific

            <para>There are often modifiers for the primary statistics (As well as the other
                statistics) for a given race. Some races have gifts or abilities as well as other
                trade-offs. For the most part the human races have no modifiers to their statistics.
                Once you've picked a race just ask your friendly neighborhood games master for the
                description of the race and the racial modifiers. <xref linkend="racial-modifiers"/>
                Any of the racial modifiers for primary statistics are applied immediately, any
                racial modifiers for secondary statistics are applied after those secondary
                statistics have been calculated. </para>

            <para> Once you have decided on the race, picking the culture is the next logical step.
                Each culture comes with a standard set of skills that can be bought as a bundle. For
                example the character knowns the native language of the culture as well as the
                common history and lore of the culture. The character knows how to behave
                appropriate to their social class in the culture. Each culture has standard sets of
                these templates. These templates are detailed in the cultural description. In
                addition, each culture may have special gifts, particular advantages or
                disadvantages as well as particular additions to the Skill, Wealth, and Community
                pools.</para>

            <para> This a term for the various quirks of genetics and experience that give the
                characters a distinct flavor to match the history of the character. For example a
                character may have a gift that allows them to use magic or a disadvantage such as
                they are albino. Each trade-off that gives or costs a certain number of points from
                each of the pools. For example, a character that is Albino gets 15 additional points
                that they can apply to the Wealth, Community, or Skill pools In exchange for the
                disadvantage while playing of being sensitive to light. </para>

                <para> The heightening of NRG for Some specialized area of spell casting such as
                    warding. Broad categories of Made skills such as Warding has a cost equal to 3/4
                    of the NRG stat or 8 points. So someone with a gift for Warding would pay 8
                    points per point of heightened NRG in that area.</para>

                <title>Presence</title>
                <para> This enhancement reflects other people's innate awareness of the character in
                    a given area. A person with a high presence is hard to ignore. It is calculated
                    in just the same way as other enhanced stats. So Enhanced Physical Presence is 2
                    points per additional effect. Decreased Physical Presence is 2 points per
                    subtracted effect. Enhanced Mental Presence is 2 points per additional effect.
                    Decreased Mental Presence is 2 points per subtracted effect. The decreased
                    presence enhancements are, in effect, stealth enhancements. </para>

            <para>So for determining the cost of a single friend willing to help you all (Depth =
                Very High ) the time is simply 1 + 20. The DF describes how willing the person is to
