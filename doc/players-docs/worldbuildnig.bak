The Bloodlines Thousands of years ago, seven of the Nine Bright Shiners 
sacrificed their powers to create the Charter: a combination of powerful objects 
(the Great Stones and the Wall) and three magic blood lines, known as the 
Abhorsen, the Clayr and the Royal Family. Five of the Seven completely lost 
themselves (one in each object or blood line) while two remained somewhat 
independent. One invested his/her power in the Royal bloodline, one in the 
Abhorsen's and one in the Clayr's (which is why the Clayr greet Sabriel as 
"cousin"). The remaining two, known as the "Wallmakers" invested themselves in 
several objects of power, including the Stones and Wall, then disappeared. These 
artifacts, the Charter Stones, are sources of the web of Charter magic that 
maintains peace and order over the kingdom. The Bloodlines all have a higher 
concentration of strong Charter mages than the general populace.

The overall magic level is moderately high. Even the most common individual can 
have access to minor magics though not all taken advantage of this. Question to

Geography and geology

Firstly, it's not essential to draw a map in order to create a world, and you may be better off not doing so. Lois McMaster Bujold barely ever provides maps for her novels, leaving the fans to figure it out. Terry Pratchett's famous Discworld was only mapped once well over a dozen novels had been produced, by piecing together assorted references in the books. Secondly, when you do draw a map, draw one which makes sense. While it's entirely acceptable to say that the gods built this or that landform, or that a thing was created by magic, it's not really OK to produce nonsense. The Forgotten Realms world suffers especially from this, partly through being written about by several different authors. One FR novel happily places an artesian well directly above a location where the setting's originator Ed Greenwood had already established there were natural caverns. As these caverns are shown with stalagmites and stalactites, it's a reasonable bet that they're limestone or similar. Artesian wells form where the bedrock is clay. Elsewhere in the same world, a lone volcano is placed in the centre of a large bay at the edge of a continent. J R R Tolkien is nearly as bad, although Karen Wynn Fonstad's Atlas of Middle-Earth tries heroically to make it all fit.

In general, decide what forces govern the geography of your world, and make sure that the topography is consistent with them. If you envision a plate-tectonic composition for your world, work out which mountains are fold mountains and which ones are created by subduction, intrusions or parts of basin and range systems. Rivers flow over impermeable rocks but sink into permeable ones. The directions of ocean currents and prevailing winds are affected by planetary rotation. Mountains affect climate, creating rain shadows. Different kinds of caves are formed in different kinds of rock. Most are incompatible with those terribly dramatic lava flows that fantasy creators love so much. A little leeway is allowable, but someone, sooner or later, will notice if one of your centrepiece locales should have dissolved. Using magic as the explanation for such quirks will wear thin if overused.

Why not wash down all that fascinating food with a mug or two of the famous dwarven ale?

Well-document histories on dynamic periods of flux are everywhere (the writings 
of Marc Bloch, Henri Pirenne & Arnold Toynbee all specialize is the study of 
disastrous epochs) - and these make excellent role-playing backdrops

Magical creatures. Which creatures are magical and how are they magical?

Add a cataclysm or shift in magic that causes the new flow and lay lines that we 
now see with older abandoned ley lines and depleted ley pools. This would happen 
before the latest influx of people from around the world
