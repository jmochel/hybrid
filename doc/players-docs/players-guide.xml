        <title>Why</title>
        <para>There were a number of reasons for the creation of Hybrid. The first and foremost was
            the need, as I saw it, for a Role Playing Game that could comfortably model a wide range
            of the science fiction and fanasy works available. Whether attempting to run a campaign
            like that of E.E. Doc Smith's Lensman Series or the swashbuckling Star Wars movies the
            need for a consistent role playing system for all ...</para>
        <para>The second was to produce a game system in which the consistency and clarity of the
            rules would allow the Games Master to react flexibly and smoothly to the ever changing
            requirements of the players without having to lay down abitrary barriers. As part of
            this process the discussion of the rules comes complete with designer's notes. These
            notes discuss why a specific rule has been enacted and what the rationale behind what
            they model.</para>
        <para>The third goal was to produce rules that helped to cut bookkeeping down to reasonable
            levels. There is no way to avoid bookkeeping in a Role Playing Game but I have done my
            best to minimize the amount of bookkeeping necessary.</para>
        <para>I hope that Hybrid will bring you hours of enjoyment and diversion.</para>

                <para>No, no! The adventures first, explanations take such a dreadful time.</para>
            </blockquote>

                And the parts of the story that dice are used for
                are What happens and who went when...Perception, Initiative, and Success Chance

                <title>Time Scale<indexterm><primary>Time Scale</primary></indexterm></title>
                <para>We mostly work in "Mythic" or "Storytelling" Time. Time is referred to by the units we are used to, Hours, minutes, and
                    seconds. The GamesMaster (GM) typically tells the players how much time has passed and handles the sequencing and general "fairness". Sometimes, the story being told requires more detailed time keeping, we will slice time up into 
                    finer pieces.

                <title>Skill Check or Skill Roll</title>
                <para>All tasks that are undertaken in Hybrid are done by performing a Skill Check. A Skill Check is done by figuring out the chance of succeeding at a task (called the "Success Chance"
                    as a percentage (such as 86%) and rolling percentile dice (1-100) against that
                    chance. If the die roll is under the "Success Chance" then the
                    character succeeded at what they are attempting. If not, they failed. There
                    are degrees of success that range from "Oh Wow!" (Critical Success
                    <indexterm><primary>Critical Success</primary></indexterm>) to "Oh
                    No!" (Critical Failure <indexterm><primary>Critical

                <para>One Skill Check done by every character is a Perception Roll. How well a character does on a Perception Roll determines how alert a character is and how well they can react to a combat or non-combat situation. <note><para>A Perception Roll is a Skill Check and is done using percentile dice.</para></note></para>

                    expected to make good theater) we will start keeping track of time using "counts". A count is <emphasis>roughly </emphasis> one tenth of a second.<indexterm><primary>Counts</primary></indexterm><note><para>A count is <emphasis>roughly</emphasis> 1/10th of a

                <para>Most of the time a situation is self evident to a character. A character automatically
                    knows that there is a bar in the room and how many people are in it. 
                    In order to determine how much the character has "taken in" their environment the GamesMaster may ask the player to roll a Skill Check called the Perception Roll. 
                    It is just a standard percentile dice roll. As a result of the roll the GamesMaster will tell you how much the character takes in and understands. Typically , a character 
                    intentionally paying attention to the environment takes about a second to take it in. Players may also ask to make "Passive Perception" rolls to determine what their character
                    is able to take in "in passing" rather then paying attention with intent.
                </para>
                <para>To determine how quickly the character reacts or takes action there is an Initiative Roll. Initiative is rolled on two six sided dice (2d6) and the roll is modified up or down 
                    for the situation and the characters go in order of the roll (2 comes before 3, etc). </para>

                <para>If something could go unnoticed by the character, such as a suprise attack or
                    something hidden, the player should make a Perception Roll. A
                    perception roll is typically SB = PAW, DF=0, with modifiers for how alert
                    the character is trying to be. A perception roll takes 8 counts. A
                    \ndx{Passive Perception Roll} can be made \index{Perception!Passive} during
                    any action at 1/4 the success chance of a normal perception roll. A passive
                    perception roll takes no time and takes no modifiers for simultaneous
                    actions.</para>

                    <para>Your character's chance to succeed is based on how difficult the action is
                        combined with how good the character is at the skill being used to do the
                        action. The more skilled the character is at the skill the better their
                        chance to perform. The more difficult the action the worse the chance they
                        have to perform the action. <informalequation>

                <title>Difficulty of Actions</title>
                <para> Most actions have a difficulty associated with them. The Difficulty Factor is
                    expressed as a positive or negative modifier. For example DF 0 is the typical
                    average dificulty of an action. DF -5 is a more difficult action and DF +5 is an
                    easier action</para>

                <title>Rolling Dice</title>
                <para> The range of die rolls is 1-100. If you roll 00 (a 100) you roll again add
                    the second roll to the first to get our total. </para>
                <para> When percentile dice are rolled and the result is under the success chance,
                    that is a normal success. When the rolled number is significantly lower than the
                    needed roll there is a chance the action may have a greater than normal success.
                    This is called a ``Critical'' success. Table \ref{Table:CriticalSuccess} on page
                    on \index{Critical Success} page~\pageref{Table:CriticalSuccess} describes the
                    rolls needed. </para>
                <para> As an example. If a character needed to roll a 40 or under to hit a target
                    with a rock and they rolled under $ 1/2 $ of 40 then they will do 1.25 times the
                    damage they would normally do. </para>
                <para> In the case of very poor rolls there is a chance that the roll may be a
                    critical failure This is caused by rolling 50 above your success chance or
                    rolling above by $ 1/2 $ the success chance of the action, whichever is greater. </para>
                <para> So someone with a success chance of 90 needs to roll a 140 or higher to
                    critically miss while someone with a success chance of 120 needs to roll a 180
                    or higher to critically miss. </para>
                <para> To determine the severity of the critical failure roll against the amount
                    missed by as a success chance and compare the result to table \index{Critical
                    Failure} \ref{Table:CriticalFailure} on page~\pageref{Table:CriticalFailure}. </para>
                <para> There are a variety of things that can modify the chance of doing an action
                    successfully. The character can mentally prepare for the action {\em set-up} to
                    increase their chances. The action can be sped up by decreasing the chance of
                    success {\em rushing an action}. Actions can be performed simultaneously {\em
                    floretine}. There are additional modifiers for doing something while moving or
                    while tired and so on\dots</para>

            <section>
                <title>Actions/Reactions</title>
                <para>The model of tasks and actions in \SH\ is based on a series of reactions and
                    actions. When a character first enters a scene they determine how much they see
                    and understand of the situation {\em \ndx{perception roll}}. Then they determine
                    how quickly they can react {\em \ndx{initiative roll}}. The character will react
                    faster when they know what \index{Initiative} is going on and slower when they
                    don't. If a character is expecting something to happen they can prepare for that
                    occurrence {\em preset reactions} and speed up their response</para>
                <para>Once the character has reacted they determine what they will do and then do
                    the action. </para>
            </section>
            <section>
                <title>Who goes first</title>
                <para> When a character first enters a situation where action may be required they
                    must determine how much they know and how quickly they react. </para>
                <para> When a character first becomes involved in a conflict they roll a perception
                    roll. Then the PC rolls an initiative roll. The Initiative roll is simply $ 2d6
                    + 8 - Speed_{Reaction} $ added together. There are modifiers </para>
                <para> $ Speed_{Reaction} = 1/2 {Character's\ Speed } $ </para>
                <para> \index{Speed!Reaction} \[{Initiative} = 2d6 + 8 - Speed_{Reaction}\] </para>
                <para> If the perception roll is unsuccessful, the character adds a modifier to the
                    roll. </para>
                <para> \[{Initiative} = 2d6 + 8 - Speed_{Reaction} + 5\] </para>
                <para> There are, of course, modifiers to the perception roll as detailed in table
                    ~\ref{Table:PerceptionModifiers} </para>
                <para> If the initiative roll is lower than 1 the excess speed goes toward speed

                        gunfighter waiting for someone else to start drawing their weapon is a
                        preset action. Having a preset action allows the character to increase the
                        chance of detecting the triggering action and speeds up the preset action.

                <para>Actions can be performed faster. Speeding up an action lowers the chance of

                        meters. If this seems a bit short, keep in mind that a run is not a full
                        dash. At a full dash Joe would have covered twice the distance and would be

                    <para>It is important to remember that the accelleration rules should only be
                        used when the distance travelled by the characters over a {\bf short period}

                <para>In dealing with movement on a pulse by pulse scale we need to actually deal
                    with acceleration. The sequence is quite simple. Whatever the final movement
                    rate is that the character intends to use is considered the target movement
                    rate. When the character first starts moving he makes an skill roll in order to
                    start moving at the movement rate just below the target movement rate. Once the
                    roll is made the character is now moving at that lower rate. On his next
                    initiative the character may attempt to accelerate to the target movement. Note
                    that the gain number is the movement rate. If an acceleration roll is failed the
                    end result is that the character drops to the next lowest available movement
                    rate. </para>

                    initiative is determined and actions are chosen. Determine First Reaction. For
                    each of those reactions in order determine the action or attack, the damage from
                    the attack ( if any), the secondary effects of that damage ( if any). Take a

                        attacker must close to get in range to strike. If the defender is aware of
                        the attack and has a usable initiative the may actively resist the closing
                        action. To do so they must make an skill roll using a weapon to fend the
                        attacker off. Fending does not require a re-roll of initiative, the time
                        taken for the fend (same as block and parry) is simply added to the
                        defender's current initiative.</para>
                    <para>A fend is treated as any other attack form and all active defenses can be
                        performed against it. If the fend is successful and the attacker chooses to
                        ignore it the fend does normal damage for the weapon.</para>

                    <para>If an attacker has been closed upon they may choose to drop their current
                        weapon and use a shorter one, they may choose to use their current weapon as

                            or PDF for defense. This is simply an extension to the concept of

                <para>A \ndx{task} is an action or a group of actions to be performed. Each task has
                    a difficulty associated with it. That combined with the knowledge of the
                    character's rank in the skill and their stats allows us to determine the
                    percentile roll needed to succeed.</para>
                <para>To do a task the character determines the \ndx{Difficulty Factor} {\em DF} of
                    the task and what skill(s) may be used to do the task. A base chance to {\em
                    \ndx{BC}} is determined and modified by the difficulty factor of the task. </para>
                <para>Forcing a locked door is a task that has some difficulty. If the character has
                    no skill in forcing doors then they are forcing the door based on using just
                    physical strength. Their chance to force the door is based on their physical
                    strength and how difficult the door is to force. The sum total chance to force
                    the door is called the Success Chance {\em SC}.</para>
                <para>If the character has a skill in forcing doors then they will have knowledge
                    about how best to apply their physical strength to get the door open.</para>
                <para>Most players will not see a task description such as this. The GM may use
                    it.</para>

                    <title>Difficulty Factors</title>
                    <para> The difficulty of a task is described by a number referred to as an
                        ``Difficulty Factor'' or DF. Difficulty Factors for tasks typically range
                        from -10 to +4. Throughout \SH\ it is assumed that the base DF of an action
                        is 0 {\bf unless otherwise stated}. </para>
                    <para> The modifier for a task is simply 5\% times the Difficulty Factor or: \[
                        Modifier = 5 \times {Difficulty\ Factor} \] </para>
                    <para> If there are a series of actions that can be lumped together in a single
                        task the DF for the task is the average of the DFs for all the tasks. </para>
                    <para> Jogging across the street and leaping a small fence are actions that are
                        best lumped together into one task. There is no reason to ask the character
                        to roll a task roll for each action. But if the character stands the chance
                        of being exposed to someone looking for him then a roll should be made for
                        the entire set of actions. </para>
                    <para> There are some common actions and ways of describing actions that have
                        standard DFs. </para>

                    <title>Stat Basis</title>
                    <para>The task has a \ndx{stat basis} that describes what stat or combination of
                        stats can be used to do the task. This is only used if the character has
                        none of the skills in the Applicable Skills entry.</para>
                    <para>The Base Chance for someone who has no skill is \[ (3 \times SB_{skill})
                        \over {2} \]. </para>

                        weapon is fairly different from the Slug Pistol so the character can only
                        apply 1/5 of his expertise in Slug Pistol to using this pistol. So he has an

                    <para>In addition, there are skills known as support skills that are solely

                        environment other than that for which those skills were designed for.</para>
                    <para>Typical filter skills include the following: 0-g maneuver, Tech Level
                        Lore, Culture Lore, Mounted Combat, Vehicular Combat skills, Armor Wearing,
                        and Computer operations.</para>
                    <para>For situations in which the character is attempting to apply a skill in a
                        environment he is not familiar with and that skill {\em must } interact with
                        that environment, then the rank in the filter skill becomes the upper limit
                        on the effective rank of the skill being used.</para>
                    <para>As an example, if someone has a mounted combat skill at rank 5, he or she
                        may use their archery skill up to rank 5 without making any rolls against
