The magical colleges of Tanah are in many respects unlike those of
standard DQ in that they are not exclusive in principle. They are 
simply a collection of spells and rituals based on a similiar set
of principles that can be used to form a magical school.
.PP
There are a number of basic principles that each of the colleges is 
based on. 
.PP
The Principles are as follows:
.IP The Elements
An element can be summoned or shaped by will
Opposite elements striving against each other provides handles for will
.IP The Essences
Names are keys to essence
Runes are physical embodiments of names
Patterns reflect essence
.IP The Entities
Will can dominate essence

The colleges that currently exist are:
.IP The Elements
Fire, Air, Water, Earth, Light, Dark
Shadow, Starlight
.IP The Essence

a series of basic types of actions.
