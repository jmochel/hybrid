Fragments of History and Ethos:

	At the beginning there were only a few native races, known collectively
	as the ``Tor''. The first wave consisted of the ``Lordim-Tor'' or
	Lord-\=em-Tor. This stands for ``Lords-over-all-Earth''. (Centered aoround the western US?) Utah ?

	Golden haired and red eyed, wielding immense power. They brought with them 
	their own human servants. Their humans did not thrive in this new land 
	so the Lordimtor bred them to the Tor. The end result was the forerunners 
	to the Torgans. 
ngng
	Many humans were abandoned in the battles ? between who and who? they escaped to the east
	and south. What was left of the battles grounds are the badlands of Utah, Arizona, etcc...)

	The third wave was large and widespread. The Duwan and the Kurrok 
	came to one part of the continent and the elves to another.
	These races were pursued by a race called the Mergoth. The Lord 
	and the Lady batted with the Mergoth and closed the gates to this
	world. In doing so they weakened themselves so that they must 
	sleep for hundreds of years.

	Next came the Human races. Widely spread. Next came the 
	Rupa Kechil, unknown to the rest.

Important Questions

     How do the Magaflora and Fauna compete with Humans.

     How do the dieties interact.

     Where are the greater races and how to they interact ? Are they part and parcel of the Hindu culture.
