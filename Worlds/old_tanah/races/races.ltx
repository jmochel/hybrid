\chapter*{Introduction}

The following are the races and cultures in
the world of Tanah. Many of these may be known to the world by other
names and some may be almost unknown or mythical in reputation.
Player Characters are unlikely to know about all the other races.

\section*{The Non-Huan Races}

The races are listed here with the actual name followed by a
simple common name. Some of these races are similiar to what
players may already encountered, but most of them are {\it very}
different. There are a number of races that play a major part in the
world as NPCs. Those races are not typically available to players.
An example is the TakkanDari or Drow Elves.

The non-human races are listed below along with a brief note to help 
bring a useful image to mind:

\begin{itemize}
        \item [Rupa Kechil (R\={u}-pa K\={e}-Chil)] Shapeshifters
        \item [Bitadari (Bit-a-dar-r\={e})] Elves
        \item [TakkanDari (Tak-kan-dar-r\={e})] Dark Elves
