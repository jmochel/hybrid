\author{J.Mochel}
\maketitle

The magical colleges of Tanah are in many respects unlike those of
standard DQ in that they are not exclusive in principle. They are 
simply a collection of spells and rituals based on a similiar set
of principles that can be used to form a magical school.

There are a number of basic principles that each of the colleges is 
based on. 

The Principles are as follows:
\begin{description}
	\item[The Elements]
	An element can be summoned or shaped by will
	Opposite elements striving against each other provides handles for will
	\item[The Essences]
	Names are keys to essence
	Runes are physical embodiments of names
	Patterns reflect essence
	\item[The Entities]
	Will can dominate essence
\end{description}

The colleges that currently exist are:
\begin{description}
	\item[The Elementals]
	Fire, Air, Water, Earth, Light, Dark
	Shadow, Starlight
	\item[The Essences]
	Naming, Rune, Shaping
	\item[The Entities]
	Greater Summmoning, Lesser Summoning
\end{description}
