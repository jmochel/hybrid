                              BEFORE TIME WAS.....



Before time was, there was The One; The One was all & all was The One.

And the vast expanse known as the Universe was The One, allwise, all-pervading, 
all-powerful, eternally changing.

And Space moved. The One molded energy into twin forms equal but opposite, 
fashioning the Goddess and God from The One and of The One.

The Goddess & God stretched and gave thanks to The One, but darkness surrounded 
them. They were alone, solitary save for The One.

So they formed energy into gases and gases into suns and planets and moons; They 
sprinkled the Universe with whirling globes and so all was given shape by the 
hands of the Goddess and God. Light arose and the sky was illuminated by a 
billion suns. and the Goddess and Gods, satisfied by their works, rejoiced and 
loved, and were one.

From their union sprang seeds of life, and of the human race, so that we might 
achieve incarnation upon the Earth.

The Goddess chose the Moon as her symbol, and the God the Sun as his symbol to 
remind the inhabitants of Earth of their fashioners.

All are born, live, die and are reborn beneath The Sun and Moon; all things come 
to pass there under, and all occurs with the blessings of The One, as has been 
the way of existence before time was.
