1 Mil BCE&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;A homo erectus skull from Daka, Ethiopia,
from this time was identified in 2001 as an ancestor to all modern
humans. Tim D. White and Berhani Asfaw led the team that discovered the
fossils in 1997.<br>

of a human in Java, Indonesia that he named Pithecanthropus erectus
[Java Man]. The first Homo erectus skullcap was found near Trinil, Java.<br>

400-300,000&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Articulate speech becomes possible
according to Dr. Laitman, anatomist at the Mt. Sinai School of
Medicine. His studies show that the degree to which the base of the
skull is flexed, or bent, is indicative of whether the larynx can move
up or down. Early Homo skulls are only slightly flexed at the base, so
that full command of articulate speech was a later development.<br>
