<hr width="100%">70 Million&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The triangular
continental plate we know as the subcontinent was once part of
Antarctica. Some seventy million years ago it began drifting northward
toward Asia.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(NH, 5/96, p.10)<br>
70 Mil BP&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In 2004 scientists reported the discovery
in Antarctica of a small meat-eating therapod dinosaur from this time.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(SFC, 2/27/04, p.A2)<br>
70 Million&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The North Atlantic and Greenland ridges,
Iceland and other islands are all made up of rocks younger than 70
million years. This date seems to mark the time till which Laurasia was
intact.<br>

70 Million&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The giant Mosasaurus reptile head, found
in the Netherlands near Maastricht in 1794, roamed the seas about this
time.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(NYT, 6/7/96, p.A4)<br>
70 Million&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Skulls of Mongolian fossil birds from this
time were found c1997 in the Gobi desert. They were named Shuvuui
deserti. The skeleton was that of a bird but the stubby arms indicated
that it could not have flown. A fossil bird from Madagascar that lived
about this time was also reported found and named Rahona ostromi.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(SFC, 3/19/98, p.A1,9)(SFC, 5/6/99, p.A8)<br>
<br>
70-65 Million&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Wangshi Formation in China&#8217;s
Shandong Province contains a site with T-Rex dinosaur eggs (Tarbosaurus
to the Chinese). The eggs measure as much as 18 inches long.
Tyrannosaurus (terrible lizard) was first identified in 1905 by H.F.
Osborn.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(SFME, 5/7/95, P.5)<br>
70-65 Million&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Boundary of the Cretaceous-Tertiary
zones. This is the period in which the dinosaurs become extinct. A
theory by Louis Alvarez and others in 1980AD proposes that the earth
was impacted by a large meteor around this time that caused worldwide
darkness, massive deforestation from fire, an enormous amount of soot,
prolonged cold, and a severe depletion of atmospheric oxygen that
lasted months. Lack of sunlight would have also caused the death of
photoplankton in the oceans and an oxygen drop in the oceans. The
theory is supported by a thin layer of dark clay containing iridium, an
element more common in meteors than on the surface of the earth, that
has been found in a number of locations around the world.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(TMP, KCTS-Video, 1987)<br>
70-65 Mil&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The earliest fossil of a modern land bird
was found in eastern Montana in the 1960s. More primitive birds with
teeth did not survive the Great Extinction.<br>

around the world.<br>

this time.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(SFC, 3/16/00, p.A17)<br>
<br>
66 million&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Scientists in 2000 reported that the 66
million-year-old plant-eating dinosaur, Thescelosaurus (marvelous
lizard), had a 4-chambered heart and was likely warm-blooded.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(SFC, 4/21/00, p.A1)<br>
<br>
65.7 Million&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Some animal species began to suffer and
a few went extinct.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(WSJ, 3/2/04, p.B1)<br>
<br>
65.3 Million&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;About this time a comet struck the area
of the Mexican Yucatan Peninsula and created a crater, known today as
Chicxulub, about 150-180 miles (200 km) in diameter. The area at this
time was covered by ocean. The asteroid is believed to have been 6-12
miles (10 km) in diameter. Evidence for this was gathered by Luis
Alvarez. In 1997 Walter Alvarez published "T. Rex and the Crater of
Doom," an account of this critical event. The impact was estimated at 5
billion times greater than the atomic bombs of WW II.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(SFC, 2/18/96, p.A3)(SFEC, 8/17/97, BR p.7)(NH,
9/97, p.85)(WSJ, 3/2/04, p.B1)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The asteroid that struck Earth
wiped out the dinosaurs, about 80% of the world&#8217;s plants species and
all animals bigger than a cat. In 2002 it also was estimated to have
wiped out 55-60% of the plant-eating insects. A high oxygen level may
have contributed to a worldwide firestorm.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(Pac. Disc., summer, &#8216;96, p.46)<br>
65 million&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;A 50-foot female T. rex of about this age
was discovered on a Cheyenne River Reservation in South Dakota by Sue
Hendrickson in 1990. The government seized the skeleton in 1992 and in
1997 it was put up for auction by Sotheby&#8217;s on behalf of Maurice
Williams, a Sioux Indian and owner of the ranch where it was found. The
proceeds were to be held in trust by the government.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(SFEC, 9/28/97, p.A13)<br>
c65 Million&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;T. rex "Sue" ate a Duckbill dinosaur and
was herself mauled by another T. rex in South Dakota. She died in a
slow moving stream near the shore of a vast inland sea that bisected
North America, and was buried under a protective layer of sand.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(SFC,12/897, p.A4)<br>
65 Million&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In 2003 US and Indian scientists reported
on a new dinosaur species from western India from this time. They named
it Rajasaurus narmadensis, or "Regal reptile from the Narmada," after
the Narmada River region where the bones were found.<br>

60 Million &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;During the last 60 or so million years
the break-up of Pangaea continued with continents drifting northwards
and for the most part away from one another. The shapes of the
continents as we know them today began to clarify and the great
Alpine-Himalayan mountains rose from Tethys. In the Americas the
Cordilleran ranges of the west were pushed up and volcanoes rumbled.
For the first time New Zealand can be seen as a separate entity, broken
off as Australia moved northwards.<br>

60 Million&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;By the middle Paleocene on the branch that
led to living Cetacea there evolved the Mesonychia with blunted,
meat-eating dentition and a trotting gait. They were possibly
scavengers and are found on all northern continents. the transition to
whales began when mesonychians went into the water to feed with a
change in dentition. Next to change were the ears and then the
reduction of the sacrum for tail-powered swimming.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eocene rocks and fossils of
Spitsbergen, now at latitude 75 degrees north, tell us that the climate
was warm or sub-tropical, with coal swamps covering hundreds of square
miles of lowland. After the separation of Greenland from Scandinavia
the colder waters of the polar basin would have mingled with the North
Atlantic. The closed North Atlantic Ocean circulation was, by linking
with the polar basin, changed to a more productive system for
supporting a large and varied biota.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even as early as the Eocene
period there were several kinds of whales, including a slender
fearsomely toothed beast (Zeuglodon), as much as 20 meters long.<br>

<br>
51-50 Million&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The first whales, the Archeoceti, came
from the late-early Eocene. The earliest of the archeoceti are called
pakicetids and are quite similar to mesonychians. They were found in
Pakistan with a land-mammal fauna in continental deposits.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(LSA, Spg/97, p.7)<br>
<br>
50 Million&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Tethys Sea southern edge was the
habitat of Pakicetus inachus, a small, land mammal (whale ancestor,
pakicetids) that walked on four legs and ate fish from the shallows of
the Tethys. This area is presently a rocky, mountainous desert in
Northern Pakistan. Pakicetus had ears apparently adapted for underwater
use.<br>

<br>
50-42 Million&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Green River Formation rocks are
remnants of an ancient lake that covered more than 25,000 square miles
of Colorado, Utah and Wyoming. Lake Uinta, Lake Gosiute, and Fossil
Lake were deposited in this period. The Green River formation is known
for deposits such as coal and oil shale, and for limestone containing
abundant fish fossils in mass mortality layers. Fossils include the
herring-like Knightia alta, and less frequently, other fish such as
Priscacara, Mioplosus, Phareodus, and Diplomystus. Rare ancestral manta
rays, palm leaves and birds have also been found.<br>

fused and allowed for tail-powered swimming.<br>

too weak to support its body on land, Gingerich believes it spent its
entire life in the ocean. It reached about 40 feet.<br>
