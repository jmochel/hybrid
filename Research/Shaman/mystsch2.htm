<H4>Chapter 7</H4>
<H3>The Less Mysteries</H3>
<P>The Less Mysteries are a preparation of the neophyte, through various
degrees of purification and discipline combined with training in intellectual
and spiritual perception, for initiation in the Greater Mysteries. As indicated
in the previous chapter, seven were the degrees usually reckoned, the first
three degrees comprising the Less Mysteries. The fourth degree is the turning or
deciding point: in this degree the discipline and training undergone in the
preliminary stages are put to the test of <EM>actual experience</EM> in
self-identification. If the candidate passes this fourth trial successfully,
then he enters upon the sterner discipline, the far greater purification, and
the more intimate relationship between teacher and pupil. Henceforth he is a
pledged disciple, his will is set firmly to do or die, and thus to pass
successfully the fifth, sixth, and seventh degrees which comprise the Greater
Mysteries.
</P>
<P>The trials of the Less Mysteries are comparatively simple in the first
degree; but as the disciple proves his earnestness and ability to stand the
probationary tests, the training becomes more rigorous, the demands upon his
nature more severe, and the hand of karma deals more heavily with error.
</P>
<P>Two particular features mark the Minor Mysteries: (a) instruction in the
deeper sciences of the cosmos; and (b) dramatic presentations of that which the
neophyte must <EM>experience in actual fact</EM>, and endure without outside
help, in the Greater Mysteries. In the Eleusinian Mysteries for example, the
neophyte himself took the main part in the sacred drama which acted as a
spiritual aid in stimulating the yearning for actual experience in these higher
things, as well as familiarizing him with the routes, so to say, of the
initiation chamber. To take the part as an actor in a drama is quite a different
thing from suffering actual experience, yet such participation acted as
preliminary fortification to the neophyte when the time actually came for the
greater initiations.
</P>
<P>The Less Mysteries have been known and recognized by the keenest minds of
all ages as institutions of higher learning, in which candidates were allowed to
take the first initiation only after they had proved themselves worthy and fit
to pass higher.
</P>
<P>From the Mystery schools, knowledge of truth permeates the mental strata of
the surrounding country, as initiates in the preliminary degrees pass out again
into the human world. In Greece and Rome it might be said that nearly all the
really great men of historic note were initiates of one or more degrees of the
Less Mysteries. This does not, however, refer to conquerors by the sword, for
almost universally these were not initiates of the Mysteries, though in the
degenerate days of the Roman Empire many were the applicants of indifferent
caliber who underwent the preliminary rites in a more or less perfunctory
fashion.
</P>
<P>In fact, the Mysteries in olden times were regarded so highly that
preparation for entrance was deemed the most royal gift a father could bequeath
his sons. At the age of seven years, young boys were received and trained,
disciplined in heart and mind, so that on reaching adulthood they either took
their places in the world and exerted a spiritual influence among the people; or
if they were especially favored by right of inner fineness, they remained within
the sanctuary and passed on as far as they could go into the Greater Mysteries.
Certain ones were trained for the sole purpose of returning to society and
teaching the laws of life in university and college; others received the
preliminary rites to better fit themselves to govern the State with equanimity
and honor. Still others underwent the discipline and purification of the first
degrees and then devoted their lives to bringing beauty to mankind, whether in
sculpture or color, in verse or harmony. Thus did these early civilizations
ripen in spiritual things under the guidance of initiated philosophers and
statesmen, artists and musicians.
</P>
<P>Many branches of both art and science were taught in the Less Mysteries,
notably geography, astronomy, chemistry, physiology, geology, meteorology, as
well as music, the &quot;most divine and <EM>spiritual </EM>of arts&quot; (<CITE>Mahatma
Letters</CITE>, p. 188); similarly art and architecture were studied whose lost &quot;canon
of proportion&quot; has immortalized the Greek temples. These sciences were held
as secret studies of the Mysteries, not because they would not have been
understood if taught as our schoolrooms and universities teach them today, but
because such sciences and arts were studied from their <EM>causal </EM>rather
than their effectual aspect. Much derision has been cast on the ancients for
withholding this knowledge, when even a child can understand its simpler forms.
Certainly the simpler forms were taught to the multitude, but their <EM>occult
</EM>background was kept rigidly secret (as it is even today, though the world
at large little dreams of this fact) as fit only for those who would not abuse
the knowledge obtained. Can as much wisdom be shown today, when as soon as
science discovers some new device, instantly opportunity is found by the
unregenerate to turn that invention to diabolic purposes? One is driven to
admire the strength and wisdom of the ancients who knew better than to turn
knowledge over completely to those lacking in moral control. Even yet, with all
our boasted superiority, we have not caught up in all lines with the ordinary
scientific knowledge of our ancient forebears.
</P>
<P>As H. P. Blavatsky wrote in 1877:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>If modern masters are so much in advance of the old ones, why do they not
restore to us the lost arts of our postdiluvian forefathers? Why do they not
give us the unfading colors of Luxor -- the Tyrian purple; the bright vermilion
and dazzling blue which decorate the walls of this place, and are as bright as
on the first day of their application? The indestructible cement of the pyramids
and of ancient aqueducts; the Damascus blade, which can be turned like a
corkscrew in its scabbard without breaking; the gorgeous, unparalleled tints of
the stained glass that is found amid the dust of old ruins and beams in the
windows of ancient cathedrals; and the secret of the true malleable glass? And
if chemistry is so little able to rival even with the early mediaeval ages in
some arts, why boast of achievements which, according to strong probability,
were perfectly known thousands of years ago? The more archaeology and philology
advance, the more humiliating to our pride are the discoveries which are daily
made, the more glorious testimony do they bear in behalf of those who, perhaps
on account of the distance of their remote antiquity, have been until now
considered ignorant flounderers in the deepest mire of superstition. -- <CITE>Isis
Unveiled</CITE> 1:239
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In the Mysteries, geography is not a study of ordinary topography, the
location of rivers and mountains, valleys and plains; rather were the periodical
risings and sinkings of continents the subject of investigation in accordance
with the cyclic events of racial history; secret centers of the earth were
learned of, and our intimate relation to the two poles and the four points of
the compass. As HPB suggestively hints:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The two poles are called the right and left ends of our globe -- the right
being the North Pole -- or the head and feet of the earth. Every beneficent
(astral and cosmic) action comes from the North; every lethal influence from the
South Pole. They are much connected with and influence <EM>&quot;right&quot;
and &quot;left&quot; hand magic</EM>. -- <CITE>The Secret Doctrine</CITE>
2:400n
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Meteorology is the study of the currents of wind and rain, not from the
effectual standpoint but as bearing streams of vital energy from all parts of
the solar system. Lightning and thunder, etc., were not merely electromagnetic
phenomena -- words that sound imposing, but unless occultly understood convey
little more than a statement of effects produced -- but when considered from the
causal aspect are seen to be but outer manifestations of interior forces
bursting from cosmic space into our atmosphere and affecting the lives of earth.
</P>
<P>In Chaldea, Egypt, Mexico and Peru, Wales and India, astrology was regarded
with veneration. Its deeper teachings were transmitted from mouth to ear, so
sacred and profoundly spiritual were they then considered. Mere fortune telling
and other similar trifles were held vulgar in the eyes of the hierophants. The
recognized influences of the sun and planets upon the human beings on earth were
not considered merely mechanical reactions compelling individuals to this and
that mode of conduct or of character; such interchange of planetary and solar
life energies between terrestrial beings was understood as springing from a
common heritage of solar birth. The septenary nature of the planets was taken
into account in reckoning septenary human nature, and hence the intermingling of
life-atoms from the various planetary systems with the earth, and vice versa,
constitutes one of the major studies of esoteric astrology. Furthermore, the
science of prediction of tremendous cyclic occurrences was mastered not only in
India to a fine hair's breadth (see the <CITE>Surya-Siddhanta</CITE> of
Asuramaya, the oldest treatise on astronomy extant), but also in ancient
Chaldea, whose modern representatives of some four and five thousand years ago
still held archaic astrology as the strongest characteristic of their secret
Mysteries. The famous ziggurat or high tower of Borsippa in Babylonia is clear
testimonial to knowledge of the sevenfold planetary influences on humanity.
Called the stages of the seven spheres, each of its stories bore a different
color, representative of one of the seven sacred planets. At the top was a
sacred shrine, often with a table or couch of solid gold.
</P>
<P>Thus what looked to the multitude as mere astronomical observatories were
secret training centers within whose inner recesses esoteric astrology formed
one of the important studies of the Less Mysteries. Medicine and surgery,
physics and alchemy, poetry, mathematics, and philosophy likewise were studied
from their inner standpoint. This instruction consists not in the learning by
rote of scores of formulae, but in the inner perception of occult rationale, so
that knowledge benevolently applied for others becomes wisdom.
</P>
<P>However fascinating to the imagination and of whatever degree of
intellectual and psychic stimulation to the neophyte, these studies were not the
major aim of the Mysteries, for behind all training of the mind was the <EM>impelling
urge for soul purification through discipline and contemplation</EM>. As
stimulus and guidance, dramatic presentations were given of the actual descent
of the candidate into the underworld, his trial in the nether regions through
meeting and conquering himself, his ascent into the stream of life and light,
culminating in final communion and &quot;friendship&quot; with the divinities.
So effective were the dramatic rites that participation in them actually
constituted part of the initiatory training in preparation for the Greater
Mysteries.
</P>
<P>Comparison of the ritual of these Mysteries as practiced in Mexico, Peru,
Egypt, Greece, and Rome, in Wales, Persia, and India, with slight variations of
minor detail, reveals the universal presence of the story of the descent into
the underworld in the symbol of the wheat or corn goddess. The seed and the
grain represents the candidate. As the seed enters into the dark regions of the
moist earth, many are the difficulties of soil and environment to contend with;
it &quot;dies&quot; in giving birth to root and stalk. Finally as the period of
germination expires the tender shoots of the grain sprout above the surface of
the earth; other plants welcome the newcomer, and in time the seed-that-was
bursts forth in flower with the aid of the sun. Thus the candidate must &quot;die&quot;
in the regions of the underworld, the lower spheres, where he meets and conquers
the difficulties of environment; shedding his impermanent self he dies in giving
birth to root and stalk of budding masterhood. At the appropriate hour, the
disciple that was rises to the spheres of light and life; taken into the
presence of other plants of divinity, he finds friendship with the gods and
blooms into the full flower of adepthood. Thus is dramatized in esoteric imagery
the spiritual travail &quot;<EM>of giving birth to themselves</EM>&quot; -- as
an ancient manuscript describes the birth of the adept within the neophyte, the
supreme initiation. (See <CITE>The Secret Doctrine</CITE> 2:559.) </P>
<HR>
<H4><A NAME="chapter8">Chapter 8</A></H4>
<H3>The Greater Mysteries</H3>
<P>The Greater Mysteries entered upon by the neophyte after the successful
consummation of the preliminary degrees constitute the becoming by individual
experience that which had been learned in the Less Mysteries. In this higher
department of esoteric training, no quarter is given. The neophyte must face
himself and conquer -- or die. All the stretches of his complex nature, from the
divinely inspired to the grossly material, must be investigated and controlled.
By this time the aspirant must have developed sufficient spiritual stability to
withstand reality. He must <EM>become</EM> nature in her lower and higher
regions, pass the supreme test of self-identification, and yet retain his soul
integrity.
</P>
<P>Even as late as the second century, the rites of the Egyptian Mysteries,
however modified by Greek influence, were carried on with due and appropriate
reverence. Disciples from surrounding countries sought initiation there as a
fitting advancement following their own ceremonies. Apuleius, the Latin Platonic
philosopher, describes in his <CITE>Metamorphoses</CITE>, or <CITE>The Golden
Ass</CITE>, the initiation in the Mysteries of Isis of one Lucius Patras, now
uniformly believed to be Apuleius himself:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;Hear, then, and believe, for what I tell is true. I drew nigh to the
confines of death, I trod the threshold of Proserpine [Hades], I was borne
through all the elements and returned to earth again. I saw the sun gleaming
with bright splendour at dead of night, I approached the gods above, and the
gods below, and worshipped them face to face. Behold, I have told thee things of
which, though thou hast heard them, thou must yet know naught.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;I will recount, therefore, only that which may without sin be imparted
to the understanding of the uninitiate. So soon as it was morning and the rites
were accomplished, I came forth clothed in twelve cloaks that are worn by the
initiate, a raiment that is most holy. . . . The precious cloak hung from my
shoulders down my back, even to my heels, and I was adorned, wheresoever thou
mightest cast thine eye, with the figures of beasts broidered round about in
diverse colours.* . . . This cloak the initiates call the cloak of Olympus. In
my right hand I bore a torch flaming with fire, and my head was garlanded with a
fair crown of spotless palm, whose leaves stood out like rays . . . adorned as
the sun and set up like to the image of a god.&quot; -- quoted in <CITE>The
Mysteries of Egypt</CITE>, Lewis Spence, pp. 70-1
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>[*The reference to the twelve cloaks and the figures of beasts is quite
clearly a veiled manner of suggesting the mystic passage through the twelve
signs of the zodiac.]
</P>
<P>In the Greater Mysteries, the passage into the underworld ceases to be a
mere ritual of the Less Mysteries in which the candidate takes the chief part in
a dramatic rite; he must now &quot;approach the confines of death&quot; with
full knowledge, and in the garment of soul-consciousness pass beyond the veil of
visible nature into the arena of worlds invisible:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>It is one of the fundamental teachings of occultism that nothing can be
<EM>truly known</EM> which is not <EM>experienced, lived through</EM>. . . .
different stages or degrees of initiation are really a kind of forcing-process,
for certain chosen spirits, certain chosen souls, who have proved themselves
worthy: . . . These different stages or degrees of initiation are marked by
preparatory purifications, first. Then came the &quot;death,&quot; a mystic
death. The body and lower principles, so to say, are paralyzed, and the soul is
temporarily freed. And, to a certain extent, the freed inner man is guided and
directed and helped by the initiators while it passes into other spheres and to
other planes and learns the nature of these <EM>by becoming them</EM>, which is
the only way by which knowledge thereof roots itself into the soul, into the
ego: by <EM>becoming the thing</EM>. --
<CITE>Fundamentals of the Esoteric Philosophy</CITE>, p. 258-9
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This mystic death constitutes the fourth initiation, which consists not only
in one's ability to receive spiritual light, but likewise in one's power to face
with equanimity and awakened morality the darkness of evil. To <EM>become a
thing</EM> is actually to unite one's cognizing intelligence with the essence of
the being or thing become. In other words, to <EM>take on the nature</EM> of
such entity for the time being. Hence to weld one's consciousness with beings in
spheres <EM>lower </EM>than the human is greatly to test the stamina of the
individual: will the malefic fumes of the lower spheres stifle the delicate
petals of the budding adept? Will the sensuous delights of the lower hells have
any attraction for the neophyte stern in his resolve to face all? Conversely, to
assume the nature of beings in spheres <EM>higher
</EM>than the human calls for an equally strengthened constitution. Will the
brilliance and splendor of truth undimmed blind the soul? Will vision of reality
shatter the Eye of Dangma, the eye of wisdom?
</P>
<P>This fourth degree may be considered a prelude to, a minor reflection of,
the final and seventh degree, in which initiation the neophyte-initiant must
undergo the trial of identification with <EM>all</EM> the spheres of being. To
complete the full initiatory cycle, therefore, demands the awakening and
strengthening of <EM>all seven</EM> human principles. The candidate must have
so tuned his seven-stringed lyre, so energized it with spiritual harmony, that
it will vibrate in perfect synchrony with the <EM>spiritual</EM> essence of the
seven principles or spheres of the cosmos. As the Master KH wrote to A. 0. Hume
in 1882: &quot;The degrees of an Adept's initiation mark the seven stages at
which he discovers the secret of the sevenfold principles in nature and man and
awakens his dormant powers.&quot; (<CITE>Mahatma Letters</CITE>, p. 99.)
</P>
<P>Of these higher degrees scarcely anything of precise detail is known. This
is but natural, and indeed is inevitable; for how could words describe that
which can be understood only by the initiate? How could that which is
essentially esoteric be revealed and still retain its mystic integrity?
Important hints, however, have been given regarding the fifth, sixth, and
seventh degrees.
</P>
<P>In the fifth initiation, the neophyte &quot;<EM>meets his own god-self face
to face</EM>, and for a longer or shorter time <EM>becomes one with it</EM>.&quot;
(<CITE>Fundamentals of the Esoteric Philosophy</CITE>, p. 283) This degree was
called by the Greeks theophany, a word signifying &quot;divine appearance&quot;
or &quot;showing forth of a divinity,&quot; the appearance or manifestation of
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>man's own higher self to himself. And while in the average candidate this
sublime moment of intellectual ecstasis and high vision lasted but a short time,
with further spiritual progress of the candidate the theophanic communion became
more enduring and lasting, until finally, ultimately, man knew himself, not
merely as the offspring spiritually of his own inner god, but as that inner god
itself, in his essential being. -- <CITE>Fundamentals of the Esoteric
Philosophy</CITE>, p. 447
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The sixth initiation was consummated as the inevitable course of events
following upon the successful spiritualization of the entire nature. This was
called theopneusty by the Greeks -- a word literally signifying &quot;god-breathing&quot;
or &quot;divine inspiration&quot; -- where the disciple
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>felt the inbreathing from his own inner god and became, thus, inspired, the
very word inspiration meaning &quot;inbreathing.&quot; With the passing of time
and the greater purification of the soul-vehicle, which is man himself, this
inbreathing or inspiration became permanent. -- <CITE>Fundamentals of the
Esoteric Philosophy</CITE>, p. 447
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In this degree &quot;the inner god of the candidate breathes down into him,
for a longer or shorter time, depending upon his advancement, the wisdom and the
knowledge of all the universe . . .&quot;; and &quot;in the sixth degree,
instead of one's own Higher Self, the initiant meets another One, . . .&quot; (<CITE>Fundamentals
of the Esoteric Philosophy</CITE>, pp. 284, 260.)
</P>
<P>Then comes the seventh and last of the degrees of initiation before
masterhood is achieved. This initiation usually took place at the winter
solstice, when the sun starts again on its northward journey. The ancient pagan
initiates considered the four points of the year, the winter and summer
solstices and the spring and autumnal equinoxes, as physical representatives of
holy workings in the cosmos. The birth of the sun at the beginning of the year
symbolized to them the mystic birth of the initiate, and it is significant that
nearly all the great world saviors, such as Jesus the Christ, Krishna the
Avatara, Apollonius of Tyana, and others, celebrate their &quot;birthdays&quot;
at this sacred time of the rebirth of the solar deity.
</P>
<P>This seventh degree, called by the Greeks theopathy -- a word meaning &quot;god-suffering&quot;
or &quot;divine-enduring&quot; -- was the
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>most sublime mystery of all . . . the initiant, the candidate, suffered
himself to become, abandoned himself fully to be, a truly selfless channel of
communication of his own inner god, his own higher self; he became lost as it
were in the greater self of his own higher self. -- <CITE>Fundamentals of the
Esoteric Philosophy</CITE>, p. 447
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Few indeed are those whose soul strength is so great that they can suffer or
endure in fullness the presence of divinity. This is the reward of the highest
adepts, those whose sacrifice and wisdom surround humanity with a guardian wall
diamond-like in compassion and adamantine in protection.
</P>
<P>In the seventh degree, the neophyte passes the portals of the sun; &quot;<EM>he
becomes for a passing moment the Wondrous Watcher himself</EM>&quot; (ibid., p.
260) -- the solar initiation is complete: the neophyte dies, and the hierophant
is born.</P>
<HR>
<H4><A NAME="chapter9">Chapter 9</A></H4>
<H3>Routes of Initiation</H3>
<P>In the deeper mystery-training, the pupil must not only learn to build the
mystic vessel of awakened consciousness which will carry him from plane to
plane, but in the process of such individual becoming must rediscover for
himself the ancient routes of initiation.
</P>
<P>In wisdom and foresight, nature is consistent throughout: one law, one plan,
one structure. With charming thrift she rehearses the pathways of initiation
through the rhythm of sleep and death. To understand even in minor degree the
Greater Mysteries, one must have a thorough grounding in the teachings of death.
Death and its processes form the heart and core of the initiation doctrine:
through death of the inferior the superior finds birth. Except the seed die, the
flower cannot bloom; except the flower die, the seed cannot form. &quot;He that
loseth his life for my sake shall find it&quot; (Matt. 10:39).
</P>
<P>Sleep is an incomplete death -- unconsciously performed; death is a complete
sleep -- unconsciously performed; initiation is a self-conscious sleep or death
of the lower elements with an equally self-cognizing liberation of the spiritual
soul along the same pathways of sleep and death.
</P>
<P>In sleep the body is cast aside, &quot;dies&quot; imperfectly, for the
golden cord remains linked in spiritual protection to the slumbering body. If
the soul is not weighted with material desire, then a natural paralysis of the
terrestrial elements ensues. During the brief hours of nightly sleep, if the
karma be favorable the freed spirit-soul may ascend out of the sphere of earth
along the invisible magnetic pathways to higher realms. The ascent is
instantaneous, followed by the immediate return along identic pathways until the
soul once again enters the sleeping body and a new day dawns.
</P>
<P>These pathways of sleep traversed night after night constitute an <EM>unconscious
</EM>journey along the routes of initiation. Such momentary and unrecognized
contact during sleep is not wasted; the very repetition of the self-same process
acts as a kind of invisible spur to the ordinary person: if the aspirations are
continued and life made purer, faint impressions of beauty and grandeur will
penetrate the dulled soul, intuitions will manifest, and the aspirant will find
benediction sweeping into his day through nightly communion with higher spheres.
</P>
<P>Death is the following of the same processes of sleep, only perfectly so.
The body is cast off permanently and falls apart; the golden cord is withdrawn,
and the soul, freed of its terrestrial elements, enters the spheres of temporary
purgation. Liberated and cleansed of earthly dross in the kama-loka, the soul
ascends to its spiritual parent, the higher self, and in peace and bliss
undreamed of travels the identic journey of sleep. In each of the mansions of
space, a stop is made, shorter or longer depending upon the links of affinity
formerly made through past experience of the spiritual soul, until strengthened
by divine contact, it once again re-threads the ancient pathway, and a child is
born on earth.
</P>
<P>Thus in death the age-old routes of initiation are perfectly followed in
conscious recognition by the spiritual monad, but as yet in unconscious
appreciation of inherent values by the ordinary human soul.
</P>
<P>A human being is many-sided: he has within him a divine monad, a spiritual
soul, and a human soul which works through his vital-astral-physical nature. We
must guard against the dominion of the lower over the higher and, particularly
in our discussion of these holy things, must carefully watch ourselves lest we
become fascinated by their beauty and intellectual splendor, and forget the
essential strength of the Mysteries: that of ethics. Unless an individual has
made ethics the foundation of his character, then his heart and mind will be
continually shaken by the storm of desire. The multitude who care for little
beyond the needs of the ordinary mind and body will have no attraction to deeper
things, but those who have begun to think and feel intuitively will find
themselves irresistibly drawn to the study of the ancient wisdom. It is to these
already stirring from the sleep of matter that particular warning is given
against entertaining the notion that initiation is just waiting around the
corner. One must defend the heart from selfish desire for so-called occult
powers as one would defend oneself against the bite of the serpent. The
initiations referred to, particularly in the previous chapter, are not <EM>described</EM>
but only alluded to in vague words, as hints of what someday the worthy disciple
may find himself fortunate enough to experience.
</P>
<P>Over and over again the journey of initiation is traversed: in sleep
imperfectly, in death perfectly; nightly by the soul in sleep, periodically by
the soul in death. Unconsciously performed, nature thus rehearses that which the
soul must one day follow with will and consciousness fully active. This latter
process is the journey of initiation: the deliberate paralysis of terrestrial
influence followed by the self-perceptive journey through every plane and sphere
of the cosmos.
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The purpose of the passing of the Monad post-mortem through the various
planetary chains is to allow it to free itself on each such planetary chain of
the integument or habiliment or vehicle which belongs to the vital essence of
such planetary chain. It is only thus that the Monad strips off from itself one
after the other the different 'coatings' with which it has enwrapped itself
during its long evolutionary journey; and thus when it has freed itself from all
seven 'coatings' it is then ready, because freed and in its pure and 'unclothed'
state, to enter into its own native spiritual Home. When the return journey
towards Earth's planetary chain begins, the Monad then passes through all these
same seven planets, but in reverse order to that by which it had ascended
through them, and in each such planet that it visits . . . it picks up and
re-assumes or clothes itself in the life-atoms forming the 'coatings' that it
had previously dropped or cast off in each one of these seven planets
respectively. -- <CITE>The Esoteric Tradition</CITE>, p. 869-70
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>So important is this journey that the Greater Mysteries dealt almost in
their entirety with processes of the mystic death. As described in the previous
chapter, the fourth initiation comprised a partial descent in the lower spheres,
accompanied by the partial ascent into the superior spheres. The soul as yet has
not developed sufficient strength to withstand the full reaches of the universe.
</P>
<P>There is a legend of Babylonia which points to a tradition of esotericism to
be found in one guise or another in all lands and in all Mystery schools.
Ishtar, bereft of her lover Tammuz through death, descends to the underworld to
restore him to life and immortality. Arriving at the gates of Aralu [Hades],
Ishtar stands, beautiful and royal. The archaic decree, however, demands that
none may enter the dread precincts of the underworld who are not bare of garment
or jewel.
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;Therefore at each of the successive gates through which Ishtar must
pass, the keeper divests her of some garment or ornament: first her crown, then
her ear-rings, then her necklace, then the ornaments from her bosom, then her
many-jeweled girdle, then the spangles from her hands and feet, and lastly her
loin-cloth.&quot; -- Will Durant, <CITE>The Story of Civilization</CITE>, vol.

<P>Free and pure she enters Aralu. Her sister, Ereshkigal, full of jealousy,
sends against Ishtar sixty diseases. Passing the tests of the lower world,
Ishtar releases Tammuz, and through her love and self-sacrifice he now receives
immortality. Triumphant, she retraces her steps through the seven gates,
receiving in reverse order those garments or jewels which she had cast aside on
her descending journey, and finally as she ascends into the regions of light she
is adorned with the seventh jewel, the crown of spiritual glory.
</P>
<P>This descent is not an automatic process, but a <EM>spiritually
</EM>willing decision to undertake the journey as a supreme test of intellectual
and spiritual integrity. If the candidate succeeds, then union with the divine
and glory supernal will be his; if he fails, then death or madness lies in
store. Far better that he who fails had never ventured upon these initiations,
for fearful indeed are the trials. If the inner self has through austerity and
utterly benevolent devotion, discipline, and learning become as gold in the
fire, then swift and sure will be his passage through the lower worlds.
</P>
<P>With the strength and spirituality burning within, the successful candidate
will rise, and in the boat of his own making sail to the spheres superior, where
the passage from mansion to mansion is made with full awareness of heart and
mind. Passing the supreme test, the pupil, now become Master, returns through
the spaces to earth and once again picks up his entranced body. The guardian of
the initiation chamber who has watched with patient and loving care the body of
his disciple, now is filled with joy: the final initiation is complete, his
pupil has not failed.</P>

<H3>The Closing of the Mystery Schools</H3>
<P>Fourteen centuries ago the death knell of the Mysteries in Europe sounded
when the Emperor Justinian, acting on behalf of the petition of the pagan
initiates themselves, closed the Mysteries of the Roman Empire which at that
time comprised Thrace, Macedonia, Crete, Syria, and Egypt. So degenerate had the
rites become, so decadent the spirit of the once sacred gatherings, that the few
remaining pagan initiates refused to accept further candidates. That which had
once been held as beautiful and holy -- the dramatic ritual of the union of the
aspiring soul with the higher self -- now became orgies of the most degraded
sort.
</P>
<P>Never, never in the history of occultism, past, present, or future, can it
be said that the Mysteries -- <EM>in their purity and spiritual integrity</EM>
-- cater to one's personal and emotional side. It is precisely to free the soul
of limitation, to purify the heart of conflict, to discipline the mind from
wandering, that the Mystery training is so severe, for in initiation only
spiritual strength, only diamond caliber can withstand the searching ordeal.
</P>
<P>Birth, growth, maturity, and senescence are the inevitable processes of
nature in all her departments. The old age of a Mystery school need not be a
degenerate senescence, any more than a person's declining years need be marked
with degradation. But as with men the seeds of degeneracy and ambition are too
frequently sown in the heyday of material success. Likewise in the glory and
power of a flourishing Mystery-center, if the trial of spiritual success is not
met with even greater austerity of heart than in days of probation, the venomous
seeds of inner decay take root and grow. Degradation usurps quiescence, and the
school decays. The spirit of the Brotherhood retreats, the rind of ritual
remains.
</P>
<P>The efficient cause, therefore, of the closing of the Mystery schools is the
<EM>inner faithlessness</EM> of the guardians of the temple. Never would the
light die out if the hierophants remained loyal to the archaic principles of the
school, for the Brotherhood watches with the eagle eye of the seer for every
burning light, and when the call is strong and the cry for truth and light
powerful, the Mysteries remain <EM>ipso facto</EM> pure and clean because
freshened perennially from the fount of light, the Great Brotherhood.
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>When the human race, or any branch of it, or even an individual, makes the
spiritual and intellectual appeal in terms so strong, with spiritual energy so
vibrant, with the very fiber of the inner life so to say, it actually operates
with the spiritual magnetism of a Teacher, and the call is heard in the Great
Brotherhood invariably, and an Envoy or Messenger appears in the world as its
representative. The Mysteries have always degenerated because men became
involved more and more in selfishness and the self-seeking ways of the material
world, and lost the inner touch, the inner consciousness of communion with the
spiritual Powers mentioned above. -- <CITE>The Esoteric Tradition</CITE>, p.
1053
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>There are only two paths in occultism: the right-hand path of white magic
and spiritual progress; and the left-hand path of black magic and spiritual
retrogression. No third path of cessation or rest exists. If one goes not
forwards, then one will remain behind in automatic (if not deliberate)
retrogression. The stream of evolutionary progress is forward, towards the light
of spirit and truth. If one does not travel this path, he falls by the wayside;
the caravan moves on, the idler remains below.
</P>
<P>The farther one proceeds on the path of esoteric training, the sharper must
be the line of demarcation between these two paths; yet paradoxically, just
because of the richer development of the disciple, the finer sensitivity to
right and wrong, the greater are the depths sounded as well as the heights
attained. The middle line of wisdom becomes ever more and more elusive as
progress in spiritual things is made. It is not the gross pitfalls of former
lives that the pupil need guard against, but the subtle refinements of Mara, the
&quot;tempter,&quot; who with cruel and insidious measure tries the soul with
relentless insistence. There is an ancient proverb in Eastern occultism which
says that between the &quot;right and the left hand [Magic] there is but a
cobweb thread.&quot; (<CITE>BCW</CITE> 14:106.) He who would remain on the path
must cleave with all the strength and courage of the divine to that luminous
cobweb thread of wisdom.
</P>
<P>One of the most effective weapons of the dark forces is doubt -- doubt of
oneself, doubt of one's aspirations, doubt of one's inherent strength. This is a
natural and inevitable reaction of chelaship, but a highly dangerous state while
it lasts. If not checked with the stern resolve to conquer or die, and to keep
on keeping on <EM>no matter how often one falls or how grave the error</EM>,
then self-pity obtains mastery and the door to a graver peril is opened: doubt
of the teacher, doubt of the school, doubt of the Brotherhood. Here flourishes
the fatal seed of interior disarray, which if not cast out from the heart will
sprout and grow into the weed of infidelity, strangling the candidate with its
rank growth.
</P>
<P>Terrible are the tests of chelaship, and severe have been the warnings to
the over-eager aspirant for adeptship. As KH wrote to Sinnett in 1881:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><EM>those who engage themselves in the occult sciences</EM> . . . &quot;must
either reach the goal or <EM>perish</EM>. Once fairly started on the way to the
great Knowledge, to doubt is to risk insanity; to come to a dead stop is to
fall; to recede is to tumble backward, headlong into an abyss.&quot; -- <CITE>Mahatma
Letters</CITE>, p. 31
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>There were three results of initiation: (a) success and glory illimitable;
(b) failure which meant death; and (c) partial failure which usually meant
madness. (See <CITE>Fundamentals of the Esoteric Philosophy</CITE>, p. 292.) It
is for this latter reason that the Masters and their disciples have repeatedly
warned their pupils against an undue rushing into occultism. Far safer to remain
in the outer courts of the temple of wisdom as earnest and sincere aspirants for
greater knowledge, as learners striving with all the strength of their souls to
practice the age-old rules of the sanctuary: loyalty, duty, and selfless
fidelity to the cause of humanity. If these three are cherished in the heart and
held to through all the trial and heartache of human existence, then the time
will inevitably come when help will be forthcoming, and the aspirant will know
that he has been chosen. Until such time, wiser to live a noble life in the
position karma has ordained than to live an ignoble one because of innate
incapacity to do better in such an exalted state, in places superior to one's
nature.
</P>
<P>Unwise ardor for spiritual discipline, however, is not half so dangerous as
selfish desire for occult training merely for gaining power. It was this aim
that stimulated the rush for occult powers which laid the foundation for
degeneration of the Mystery schools in the early centuries of our era. For
hundreds of years the Mysteries had been slowly losing their sanctity; thousands
had been received into the preliminary degrees not by virtue of inner
development, but for temporal reasons. The rites became perfunctory observances,
and perception of interior worth diminished. Dogma, ritual, and priestcraft
waxed, the spirit of truth and esotericism waned. The few -- and they were too
few indeed -- who had remained faithful to their sacred pledge fled the
precincts of the Mysteries which had become in later Roman times so degenerate
as actually to repel from their chambers those whose hearts sought only
esotericism.
</P>
<P>The light was withdrawn, but so compassionately does the Brotherhood work
that the truths were preserved in symbol and stone, in allegory and mythos. As
H. P. Blavatsky describes this in regard to Egypt:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Her [Egypt's] sacred Scribes and Hierophants became wanderers upon the face
of the earth. Those who had remained in Egypt found themselves obliged for fear
of a profanation of the sacred Mysteries to seek refuge in deserts and
mountains, to form and establish secret societies and brotherhoods -- such as
the Essenes; those who had crossed the oceans to India and even to the
(now-called) New World, bound themselves by solemn oaths to keep silent, and to
preserve secret their Sacred Knowledge and Science; thus these were buried
deeper than ever out of human sight. In Central Asia and on the northern
borderlands of India, the triumphant sword of Aristotle's pupil swept away from
his path of conquest every vestige of a once pure Religion: and its Adepts
receded further and further from that path into the most hidden spots of the
globe. -- <CITE>BCW</CITE> 14:294
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Thus periodically is accomplished the work of the brothers of the shadow,
the destruction of the <EM>outposts </EM>of the Mysteries, but its core and
heart, the great brotherhood of light, remains unscarred by defeat. Never will
the hand of darkness lay its fingers upon the heart of esotericism which beats
as strongly today as it did some 18 million years ago, and will continue to
pulsate in undiminished power till the death of our solar system -- and beyond.
The light of truth is the light of the spiritual sun of our universe. As long as
its rays gleam down into the world of earth, so long will the rays of spirit
warm human hearts. In the words of Master KH to A. O. Hume:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Fear not; . . . our knowledge will not pass away from the sight of man. It
is the &quot;gift of the gods&quot; and the most precious relic of all. The
keepers of the sacred Light did not safely cross so many ages but to find
themselves wrecked on the rocks of modern scepticism. Our pilots are too
experienced sailors to allow us [to] fear any such disaster. We will always find
volunteers to replace the tired sentries, and the world, bad as it is in its
present state of transitory period, can yet furnish us with a few men now and
then. -- <CITE>Mahatma Letters</CITE>, p. 215

<H3>Line of Occult Succession</H3>
<P>The Greeks were adept in the use of imagery to convey profound esoteric
truths, often using the form of sport; or conversely, they would read into the
exercises of the stadium inner significance. One of the most charming instances
of this was their portrayal through the torchbearer race of the mystic line of
succession of great teachers.
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In the torch-race, the torch-bearer ran from post to post. On reaching the
end of his stage he handed the lighted torch which he carried to the one there
waiting, who immediately took up the race and in his turn handed it to the one
waiting for him. This exercise of the arena or stadium was taken by many Greek
and Latin writers as symbolizing the carrying on of Light from age to age, and
as pointing to the spiritual Torch-bearers who pass the Torch of Truth from hand
to hand throughout unending time. -- <CITE>The Esoteric Tradition</CITE>, p.
1071
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This handing on of the light of truth &quot;throughout unending time&quot;
has formed the theme of nearly all Mystery parables. The Greeks also referred to
this spiritual succession as the Golden Chain of Hermes which they believed to
stretch far into the realms of Olympus, to &quot;Father Zeus downwards through a
series or line of spiritual beings and then through certain elect and lofty
human beings to ordinary men.&quot; (<CITE>The Esoteric Tradition</CITE>, pp.
1070-1.)
</P>
<P>Ancient Vedic thought described this mystic succession as the
<EM>guruparampara</EM> -- a Sanskrit compound literally meaning &quot;teacher
beyond beyond.&quot; The word signifies a line of teachers reaching beyond the
beyond, through past, present, and future, whose sublime purpose is ever the
same: the work of spiritualization.
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The ancient Mystery-Schools of every country of the globe and of whatever
epoch in time, have had each one a Succession of Teachers trained and authorized
by their training to teach in their turn; and as long as this transmission of
the light of Truth was a reality in any one country, it was in every sense a
truly spiritual institution. -- <CITE>The Esoteric Tradition</CITE>, p. 1071
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>One of the most outstanding examples of this ancient transmission of
authority is the succession of &quot;living buddhas&quot; of Tibet, which up to
the present &quot;is a real one, but of a somewhat special type, and it is by no
means what Occidental scholars mistake it to be or have frequently misunderstood
it to be.&quot; (<CITE>The Esoteric Tradition</CITE>, p. 1071.)
</P>
<P>Furthermore, in the Eleusinian Mysteries of Greece,
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>hierophants were drawn from one family, the Eumolpidae, living in Athens,
and the torchbearers were drawn from another family, the Lycomidae, living in
Athens; and we have reason to believe that the Mysteries of Samothrace, the seat
of an older rite, and which were, like the Mysteries of Eleusis, a State
function, were also conducted in the same manner by the passing on of the
tradition held sacred and incommunicable to outsiders; and the bond of union
between the initiates of these so-called Mysteries, was considered indissoluble,
impossible of dissolution, for death merely strengthened the tie. -- <CITE>Fundamentals
of the Esoteric Philosophy</CITE>, p. 287
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In Egypt, Persia, as well as Greece, we find this line of succession
manifesting in another form. There were the thirteen or more Zoroasters whose
esoteric contribution to Persia's history was the inspiration of that once
mighty civilization.
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The number of Zoroasters who have appeared from time to time is confusing,
so long as we consider, and wrongly consider, these Zoroasters to be
reimbodiments of one single ego, instead of different egos imbodying what we may
interpret from the occult records as the 'Zoroaster-spirit.' The truth of the
matter is that in the scheme and terminology of Zoroastrianism, every Root-Race
and sub-race, and minor race of the latter, has its own Zoroaster or Zoroasters.
The term Zoroaster means in Zoroastrianism, very much what the term Buddha does
in Buddhism, or Avatara does in Brahmanism. Thus there were great Zoroasters,
and less Zoroasters -- the qualificatory adjective depending upon the work done
by each Zoroaster, and the sphere of things. Hence we can speak of the
Zoroasters as being thirteen in number from one standpoint, or fourteen from
another, or like the Manus in Brahmanism, or like the Buddhas in Buddhism, we
can multiply each of these by seven again, or even fourteen if we take in every
little branchlet race with its guiding Zoroaster-spirit. -- <CITE>Studies in
Occult Philosophy</CITE>, p. 636
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In Egypt Hermes Trismegistus (&quot;Hermes the thrice greatest&quot;) stands
out from the long Hermes line, whose writings and teachings were founded on the
ancient Mystery doctrine. In Greece again, we find the school of Orphic
Mysteries, from whose halls of esoteric instruction came forth many who bore the
name of their Master Orpheus.
</P>
<P>What impelled these pupils to take the names of their teachers? Why did they
sign their names, or give oral instruction, in the name of Orpheus, Hermes, or
Zoroaster? Was it a kind of spiritual plagiarism, or was it rather because of a
compelling gratitude to the teacher who had given them ALL; who had lighted the
flame of esoteric fire in their hearts? Surely the latter, for whatever message
they had of inspiration and light they deemed not theirs, but &quot;his who sent
me&quot; -- &quot;As we have received it from the teacher, thus shall we pass it
on.&quot; This system is distressing to later historians who struggle always to
attach correct labels to things, yet one cannot help but love these old
disciples for that loyalty of the heart which banishes all thought of <EM>individual
</EM>greatness.
</P>
<P>The relationship between disciple and teacher is a most holy, most sacred
bond of spiritual intimacy. Gratitude wells up from the disciple commensurate
with the greatness of his heart: the little of heart feel only resentment when
the warmth of guidance and protection is offered; but the large of heart burn
with the flame of loving and inextinguishable gratitude. The links in this
Golden Chain of Hermes of spiritual succession are joined by gratitude. As each
link is coupled with its brother link, heart is linked with heart, teacher with
pupil, pupil with teacher -- each teacher a pupil to the one above, each pupil a
teacher to the one below -- all chained by unbreakable links of love, fidelity,
and gratitude to the teacher, to the Brotherhood, to the esoteric wisdom:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Like signal-fires of the olden times, which, lighted and extinguished by
turns upon one hill-top after another, conveyed intelligence along a whole
stretch of country, so we see a long line of &quot;wise&quot; men from the
beginning of history down to our own times communicating the word of wisdom to
their direct successors. Passing from seer to seer, the &quot;Word&quot; flashes
out like lightning, and while carrying off the initiator from human sight
forever, brings the new initiate into view. -- <CITE>Isis Unveiled</CITE> 2:571
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This &quot;long line of Wise men&quot; is kept unbroken by two methods: (a)
the actual reincarnations of adepts into the Brotherhood, allowing for
succession of teacher after teacher; and (b) the birth of the initiate out of
the disciple, the fruit of the final initiation (see chs. 8 and 9). In this way
the Brotherhood revitalizes its membership through the physical birth of
hierophants within the walls of the sanctuary; and the spiritual birth of
recruits from the ranks of the Mystery chambers. (See <CITE>The Esoteric
Tradition</CITE>, p. 1070.) The &quot;Passing of the Word&quot; was the final
rite of the solar initiation: without it no transmission of occult authority
could be made from initiator to chela.
</P>
<P>Hence the line of esoteric authority and wisdom advances in serial order
through grade after grade of chelaship to the world teachers; from world
teachers to high mahatmas; from high mahatmas to buddhas; from buddhas to
dhyani-buddhas; from dhyani-buddhas to the spiritual guide and protector of the
planetary chain of earth; from the earth planetary spirit to the heart of the
sun. Truly a line of luminous glory linking the humblest disciple of wisdom
through direct lineal descent to the solar logos itself.</P>
<HR>
<H4><A NAME="chapter12">Chapter 12</A></H4>
<H3>The Mystery Schools of Today</H3>
<P>The Brotherhood of great ones never desert humanity. Underneath and behind
and within, there pulsates the eternal heart of compassion. Withdrawal of the
Mystery schools from public knowledge by no means indicates the withdrawal of
the ancient support of the Masters. Mystery-centers are to be found today all
over the world, writes H. P. Blavatsky, for &quot;the Secret Association is
still alive and as active as ever. . . . still accessible to those 'who know'. .
.&quot; (<CITE>Isis Unveiled</CITE> 2:100.) Guarded with jealous care by their
protectors, the precise location of these schools is undiscoverable except by
the worthy, but a veil of secrecy is not synonymous with nonexistence.
</P>
<P>Does the physical body remain alive and functional if the heart ceases to
pump blood into the circulatory system, if the organs do not receive their vital
flow from the heart? Thus with the spiritual body of the earth, whose heart is
Sambhala, and from whose ventricles flows forth into specified organic centers
the esoteric lifeblood of the Brotherhood. Every Mystery-center is an organic
focus, every human being is a living cell, all owing allegiance in spiritual
things to the central heart. Is it logical to infer that a heart beats in vain?
Is it logical to infer that organs exist apart from the heart? Such conclusions
are against reason or experience.
</P>
<P>Three are the distributions, as it were, of this esoteric lifeflow:
</P>
<P>(1) Through the exoteric and the esoteric Mysteries. The exoteric or Less
Mysteries are now &quot;largely replaced by the different activities of the
Theosophical Movement&quot;; whereas the esoteric or Greater Mysteries, because
of the weight of matter blinding the world-consciousness, are at present far
more carefully hid; though significantly enough, just because of the increased
need for light and truth, they are &quot;perhaps more numerous today than they
have been for thousands of years. . .&quot; (<CITE>Studies in Occult Philosophy</CITE>,
p. 637.) This fact is of far-reaching importance for all seekers after truth.
Once the power and force of the ancient wisdom seizes the citadel of the heart,
one may receive not only genuine spiritual uplift through contact with the
exoteric Mysteries, but greater still, one actually places oneself in direct
line of inspiration from the esoteric Mysteries, the seats or organic centers of
the Brotherhood.
</P>
<P>(2) Through organic foci of national compass. In the circulation of
spiritual things all countries are in magnetic and sympathetic vibration with
Sambhala. Every great country has its esoteric centers, in fact,
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>every single National unit of the globe, has its own secret spiritual
protectors, who as a body form a true esoteric center. We can call these the
Occult Guardians of a people. Thus Britain has hers, Germany has hers, Russia
has hers, likewise so with Switzerland, France, Italy, Spain, Portugal, China,
India, Japan, the United States, Mexico, Canada, Brazil, etc., . . . a little
country like the Netherlands might be the center of a secret Mystery-School
whose ramifications and influence would extend over half of Europe . . . --
<CITE>Studies in Occult Philosophy</CITE>, p. 637
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>These national occult guardians never meddle in political affairs; their
work is spiritual, intellectual, &quot;wholly benevolent, and indeed universal,
and is a silent guide to the intuitive minds of the different races.&quot; (<CITE>Studies
in Occult Philosophy</CITE>, p. 638.)
</P>
<P>(3) The third channel of esoteric work is one of the most fascinating, yet
least recognized: that of preserving the knowledge from age to age.
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>There are actually groups whose sole business is forming occult centers of
Initiation, preparation of students for esoteric work in the world, and for the
safeguarding of priceless treasures, the heirlooms of the human race, treasures
both intellectual and material. -- <CITE>Studies in Occult Philosophy</CITE>,
p. 637
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The generations of seers are not wasteful, nor are the grand systems of
philosophy and religion lost in the darkness of receding ages. All that is of
essential spiritual value is preserved in the secret archives of the planet.
There are
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>scattered throughout the world, a handful of thoughtful and solitary
students, who pass their lives in obscurity, far from the rumors of the world,
studying the great problems of the physical and spiritual universes. They have
their secret records in which are preserved the fruits of the scholastic labors
of the long line of recluses whose successors they are. The knowledge of their
early ancestors, the sages of India, Babylonia, Nineveh, and the imperial
Thebes; the legends and traditions commented upon by the masters of Solon,
Pythagoras, and Plato, in the marble halls of Heliopolis and Sais; traditions
which, in their days, already seemed to hardly glimmer from behind the foggy
curtain of the past; -- all this, and much more, is recorded on indestructible
parchment, and passed with jealous care from one adept to another. -- <CITE>Isis
Unveiled</CITE> 1:557-8
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Someday worthy explorers of spiritual depths will recover the lost keys, and
mystery after mystery will be solved; temples will be unearthed; secrets of the
initiatory chambers revealed; the occult history of the planet and human races
unfolded. When? At the appointed hour, an hour not fixed by whim or fancy, but
brought into being as the third eye now &quot;most carefully hidden and
inaccessible&quot; opens once again in esoteric birth.
</P>
<P>The chief of these hid centers has its home in Sambhala, with branches in
Syria, Mexico, Egypt, the United States, and Europe, each one &quot;subordinate
to the mother-group of the Occult Hierarchy in Sambhala.&quot; (See <CITE>Studies
in Occult Philosophy</CITE>, p. 637.)
</P>
<P>There is a wonderful description given by the Master Morya in
<CITE>The Mahatma Letters</CITE> of a secret retreat in which his brother and
friend KH enters the silence of further initiation. Masters themselves, though
vastly superior to us, are still human beings -- grandly human, but human
nevertheless -- and must undergo further testing, but such initiations are of
supernal character. Of the trial of his co-worker, Master M writes:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Two days later when his [KH's] &quot;retreat&quot; was decided upon in
parting he asked me: &quot;Will you watch over my work, will you see it falls
not into ruins?&quot; [his work for the Theosophical Society] I promised. What
is there I would not have promised him at that hour! At a certain spot not to be
mentioned to outsiders, there is a chasm spanned by a frail bridge of woven
grasses and with a raging torrent beneath. The bravest member of your Alpine
clubs would scarcely dare to venture the passage, for it hangs like a spider's
web and <EM>seems </EM>to be rotten and impassable. Yet it is not; and he who
dares the trial and succeeds -- as he will if it is right that he should be
permitted -- comes into a gorge of surpassing beauty of scenery -- to one of
<EM>our </EM>places and to some of <EM>our</EM> people, of which and whom
there is no note or minute among European geographers. At a stone's throw from
the old Lamasery stands the old tower, within whose bosom have gestated
generations of Bodhisatwas. It is there, where now rests your lifeless friend .
. . -- <CITE>Mahatma Letters</CITE>, p. 219
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>There in the sanctuaries of Tibet are &quot;gestated generations of
Bodhisattvas,&quot; whose esoteric purpose is the illumination of humanity.
Through all the heartache and sorrow of the world, this strong network of occult
vitality flows in unceasing rhythm to and fro along the invisible arteries and
veins of the body spiritual of our earth. So profound is the compassion of the
Brotherhood, so untiring its labor, that not until the heartbeat of every human
being shall pulsate in rhythmic harmony with the heart of Sambhala will they lay
down their work.</P>
