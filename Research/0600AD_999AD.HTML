c650-850&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The alliterative epic poem Beowulf was
composed at least 100 years before the manuscript was written. It was
written in the 8th century. In 1999 Seamus Heaney wrote a new
translation of the old English tale of a Scandinavian warrior who kills
a trio of monsters including Grendel. In the Anglo-Saxon epic Beowulf,
the hero of the Geats people, mortally wounds the monster Grendel--who
has been terrorizing the court of the king of Danes--by tearing off one
of his arms with his bare hands. Based on folk tales known to the
Anglo-Saxons prior to their invasion of England, the work is made up
primarily of pagan myths and legends. The poem is believed to date from
the late seventh or early eighth century and the only surviving text,
now in the British Museum, dates from about 1000 A.D.<br>

governor of Syria, challenged Ali&#8217;s right to rule. Ali prepared for war
but was murdered by an angry former supporter. The followers of Ali
became known as Shiites from the Arabic meaning "the party of Ali."

began the practice of appointing his own son as the next caliph, and so
the Umayyads ruled for the next 90 years. Muslim forces expanded into
North Africa and completely conquered Persia. The Islamic Empire
