&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(WSJ, 1/11/99, p.R55)<br>
1300BCE&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The oldest know shipwreck dates to about this
time, the era of the fall of Troy and reign of King Tut. It was found
off the southern coast of Turkey at Uluburun (Big Nose/Cape) by Dr.
George Bass in 1984. [see 4431BCE]<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(MT, 3/96, p.2)<br>

<br>
c1300-1200BCE&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Moses: Neither can we be certain even
when Moses lived, except that it was obviously before the Jews settled
in Palestine, when they were still wanderers. The general opinion seems
to be that it was at some time within the period of Ramesses and his
son. The father-in-law of Moses was a Midianite. Moses reportedly died
at Mount Nebo. [see 1250]<br>

1300-1200&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;A sprawling Assyrian administrative center
was discovered by Dutch archeologists in 1997 in Rakka, 340 miles north
of Damascus. The site included a 15-foot high 2-story building with 2
bathrooms, 2 toilets and a tiled floor.<br>

1300-1100BCE&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; From the late Shang Dynasty (13th to
the 11th century BCE), a pair of 33-inch-tall ting tripod vessels, will
be part of the traveling exhibit from the National Palace Museum,
Taipei. [see 1600-1100]<br>

the Hittites. He left his mark on a cliff face by the Nahr al Kalb (Dog
River).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(NG, Aug., 1974, p.157)<br>
<br>
1295-1272BCE&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Hittite king Muwatalli II signed a
treaty with Alaksandu, ruler of the Arzawa land known as Wilusa
(northwest Turkey), which became Wilios in Bronze Age Greece and then
slurred to Ilios for Homer&#8217;s Iliad.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(Arch, 5/04, p.40)<br>

19th Dynasty of Egypt.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(R4,1998)<br>
<br>
1292BCE&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;An Egyptian scribe documented that a couple
of construction worker twins went off a beer binge. They left their
wives at home to chase available women and didn't show up for work.
Their brother-in-law was the chief engineer on the job and did not fire
them.<br>

<br>
1290-1279&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The period of the 19th Dynasty under Seti
I, the father of Ramses II.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(NG, 9/98, p.17,19)<br>
<br>
1290-1224&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Ramesses II, Pharaoh of Egypt. (conjectural
date of Sir Alan Gardiner) His colossal statue, removed from Memphis,
now greets the visitor when he leaves Cairo's main railway station.
There are huge statues of Ramesses in the Luxor temple... and most
gigantic of all, the seated colossi at Abu Simbel. He enlarged the
Karnak temple on a scale which makes human beings... look and feel like
ants. The tomb of Queen Nefertari, wife of Ramses II, Pharaoh of the
19th dynasty, was discovered in 1904.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(L.C.-W.P.p.104,113)(V. Sun, 11/3/95, p.A-20)<br>
<br>
1286BCE&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Hittites fought off the invading
Egyptians. This reflected the power gained from trading metals abundant
in Turkey.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(eawc, p.5)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
<br>
1285BCE&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Battle of Kadesh, in the fifth year of his
reign Ramesses moved to meet and destroy the forces of the Hittite
king, Muwatallis, grandson of Suppililiumas. Here some 70,000-100,000
armed men clashed in fury... The battle lasted two days... and was
decisive in that the Hittite advanced no further.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(L.C.-W.P.p.116-119)<br>
<br>
1279BCE&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Jun, Seti I, pharaoh of Egypt, died.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(NG, 9/98, p.22)<br>
<br>
1279-1212BCE&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The recent discovery of a royal burial
site from the reign of Ramses II, who ruled between 1279 and 1212BCE,
was the subject of Kent R. Weeks, an Egyptologist at the American
Museum in Cairo, in a talk 3/24/96 at the Amer. Mus. of Nat. Hist. In
Jun, 1995, Weeks and his team discovered a family mausoleum thought to
be the burial site for the 48 sons of Ramses II.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(Nat. Hist., 3/96, p.76)(SFC, 8/5/96, p.A10)<br>
<br>
1275-1240BCE&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Trojan War is usually dated to this
period.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(Nat. Hist., 4/96, p.49)<br>
<br>
1270BCE&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;At Abu Simbel, Egypt, Ramses II constructed
The Great Temple in his own honor and the Small Temple in honor of his
wife Nefertari. Engulfed by sand over the centuries, the temples lay
hidden until discovered by a Swiss traveler in 1813. The temples are
moved under a 4 year UNESCO project when in 1964 the rising waters
behind the Aswan High Dam threaten to drown them.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(NG, May 1985, R. Caputo, p.591)<br>
<br>
1267-1237&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;King Hattusili III ruled the Hittites. He
wrote a letter to the king of Ahhiyawa (thought to be Mycenaean Greeks)
and mentioned that Wilusa was once a bone of contention.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(Arch, 5/04, p.40)<br>
<br>
1250BCE&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;By this time the Assyrians committed
themselves to conquering the Kassite Empire to the south.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(eawc, p.4)<br>
1250BCE&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Under the directions of Moses, the Israelites
left Egypt and headed for the "promised land."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(eawc, p.5)<br>
1250BCE&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Some scholars believe that the Mycenaeans
waged a successful war with the Trojans of western Asia Minor.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(eawc, p.5)<br>
<br>
1250-1200BCE&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Hebrew people returned to Canaan
from Egypt after wandering for several years in the Sinai desert and
began the conquest of Canaan. The conquest took some hundred years and
after victory they parceled the land of Canaan into tribal territories
under a government known as an amphictyony.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(eawc, p.5)<br>
<br>
1250-1000BCE&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Troy VIIa, another discernible era on
the site of the Trojan War. Evidence shows that Troy V was destroyed by
fire and that Troy VI saw the establishment of an entirely new
principality. An earthquake hit the thriving city of 5-6 thousand
people, but after the crisis, the same people returned and repaired the
city. The renovated Troy VIIa lasted some seventy years and was then
destroyed by a conflagration. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(Nat. Hist., 4/96, p.49-50)<br>
<br>
1225BCE&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Assyrian ruler, Tukulti-Ninurta, captured
Babylon and the region of southern Mesopotamia, but their control did
not last long.<br>

<br>
1225-1175&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Earthquakes during this period toppled some
city-states and centers of trade and scholarship in the Middle East.
Jericho, Jerusalem, Knossos and Troy were all hit.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(SFC,12/9/97, p.A8)(SSFC, 12/17/00, p.A19)<br>
<br>
1213BCE&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Aug, Ramses II, pharaoh of Egypt, died at
about 90 years of age. His rule had lasted 66 years. In 1976 his mummy
was shipped to Paris, where it was treated with radiation and chemicals
for protection against bacteriological damage.<br>

a temple for the worship of fire was built.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(NG, March 1990,V.I. Sarainidi p.62)<br>
c1200BCE&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Ramessu III ascended the throne of Egypt. He
fought back two major attacks from the northern countries. Ramses III
defended his kingdom from foreign invasion in three separate wars,
reorganized Egyptian society into classes based on occupation and built
a funerary temple based on the Ramesseum. Ramses, son of Setnakht
(1200-1198 BCE), founder of the 20th dynasty, reigned for 32 years. He
twice defended Egypt against invasions from Libyan tribes and once from
a coalition of migrants referred to in records as the "Sea Peoples."
The following period of peace and prosperity allowed him to reorganize
Egyptian society as well as complete a funerary temple, palace and town
center in western Thebes patterned after the Ramesseum, the funerary
temple of Ramses II (1304-1237 BCE). Ramses II greatly admired the 19th
dynasty pharaoh. Ramses survived corruption and assassination attempts
in his later years and was succeeded by his son, the crown prince
Ramses IV. &nbsp;<br>

1200BCE&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"Peoples of the sea" arrived to the Lebanese
coast. They came probably from the Aegean. They toppled the Hittites,
destroyed Ugarit on the Syrian coast and swept south to Egypt where
Ramesses III stopped them.<br>

his fifth year, this invasion was accompanied by war galleys from the
northern countries.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(R.M.-P.H.C.p.22)<br>
<br>
1192BCE&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Ramessu III beat back a more formidable
attack. The inscription describing this war was engraved on the second
pylon of the temple of Medinet Habu. The inscription describes how the
northerners were disturbed, and proceeded to move eastward and
southward, swamping in turn the land of the Hittites, Carchemish,
Arvad, Cyprus, Syria, and other places of the same region. The Hittites
and North Syrians had been so crippled by them that Ramessu took the
opportunity to extend the frontier of Egyptian territory northward...
the twofold ravaging of Syria left it weakened and opened the door for
the colonization of its coast-lands by the beaten remnant of the
invading army.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(R.M.-P.H.C.p.23)<br>
<br>
1185BCE&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Hittite empire fell to the "Sea People,"

(conjectural date of Sir Alan Gardiner) The great Battle against the
Sea Peoples was captured in a magnificent picture which Ramesses III
caused to be sculpted on the walls of his great temple at Medinet Habu
in Thebes.<br>

<br>
1115BCE&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Ramessu XII reigned in Egypt, but the real
authority at Thebes was Hrihor, the high priest of Amon, who was
ultimately to usurp the sovereignty and become founder of the
Twenty-first Dynasty. In Lower Egypt, the Tanite noble Nesubenebded, in
Greek Smendes, has control of the Delta.<br>

c1000BCE&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The British Bronze Age site Flag Fen,
estimated to&nbsp; about this time, was accidentally discovered in 1982
by archaeologist Francis Pryor. Flag Fen is the site of some of the
most recent and unusual discoveries of ancient British culture. In 1982
archaeologist Francis Pryor tripped over a piece of wood while walking
along a dyke in the Fenlands near Peterborough. Noticing that the wood
showed signs of deliberate shaping, he poked around in the peaty, wet
soil and soon discovered a series of posts. The wood was set deeper
into the ground than the surface of a nearby Roman road, so Pryor knew

c500-400BCE&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Before the rise of Rome, the Etruscans
had the most powerful nation in ancient Italy. The Etruscans (who
called themselves the Rasenna) inhabited central Italy and greatly
influenced the Romans in terms of language, architecture and even
fashion (evidence points to the toga as an Etruscan invention).
Unfortunately, no Etruscan literary works survive, so most
documentation comes from Greek and Roman literary sources as well as
archaeological evidence. Their military and political power was eroded
over the course of the 5th century BCE with Rome rising as the dominant
power on the peninsula in the 4th century BCE.<br>
