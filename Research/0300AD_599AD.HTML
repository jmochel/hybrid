354&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Augustine (Aurelius
Augustinus, d.430) was born in Tagaste, North Africa (modern Souk
Ahras, Algeria). Augustine of Hippo, Church Father and philosopher,
held that as long as the fetus was "shapeless" homicide laws did not
apply because it had no senses and no soul. "Total abstinence is easier
than perfect moderation." He fused the New Testament with Greek
philosophy. "Nothing is so powerful in drawing the spirit of a man
downwards as the caresses of a woman."<br>

soon after bishop of Hippo, a Roman city in what is now Algeria. He
wrote "The City of God," in which he laid out a plan of world history,
showing how two cities vied with each other for dominance and would
continue to do so until the end of time. One city was human- material,
fleshly, downward-turning. The other city was divine- spiritual,
turning upward toward the Creator of all things... An individual
thinking being, Augustine said, does not make the truth, he finds it.
He discovers it within himself as he listens to the teachings of the
magister interiore, the "inward teacher," who is Christ, the revealing
Word of God. According to Augustine, St. Ambrose set the fashion for
silent reading and marveled at the innovation.<br>

c500&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Ridgeway, the oldest road
in Europe, wanders along empty, open ridges over Wiltshire&#8217;s
Marlborough Downs in England. Fifteen centuries ago invading Saxons
gave this ancient track its present name, `The Ridgeway`, but even then
it was old beyond all memory. Fifty centuries earlier, Stone Age
traders probably followed this track to barter stone axe heads with
farmer folk in the valleys. These Neolithic merchants picked up The
Ridgeway at the Thames River ford at Goring, then followed it westward
and southward along the crest of the Downs, into what would become the
counties of Berkshire and Wiltshire in the times of the Wessex kings.
Since those first Neolithic peddlers, 200 generations have found their
own good reasons to tramp along the Ridgeway track.<br>

Protection of the Kaaba was organized by the Quraysh tribe, who

a fee. During four months of each year the Quraysh forbade fighting and
raiding along the trade routes and this allowed both merchants and
travelers make their pilgrimages in peace for a fee.<br>

Italian kingdom. For the first time since 476, when the Germanic king,
Odoacer, had deposed the last Western Roman emperor and crowned himself
"King of the Romans," the city of Rome was once more part of the Roman
empire&#8212;albeit an empire whose capital had shifted east to
Constantinople. Belisarius had taken the city back as part of Emperor
Justinian&#8217;s grand plan to recover the western provinces from their
barbarian rulers. The plan was meant to be carried out with an almost
ridiculously small expeditionary force. The 5,000 soldiers that General
Belisarius led included Hunnish and Moorish auxiliaries, and they were
expected to defend circuit walls 12 miles in diameter against an enemy
who would soon be back, and who would outnumber them at least 10-to-1.<br>
