<hr width="100%">BeforeBigBang&nbsp; In a vacuum state with no space or
time, physical laws would not seem appropriate. However, the law that
states
matter can neither be created nor destroyed implies another state here,
i.e. a state of pure energy unbound by space and time. The chance
fluctuation
indicated below for the beginning of the Big Bang would have occurred
in
this energy field. This occurrence could have been like the breaking of
a dam, or a puncture that explodes a filled tire, or a bomb that
violently
explodes upon detonation. The resulting tiny bubble of space-time
provided
an outlet for the enormous energy latent in the pre-space-time state.
This
of course gives no account of how or where or why the initial
pure-energy
state came about. We may never know, but we can always speculate.

<hr width="100%">0000&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;While in a
vacuum state a
chance fluctuation occurred in the void owing to quantum uncertainty.
This yielded an infinitesimal bit of space-time that ballooned in size
1050 times in a quadrillionth of a quadrillionth of a second. Before it
could revert back to nothing, a sort of negative pressure caused a
runaway expansion faster than the speed of light. This is described in
the 1997 book: "The Inflationary Universe" by Alan H. Guth.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(WSJ, 6/17/97, p.A16)(WSJ, 4/11/03, p.B1)<br>
<br>
BIG BANG&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Time, space, matter and energy came into
being. Matter and energy began to define space and time. In 2002
scientists said experiments confirmed that only 5% of the universe was
composed of ordinary matter. 65% was said to be "dark energy" and 30%
was "dark matter." In 1998 Joseph authored &#8220;The Big Bang.&#8221; A 3rd ed.
was published in 2004. In 2004 Simon Singh authored &#8220;Big Bang: The Most
Important Scientific Discovery of All Time and Why You Need to Know
About It.&#8221;<br>

<br>
10 -43&nbsp; Sec.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Theorists think that before gravity
separated out at this moment, that the strong and weak nuclear forces,
and the electromagnetic force were unified.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(NG, May 1985, J. Boslough, p. 652)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Planck time. On time scales shorter than this, the
effects of gravity must be included in all physical processes. In this
time light can travel 3 x 10-32 cm--less than a quadrillionth of the
distance across a proton.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(JST-TMC,1983, p.197,227)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
10 -43 - 10 -35 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;We will call the period beginning at
10-43 second and ending at 10-35 second after the Big Bang the GUT, or
grand unified theory era. This was an era of very high temperatures,
with the energy of collisions ranging from 1019 GeV at the beginning to
1015 GeV at the end. During the GUT era, then, there were only two
kinds of particles: fermions (leptons and quarks, now understood to be
identical) and bosons (the X-particles, gluons, vector mesons, and
photons).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(JST-TMC,1983, p.155)<br>
<br>
10 -36 Sec.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Separation of the Strong Force. Although
atoms do not yet exist, the force that will hold their nuclei together
becomes an individual entity.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(NG, p.12, Jan, 94)<br>
<br>
10-36-10-32 S.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Inflation. Triggered by separation of
the strong force, the universe expands more in this instant than it has
in the roughly 15 billion years since.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(NG, p.12, Jan, 94)<br>
<br>
10 -35 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Sec.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Strong force freezes.
This begins the electroweak era. The interactions between particles are
governed by three (rather than four) fundamental forces--the strong,
electroweak, and gravitational interactions. It is suspected that the
universe inflated very rapidly about this time... the curvature of the
universe increased from 10-23 cm (about 10 billion times smaller than
the size of a single proton) to something around 10 cm--the size of a
grapefruit.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(JST-TMC,1983, p.151,157)<br>
&nbsp;<br>
10 -32 - 10-5 S. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Quarks and anti-quarks. As
inflation ended, the still expanding universe now teems with quarks and
anti-quarks that annihilate each other upon contact. But a surplus of
quarks- one per billion pairs- survives. This surplus of quarks will
ultimately combine to form matter.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(NG, p.12, Jan, 94)<br>
<br>
10-32 to 3,000 Years&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Energy domination. Because of
high temperatures, radiant energy generates most of the gravity in the
universe during this period.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(NG, p.12, Jan, 94)<br>
&nbsp;<br>
10 -12&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Sec.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The final two forces
split off. Electromagnetism is carried by photons, the basic unit of
electromagnetic energy. The weak force controls certain forms of
radioactive decay.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(NG, p.12, Jan, 94)<br>
<br>
10 -10&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Sec.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Weak and
electromagnetic forces freeze. This was the beginning of the quark era.
The universe will have cooled off to some 10 quadrillion degrees or so.
Above this temperature, there is enough energy available (&gt;100 GeV)
in interparticle collisions to create vector bosons; below this
temperature there is not sufficient energy to do so.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(JST-TMC,1983, p.151,157)<br>
<br>
10 -5&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Sec.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Quark confinement. As
the universe cools to one trillion K, trios of quarks form protons and
neutrons.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(NG, p.12, Jan, 94)<br>
<br>
10 -3&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Sec.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Quarks freeze into
particles.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; (JST-TMC,1983, p.157)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;According to the Standard Theory, all matter in the
universe is made from different combinations of two types of sub-atomic
particles. Fermions, such as electrons and quarks, are the bricks or
fundamental building blocks of matter. A different type of particle,
called bosons, are the mortar. Bosons are the carriers or forces like
electromagnetism and gravity, which hold the bricks of our universe
together. Peter Higgs postulated around 1970 that the Higgs boson,
usually invisible, create a field through which subatomic particles,
such as quarks and electrons, pass. Experiments in 2001 found that muon
spin modification in a magnetic field varied from that predicted by the
Standard Model. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(LSA, Fall 1995, p.34)(SFC, 11/4/00, p.A14)(SFC,
2/9/01, p.A5)<br>
<br>
3 Minutes&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Up to this time the temperature was so high
and the collisions in the plasma so violent that no nucleus could
cohere. The temperature at 3 minutes was about a billion degrees -- a
little less than a hundred times hotter than the temperature at the
center of the sun. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; (JST-TMC,1983, p.26)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Between the ages of 3 minutes and
500,000 years, the universe consisted of an expanding plasma with no
atoms present. The nuclei in the plasma were protons, deuterons, helium
3, and helium 4. All other nuclei were synthesized in stars after the
formation of galaxies.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(JST-TMC,1983, p.25-26)<br>
<br>
3 Min, 3.5 sec&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Helium was formed following the Big
Bang.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(WSJ, 11/30/00, p.A12)<br>
<br>
3,000 Years &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Matter Domination. With cooling matter
became the primary source of gravity. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(NG, p.12, Jan, 94)<br>
<br>
10,000 Years&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Atoms formed after the big bang.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(NG, May 1985, J. Boslough, p. 650)<br>
<br>
300k PBB&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The universe was composed of vast waves of
radiation with clumpy structures of hydrogen stretched across empty
space. This was supported by data gathered by the "Boomerang" telescope
mission in 1998-1999, which also supported the idea of a flat universe
expanding forever.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(SFC, 4/27/00, p.A7)<br>
300k PBB&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Not until the universe was this old did
light break away from matter and begin to travel freely through our
expanded speck of space. Hydrogen gas condensed and clumped into
contracting clouds that were the seeds for stars.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(NG, p.12, Jan, 94)(SFC, 1/10/98, p.A2)<br>
<br>
500,000 PBB&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Post Big Bang. The universe suddenly
underwent a change that had the effect of lessening the probability
that radiation would collide with matter.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(JST-TMC,1983, p.15)<br>
<br>
1 Million Years PBB&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The present stage of the universe
was ushered in by the "freezing" of the hot plasma into a collection of
atoms less than a million years after the Big Bang. Under the influence
of gravity, the expanding material began to come together in clumps.
The aggregations would eventually form the galaxies.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(JST-TMC,1983, p.24)<br>
<br>
106 - 1014 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Stelliferous or Star-Filled Era.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(LSA, Spg/97, p.30)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;On Apr 20, 1997 an article in the
Astrophysics Journal identified some of the missing matter (dark
matter) of the universe as ionized hydrogen and helium gas spread out
between the galaxies. The atoms were stripped of their electrons early
in the formation of the universe. It was later reported that only 5% of
the universe was made of ordinary matter. Dark matter formed 25% and
dark energy composed 70%.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(SFC, 4/21/97, p.A3)(SFC, 9/23/02, p.A4)<br>
<br>
200 Million PBB&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Galaxy formation. Matter continued to
clump in the areas of concentration and over eons was condensed by
gravity.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(NG, p.12, Jan, 94)(SFC, 2/12/03, p.A4)<br>
<br>
300 Million PBB&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;It took an estimated 300 million
years for the universe to cool and for the first stars to form from
hydrogen and helium.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(AP, 1/7/04)<br>
<br>
500 Million PBB&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Evidence from the Hubble Space
Telescope in 2001 suggested that the peak of star formation came about
this time and has declined ever since.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(SFC, 1/9/02, p.A11)<br>
<br>
750 Million PBB&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In 2004 a team of astrophysicists
said they have detected a tiny galaxy, the farthest known object from
Earth, formed when the universe was just 750 million years old.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(AP, 2/16/04)<br>
<br>
820 Million PBB&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The galaxy listed as RD1 was detected
in Sept. 1997 and estimated to have come into being about this time. It
was estimated to be 12.22 billion light-years distant.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(SFC, 3/13/98, p.A2) <br>
<br>
1 Billion PBB&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Quasars that formed less than a billion
years after the big bang were identified in 2000 under the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey program.<br>

TIME COUNTED BACKWARDS FROM THE PRESENT<br>
<br>
20-8 Billion&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Estimates of the age of the universe are
in this range, but most astronomers believe it all began about 15
billion years ago.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(NG, p.9, Jan, 94)<br>
<br>
13.7 Bil&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Scientists in 2002, using data from the
Hubble Space Telescope, confirmed that the universe began about this
time. Evidence also confirmed that the universe is flat and expanding
and not closing in on itself. In 2003 astronomers used data from the
Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) and concluded that age of
the cosmos to be 13.7 bil years.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(SFC, 4/25/02, p.A2)(SFC, 5/24/02, p.A2)(SFC,
2/12/03, p.A4)<br>
<br>
13.23 Bil&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In 2004 French and Swiss astronomers
detected the most distant galaxy ever observed, 13.23 billion
light-years from Earth.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(WSJ, 3/2/04, p.A1)<br>
<br>
13 Billion&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Astronomers in 1998 estimated the universe
to be about 13 billion years old.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(USAT, 10/9/98, p.10A)<br>
13 Billion&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In 1999 astronomers used the Hubble Space
Telescope to detect a galaxy, dubbed "Sharon." It was the oldest and
most distant object ever detected.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(SFC, 4/15/99, p.A7)<br>
<br>
13 Bil BP&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In 2003 scientists reported that the oldest
planet ever detected is nearly 13 billion years old and more than twice
the size of Jupiter, locked in orbit around a whirling pulsar and a
white dwarf located near the heart of a globular star cluster some
5,600 light-years from Earth in the constellation Scorpius.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(AP, 7/11/03)<br>
<br>
12.1-12.2 Bil&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Reionization of the cosmos occurred
when the universe was 6-7% of its current age. This marked the end of
the Dark Age as stars generated high energy photons that split the
hydrogen atoms fogging up the universe.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(NH, 7/02, p.72)<br>
<br>
12 Billion&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Astronomers in 1998 reported sighting
galaxies 12 billion light-years away using the Near Infrared Camera and
Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS) on the Hubble Space Telescope.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(USAT, 10/9/98, p.10A)<br>
12 Billion&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Tentative new results from the European
satellite Hipparcos in 1997 indicated this as the approximate age of
the universe and that the oldest stars were about 11 billion years old.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(SFC, 2/17/97, p.A2)<br>
12 Billion&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;A group of astronomers in 1999 concluded
that the universe was about 12 billion years old based on data from the
Hubble telescope. This group calculated the Hubble constant at 70 km
per sec. Other astronomers still argued for an age from 14 to 18
billion years. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(SFC, 5/26/99, p.A1)(SFC, 5/26/99, p.A1,13)<br>
<br>
12-10 Bil&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Observations by the Hubble telescope
determined that the universe must be at least 10-12 billion years old.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(SFC, 4/24/00, p.A10)<br>
<br>
11 Billion&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In 1996 astronomers using the Hubble space
telescope discovered a galaxy under construction. They say 18 gigantic
star clusters packed within a space just 2 million light years across
and apparently on the verge of forming a brand new galaxy. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(SFC, 9/5/96, p.A3)<br>
<br>
9 Billion&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In 1999 astronomers reported a gamma ray
burster, GRB 990123, near the constellation Bootes that originated
about this time.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(SFC, 3/26/99, p.A2)<br>
<br>
5-4.5 Billion&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The sun is now about 5 billion years
old. A rapidly rotating gas cloud will spin off some of the material at
its equator into a disk. This explains why all planets orbit in roughly
the same plane and direction and why they all move in near circular
orbits around the Sun.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(JST-TMC,1983, p.210)(Nat. Hist., 3/96, p.63)(SFC,
4/22/98, p.A11)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The early sun went through a
stormy period called the T-Tauri phase, when powerful winds and
radiation blew outward. <br>

<br>
4.5 Bil&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The abiogenic theory of
Thomas Gold holds that hydrocarbons were a component of the material
that formed Earth through accretion of solids. In 1999 Gold authored

HISTORY OF EARTH<br>
Time reference is BP, i.e. before the present.<br>
<br>
5.0-4.5 Billion&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;As the earth became molten the
nickel-iron migrated inwards, gravitated to form the core. The lighter
materials, largely silicates, were left behind as outer layers, mantle
and crust. The formation of Earth took between 120 and 290 million
years following the explosion of a nearby supernova.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(DD-EVTT, p.114)(SFC, 11/10/00, p.D7)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The formation of the earth was a
process of accrual where numerous planetesimals crash together and
eventually formed a large enough mass to attract more floating matter
to the hot fireball of earth.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(TMP, KCTS-Video, 1987)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In 1996 it was proposed that the
early Earth may have been covered by a thick atmosphere that was blown
away by storms from the young sun.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The first life forms on Earth
were coacervates that formed from lipid aggregations and hydrophobic
interactions. It was a reducing atmosphere back then but there were
energy sources that put things like coacervates together: solar
radiation, volcanic eruptions, radioactive decay released heat,
lightning storms, etc. The coacervate was the first step to cellular
organization!!! Prokaryotes were then able to form after coacervates
and from then on came cyanobacteria. Cyanobacteria increased the levels
of Oxygen in the atmosphere from 1% to 21% which formed ozone. Ozone
then filtered uv light which allowed all life forms to then come on
land instead of living in the ocean. Eukaryotes like us were then able
to evolve!!<br>

housing of calcium carbonate 10-20 cm. high. These creatures grew
together in clusters that were quite like mats or thickets of small
corals in California, Newfoundland, Australia and Russia.<br>

535-520 Mil&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In 1997 scientists proposed that the
Earth underwent a continental flip during this period. Concentrated
land mass near the poles lead to an imbalance that resulted in a shift
by centrifugal force of excess bulk to the equator. Siberia and
northern Europe were large islands called Baltica. The North American
part of Laurentia went from the south pole to straddle the equator.
Northern Europe slid south. East Africa went from the tropics to the
south pole. The changes took place but the reasons for the change were
still controversial. The process was suspected to have contribute to
the great explosion of bio-diversity known as the "Cambrian explosion."<br>
