The first and foremost was
            the need, as I saw it, for a Role Playing Game that could comfortably model a wide range
            of the science fiction and fanasy works available. Whether attempting to run a campaign
            like that of E.E. Doc Smith's Lensman Series or the swashbuckling Star Wars movies the
            need for a consistent role playing system for all ...</p><p>The second was to produce a game system in which the consistency and clarity of the
            rules would allow the Games Master to react flexibly and smoothly to the ever changing
            requirements of the players without having to lay down abitrary barriers. As part of
            this process the discussion of the rules comes complete with designer's notes. These
            notes discuss why a specific rule has been enacted and what the rationale behind what
            they model.</p><p>The third goal was to produce rules that helped to cut bookkeeping down to reasonable
            levels. There is no way to avoid bookkeeping in a Role Playing Game but I have done my
            best to minimize the amount of bookkeeping necessary.</p><p>I hope that Hybrid will bring you hours of enjoyment and diversion.</p></div><div class="part"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a name="d5e16"></a>Part&nbsp;I.&nbsp;Concepts to basic mechanics</h1></div><div><h2 class="subtitle">Going from the basic idea (Concept) to the basic mechanics (Dice Rolls)</h2></div></div></div><div class="toc"><p><b>Table of Contents</b></p><dl class="toc"><dt><span class="chapter"><a href="#d5e19">1.

                    automatically knows that there is a bar in the room and how many people are in
                    it. In order to determine how much the character has "taken in" their
                    environment the GamesMaster may ask the player to roll a Skill Check called the
                    Perception Roll. It is just a standard percentile dice roll. As a result of the
                    roll the GamesMaster will tell you how much the character takes in and
                    understands. Typically , a character intentionally paying attention to the
                    environment takes about a second to take it in. Players may also ask to make
                    "Passive Perception" rolls to determine what their character is able to take in
                    "in passing" rather then paying attention with intent. </p><p>To determine how quickly the character reacts or takes action there is an
                    Initiative Roll. Initiative is rolled on two six sided dice (2d6) and the roll
                    is modified up or down for the situation and the characters go in order of the
                    roll (2 comes before 3, etc). </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d5e72"></a>Actions</h2></div></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e74"></a>Skill Checks or Skill Rolls</h3></div></div></div><p>Skill Checks are the fundamental concept in Hybrid.

If you roll 00 (a 100) you roll again add
                    the second roll to the first to get our total. </p><p> When percentile dice are rolled and the result is under the success chance,
                    that is a normal success. When the rolled number is significantly lower than the
                    needed roll there is a chance the action may have a greater than normal success.
                    This is called a ``Critical'' success. Table \ref{Table:CriticalSuccess} on page
                    on \index{Critical Success} page~\pageref{Table:CriticalSuccess} describes the
                    rolls needed. </p><p> As an example. If a character needed to roll a 40 or under to hit a target
                    with a rock and they rolled under 1/2 of 40 then they will do 1.25 times the
                    damage they would normally do. </p><p> In the case of very poor rolls there is a chance that the roll may be a
                    critical failure This is caused by rolling 50 above your success chance or
                    rolling above by 1/2 the success chance of the action, whichever is greater. </p><p> So someone with a success chance of 90 needs to roll a 140 or higher to
                    critically miss while someone with a success chance of 120 needs to roll a 180
                    or higher to critically miss. </p><p> To determine the severity of the critical failure roll against the amount
                    missed by as a success chance and compare the result to table \index{Critical
                    Failure} \ref{Table:CriticalFailure} on page~\pageref{Table:CriticalFailure}. </p><p> There are a variety of things that can modify the chance of doing an action
                    successfully. The character can mentally prepare for the action {\em set-up} to
                    increase their chances. The action can be sped up by decreasing the chance of
                    success {\em rushing an action}. Actions can be performed simultaneously {\em
                    floretine}. There are additional modifiers for doing something while moving or

                        gunfighter waiting for someone else to start drawing their weapon is a
                        preset action. Having a preset action allows the character to increase the
                        chance of detecting the triggering action and speeds up the preset action.
                        Holding a preset action can be fatiguing over long periods of time. </p><p> Declaring an action to be preset allows an DF +4 to a perception roll. If

                    roll is made the character is now moving at that lower rate. On his next
                    initiative the character may attempt to accelerate to the target movement. Note
                    that the gain number is the movement rate. If an acceleration roll is failed the
                    end result is that the character drops to the next lowest available movement
                    rate. </p><div class="example"><a name="d5e632"></a><p class="title"><b>Example&nbsp;4.3.&nbsp;Example</b></p><div class="example-contents"><p>Reed Johnson has a movement of Dash 10, Run 5, Jog 2.5, Walk 1.3, Crawl

                    as detailed in the chapter on General Play mechanics. Perception is rolled,
                    initiative is determined and actions are chosen. Determine First Reaction. For
                    each of those reactions in order determine the action or attack, the damage from
                    the attack ( if any), the secondary effects of that damage ( if any). Take a

                        attacker must close to get in range to strike. If the defender is aware of
                        the attack and has a usable initiative the may actively resist the closing
                        action. To do so they must make an skill roll using a weapon to fend the
                        attacker off. Fending does not require a re-roll of initiative, the time
                        taken for the fend (same as block and parry) is simply added to the
                        defender's current initiative.</p><p>A fend is treated as any other attack form and all active defenses can be
                        performed against it. If the fend is successful and the attacker chooses to
                        ignore it the fend does normal damage for the weapon.</p><p>If a character that has closed with their opponent is unarmed they may
                        proceed to grapple, to throw, or to overbear.</p><p>If the defender wishes to simply retreat they may do so. They may do so by
                        rolling to fend off the closing action at a DF +6. Of course, they do end up
                        moving backwards.</p><p>If an attacker has been closed upon they may choose to drop their current
                        weapon and use a shorter one, they may choose to use their current weapon as
                        if it were a club, or they may attempt to retreat.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e655"></a>Did I hit him?</h3></div></div></div><p>The attack has a chance to hit that comes from the SC of the weapon and is

                            or PDF for defense. This is simply an extension to the concept of
                            applying Total Concentration as detailed in the General Play Mechanics

                        best lumped together into one task. There is no reason to ask the character
                        to roll a task roll for each action. But if the character stands the chance
                        of being exposed to someone looking for him then a roll should be made for

                        weapon is fairly different from the Slug Pistol so the character can only
                        apply 1/5 of his expertise in Slug Pistol to using this pistol. So he has an
                        effective rank 2 in the weapon. </p><p>As a rule the following relations apply.</p><div class="table"><a name="d5e1146"></a><p class="title"><b>Table&nbsp;7.3.&nbsp;Typical Skills and their costs</b></p><div class="table-contents"><table summary="Typical Skills and their costs" border="1"><colgroup><col><col><col></colgroup><tbody><tr><td> BasicType </td><td> Cost </td><td> DF </td></tr><tr><td> Lore Skills </td><td> (Mental Discipline, No Assist, No Tools)} </td><td> Cost is 3</td></tr><tr><td> Spoken Language Skills </td><td> (Mental Discipline, No Assist, No Tools)} </td><td> Cost is 3</td></tr><tr><td> Written Language Skills </td><td> (Mental Discipline, No Assist, Simple Tools)} </td><td> Cost is 4</td></tr><tr><td> Unarmed Weapon Skills </td><td> (Physical Discipline, No Assist, No Tools)} </td><td> Cost is 2</td></tr><tr><td> Primitive Weapon Skills </td><td> (Physical Discipline, No Assist, Simple Tools)} </td><td> Cost is 3</td></tr><tr><td> Complex Weapon Skills { </td><td> (Physical Discipline, No Assist, Complex Tools)} </td><td> Cost is 4</td></tr><tr><td> Basic Science Skills </td><td> (Science,No Assist, No Tools)} </td><td> Cost is 7</td></tr><tr><td> Basic Engineering Skills </td><td> l (Engineering,No Assist, Complex Tools)} </td><td> Cost is 7</td></tr><tr><td> Basic Technical Skills </td><td> (Technical, No Assist, Complex Tools)} </td><td> Cost is 6</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><br class="table-break"></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e1190"></a>Unfamiliar Tools</h3></div></div></div><p>If the skill requires the use of tools and the tool that the character is
                        utilizing is unfamiliar, then the action occurs at a DF -2. This usually

                        character normally uses and the current one actual effect how it is used. A

                        with very little depth. A person who has learned a general skill such as
                        Throw Object is able to throw just about anything they can get their hands
                        on ( knives, spoons, rocks, chairs) with a lesser success chance than
                        someone who has a specific skill in throwing a particular object</p><p>In addition, there are skills known as support skills that are solely
                        \index{Skills!Support} designed to increase the success chance when doing
                        one type of action with a skill. Someone who uses their sword to parry
                        weapon attacks may wish to train specifically in parrying with a sword. So
                        they would have a ``Long Sword' skill and a ``Long Sword : Parry''
                        skill.</p><p>General skills only give 1%/rank to the success chance. Specific skills
                        (the SH norm), give 4%/rank. Support Skills add 2%/rank. There is no limit
                        on the number of support skills that may be applied to a single task.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e1198"></a>Filter Skills</h3></div></div></div><p>SThere is a category of skills which affects the use of other skills in an
                        environment different from the one they were learned in. These skills are
                        called filter skills. A Filter skill is any skill that can allow for the
                        full expression of other skills in an environment other than that for which
                        those skills were designed for.</p><p>Typical filter skills include the following: 0-g maneuver, Tech Level
                        Lore, Culture Lore, Mounted Combat, Vehicular Combat skills, Armor Wearing,
                        and Computer operations.</p><p>For situations in which the character is attempting to apply a skill in a
                        environment he is not familiar with and that skill must interact with that
                        environment, then the rank in the filter skill becomes the upper limit on
                        the effective rank of the skill being used.</p><p>As an example, if someone has a mounted combat skill at rank 5, he or she
                        may use their archery skill up to rank 5 without making any rolls against
                        their mounted combat. If the character has a higher archery skill and wants
                        to bring it all to bear on a shot, they must roll against their mounted
                        combat first in order to get the full use of the archery skill.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e1204"></a>Skill Pools</h3></div></div></div><p>

Quite often
                            the character will be using a skill package. A skill package is a
                            collection of related skills that have a bundled at a bargain cost. </p><p> A typical skill package would be :</p><p>Terran Law Enforcement Officer Package, Lore: Terran Law,Culture Lore: Terran LEO, Weapon: Pistol,Weapon: Tonfa,Weapon: Taser,Streetwise,Interrogation,Data Analysis,Computer Ops,Cost: 5</p><p>This package would cost 5 points to get rank 0 in all the listed
                            skills, 10 points to get rank 1 and so on. This compares well to 9
                            points to get rank 0 in all the skills and 18 points to get rank 1 and
                            so on. After character generation, these skills are raised individually
                            just like any other skill according to rules described in the Players

                        adding 2 costs 8 points, and so on. After characters have been generated
                        they advance in their stats according to rules described in the Players

                        character creation ( personal, wealth, status) they may choose to use them
                        to buy Enhancements that will add flavour to the character. </p><p> There are always the base enhancements allowed to the character. The
                        points in the personal pool can be used to buy skills at the generation
                        cost. The points in the personal pool can be used to buy stats at the costs
                        listed in the stat cost tables. </p><p> Enhancements are gains in either background or special abilities that can
                        be paid for with points from one of the pools. There are two main types.
                        There are Character Enhancements and there are Environmental Enhancements. </p><p> Character Enhancements are natural aptitudes that are typically permanent
                        and inherent to the character's makeup. Enhanced hearing or eidetic memory
                        are examples of Character Enhancements. </p><p> Environmental Enhancements are typically advantages that depend on the
                        character to maintain them. Such as inherited wealth and various components
                        of status. </p><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d5e1802"></a>Character Enhancements</h4></div></div></div><p> Character Enhancements have both Depth and Scope to help govern their
                            cost. Depth refers to the numeric advantage given by the enhancemnet in
                            a given area. The scope denotes the number of different areas that the
                            spab may be applicable to. In the case of raising a character statistic
                            the scope refers to the number of other stats affected. </p><p> A character enhancement that involves enhancing a statistic is
                            different from raising the statistic. A raised statistic ends up
                            increasing the SB of the character in that stat. The enhanced stat
                            increases the Rank of the character for any direct rolls against that
                            stat. Thus an Enhanced Stat affects Saving Throws and Concentration

                how the character got to be the way they are. Along the way you choose the
                statistics and skills consistent with that story. I would suggest starting by
                picking the race and the culture and going from there. Once the race and culture are
                picked, then you select history that leads you towards the skills that you want.
                Along the way you determine what skills particular to the culture you picked up as
                well as whatever gifts the character was born with and Any advantages or

                        material goods those points of wealth buy you is completely dependent upon

                        the community. For the most part the effect that the points of Community
                        have is dependent on the culture but can also be impacted by the community
                        chosen. For example a character may choose to buy a higher reputation among

                        example, the character can use the points in wealth for buying skills
                        reflecting the choice of concentrating on skills or career rather than

                    statistics. There are often modifiers for the primary statistics (As well as the
                    other statistics) for a given race. Some races have gifts or abilities as well
                    as other trade-offs. For the most part the human races have no modifiers to
                    their statistics. Once you've picked a race just ask your friendly neighborhood
                    games master for the description of the race and the racial modifiers. Those
                    racial modifiers will be recorded and applied later (see <a class="xref" href="#primary-statistics" title="Primary Statistics">the section called &#8220;Primary Statistics&#8221;</a>). </p><div class="example"><a name="d5e1958"></a><p class="title"><b>Example&nbsp;9.1.&nbsp;Race.</b></p><div class="example-contents"><p>For example, the Hairochan are race that start with bonuses to several

                    step. Culture influences what skills are available to you as well as the kinds
                    of careers you can go into. Each culture comes with a standard set of skills
                    that can be bought as a bundle. For example the character knowns the native
                    language of the culture as well as the common history and lore of the culture.
                    The character knows how to behave appropriate to their social class in the
                    culture. Each culture has standard sets of these templates. These templates are
                    detailed in the cultural description. In addition, each culture may have special
                    gifts, particular advantages or disadvantages as well as particular additions to
                    the Personal Development, Wealth, and Community pools. Some cultures may have
                    only one dominant culture and thus only one cultural template or they may have
                    many subcultures.</p><p>Some races have only one culture while some races can be part of more than one
                    culture. You can pick almost any culture for a given race, you just have to come
                    up with a good story to describe how that character ended up with that race in
                    that culture.</p><div class="example"><a name="d5e1972"></a><p class="title"><b>Example&nbsp;9.2.&nbsp;Culture</b></p><div class="example-contents"><p>The Thenean culture is a seagoing culture. Almost all of their easily

                    careers that they've had along the way. Careers is actually a rather loose time.
                    In this context, living on the street is a career. It is an activity during
                    which you accumulate community, wealth, and skills. This career only applies to
                    the history of the character. </p><div class="example"><a name="d5e1992"></a><p class="title"><b>Example&nbsp;9.4.&nbsp;Typical Career</b></p><div class="example-contents"><p>Put example here</p></div></div><br class="example-break"></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d5e1995"></a>Gifts, Advantages, Limitations, and Trade-offs</h2></div></div></div><p> These are all terms for the various quirks of genetics and experience that
                    give the characters a distinct flavor to match the history of the character. For
                    example a character may have a gift that allows them to use magic or a
                    disadvantage such as they are albino. Each trade-off that gives or costs a
                    certain number of points from each of the pools. For example, a character that
                    is Albino gets 15 additional points that they can apply to the Wealth,
                    Community, or Skill pools In exchange for the disadvantage while playing of
                    being sensitive to light. </p><p>These Gifts and trade-offs are just examples. If you have a great idea for a
                    gift or a trade-off it is the GM's job to negotiate it with you and design
                    it.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Note: GMs Note"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Note]" src="file:/home/jmochel/Oxygen%20XML%20Editor%2017/frameworks/docbook/css/img/note.png"></td><th align="left">GMs Note</th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><p>Character Enhancements have both a Depth and Scope that govern their cost.

                            ability to walk great distances in a short period of time using lines of

                            actions. The character takes no off-hand penalties. Costs 10 Personal
                            Development Points </p><p><b>Eidectic Memory.&nbsp;</b> Exact recall (given successful roll against MST) of events. Adds DF 2

                            calculations. Costs 5 Personal Development points </p><p><b>Enhanced Awareness.&nbsp;</b>Someone with an enhanced awareness in a specific area pays less than

                                    significantly increased Physical Awareness in the area of smell.
                                    For example someone with a PAW of 12 would normally pay 2
                                    personal development points to increase their PAW to a 13.
                                    Someone with a heightened sense of smell could pay 1 point and
                                    they would still have a PAW of 12 but they would have a PAW of

                            Temporokinetics has a cost equal to $ 3/4 $ of the PSI stat or 8 points.
                            So someone with a gift for Temporokinetics would pay 8 points per point
                            of heightened PSI in that area. The heightening of PSI for specific PSI
                            skills such as Teleportation has a cost equal to $ 1/2 $ of the PSI stat
                            or 5 points. So someone with a gift for Teleportation would pay 5 points
                            per point of heightened PSI in that area. </p><p><b>Presence.&nbsp;</b> This enhancement reflects other people's innate awareness of the

                            ignore. It is calculated in just the same way as other enhanced stats.
                            So Enhanced Physical Presence is 2 points per additional effect.
                            Decreased Physical Presence is 2 points per subtracted effect. Enhanced
                            Mental Presence is 2 points per additional effect. Decreased Mental
                            Presence is 2 points per subtracted effect. The decreased presence
                            enhancements are, in effect, stealth enhancements. </p><p> </p></div></div></div><div class="chapter"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a name="d5e2039"></a>Chapter&nbsp;10.&nbsp;Turning this into numbers for the game.</h2></div></div></div><div class="toc"><p><b>Table of Contents</b></p><dl class="toc"><dt><span class="sect1"><a href="#primary-statistics">Primary Statistics</a></span></dt><dt><span class="sect1"><a href="#calculated-statistics">Calculated Statistics</a></span></dt><dt><span class="sect1"><a href="#d5e2437">Other Statistics</a></span></dt><dd><dl><dt><span class="sect2"><a href="#d5e2440">Height (HT)</a></span></dt><dt><span class="sect2"><a href="#d5e2445">Weight (WT)</a></span></dt><dt><span class="sect2"><a href="#d5e2450">Appearence (APP)</a></span></dt></dl></dd><dt><span class="sect1"><a href="#d5e2453">Careers</a></span></dt><dt><span class="sect1"><a href="#d5e2458">Skill Costs</a></span></dt><dt><span class="sect1"><a href="#d5e2461">Skill Ranks</a></span></dt><dt><span class="sect1"><a href="#d5e2464">Statistic Costs</a></span></dt><dt><span class="sect1"><a href="#d5e2467">Skill Packages</a></span></dt><dt><span class="sect1"><a href="#d5e2470">Enhancements and Limitations</a></span></dt><dt><span class="sect1"><a href="#d5e2473">Character Enhancements</a></span></dt><dd><dl><dt><span class="sect2"><a href="#d5e2475">Environmental Enhancements</a></span></dt><dt><span class="sect2"><a href="#d5e2478">Wealth</a></span></dt><dt><span class="sect2"><a href="#d5e2481">Friends,Allies, and Contacts</a></span></dt><dt><span class="sect2"><a href="#d5e2484">Reputation</a></span></dt><dt><span class="sect2"><a href="#d5e2487">Continued Careers</a></span></dt><dt><span class="sect2"><a href="#d5e2490">Variations</a></span></dt></dl></dd></dl></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="primary-statistics"></a>Primary Statistics</h2></div></div></div><p> In generating the statistics of the character the player distributes 125

                    start of play. This is where a majority of a character's skills and history will
                    be developed. The process is fairly simple: the player selects the career they
                    wish to enter and then they roll for the character to gain skills, wealth, and
                    status during each year they are in that career. This means three rolls. One for
                    Personal Development, one for Wealth, and one for status. These three pools :
                    Personal Development, Wealth, and Status are the basis of the final resolution
                    of the character's skills, history, and station. Each of the available paths has
                    its own advantages and disadvantages. Educational careers give one little chance
                    to injure one's self but the possible monetary gains are low. Military careers
                    are dangerous, but the skills gained there may not be available elsewhere. The
                    three pools each have a different basic function. The Personal Development pool
                    serves as the point pool for increasing a PC statistics, skills, or creating
                    special abilities. The Wealth pool contains points to be spent in establishing
                    the character's basic financial state. The Status pool contains points to be
                    spent in gaining all the possible trappings of status: reputation, syncophants,
                    or other recognition. Players do have a limited amount of lateral movement for
                    these points. Each career is delineated by a simple set of numbers combined with
                    a simple description. It has the following format: </p><p> For example, here is a description of a Terran Law Enforcement Officer </p><p> The example careers listed above would usually be fleshed out with additional
                    detail such as a description of rank and status, etc\dots \footnote{An important
                    question is that of when a character is allowed to drop out of military and so
                    on careers.} Buying Skills and Enhancements</p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d5e2458"></a>Skill Costs</h2></div></div></div><p> When characters are first generated they can buy single skills using points
                    from the personal pool. During character generation all skills cost 1 point per
                    rank to purchase. So rank 0 costs 1 point, rank 1 costs 2 points , and so on.
                    After characters have been generated they advance in their skills according to
                    rules described in the Players Guide. In summary single skills cost $ 1 + Rank $
                    in personal development points. </p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d5e2461"></a>Skill Ranks</h2></div></div></div><p> The meaning of skill ranks varies somewhat based on the rarity of the skill
                    and so on but, in general, the skill ranks map to expertise according to table

                    Someone is familiar with the skill if they have tried it enough that the tools
                    and techniques are known even if the character has no real practice with them. A
                    character is at a begginer level of skill if they have used the skills enough to
                    be comfortable with all the basic techniques needed even though they may not be
                    consistent in their execution. A character is at a dedicated amateur level of
                    skill if they are consistent in executing all the basic skills even though they
                    have no real comfort with any of the advanced techniques. A solid workaday
                    craftsman is consistent and accomplished in executing all the basic skills and
                    are familiar with the advanced techniques and tools. A professional is
                    consistent and accomplished in te full range of basic and advanced techniques
                    used in routine application of the skill. An expert is consistent and
                    accomplished in all the basic and advanced techniques used in routine
                    application of the skill as well as being familiar with techniques and tools
                    needed for less common usage of the skill. An master is consistent and
                    accomplished in all the techniques used in most applications of the skill. In
                    addition they are familiar with some esoteric techniques needed for bizarre and
                    unusual applications of a skill. An character at a mystical mastery level
                    accomplished in all the techniques used in almost all known applications of the
                    skill. In addition they have a whole series of special techniques and tools they
                    have developed for themselves. </p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d5e2464"></a>Statistic Costs</h2></div></div></div><p> When characters are first generated they can buy statistics using points from
                    the personal pool. During character generation all stats are raised using the
                    costs from the table ~\ref{Table:StatCosts} on page~\pageref{Table:StatCosts}.
                    So adding 1 point of PST costs 4 points, adding 2 costs 8 points, and so on.
                    After characters have been generated they advance in their stats according to
                    rules described in the Players Guide. \input{tcgen4.tex} </p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d5e2467"></a>Skill Packages</h2></div></div></div><p> What we have discussed up till now has been single skills. Quite often the
                    character will be using a skill package. A skill package is a collection of
                    related skills that have a bundled at a bargain cost. A typical skill package
                    would be : \begin{verbatim} Terran Law Enforcement Officer Package Lore: Terran
                    Law Culture Lore: Terran LEO Weapon: Pistol Weapon: Tonfa Weapon: Taser
                    Streetwise Interrogation Data Analysis Computer Ops Cost: 5 \end{verbatim} This
                    package would cost 5 points to get rank 0 in all the listed skills, 10 points to
                    get rank 1 and so on. This compares well to 9 points to get rank 0 in all the
                    skills and 18 points to get rank 1 and so on. After character generation, these
                    skills are raised individually just like any other skill according to rules
                    described in the Players Guide. </p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d5e2470"></a>Enhancements and Limitations</h2></div></div></div><p> After a character has some points in the three pools associated with
                    character creation ( personal, wealth, status) they may choose to use them to
                    buy Enhancements that will add flavour to the character. There are always the
                    base enhancements allowed to the character. The points in the personal pool can
                    be used to buy skills at the generation cost. The points in the personal pool
                    can be used to buy stats at the costs listed in the stat cost tables.
                    Enhancements are gains in either background or special abilities that can be
                    paid for with points from one of the pools. There are two main types. There are
                    Character Enhancements and there are Environmental Enhancements. Character
                    Enhancements are natural aptitudes that are typically permanent and inherent to
                    the character's makeup. Enhanced hearing or eidetic memory are examples of
                    Character Enhancements. Environmental Enhancements are typically advantages that
                    depend on the character to maintain them. Such as inherited wealth and various
                    components of status. </p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d5e2473"></a>Character Enhancements</h2></div></div></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e2475"></a>Environmental Enhancements</h3></div></div></div><p> Environmental Enhancements have both Depth and Scope to help govern their
                        cost. Scope is the number of people affected by the enhancement.
                        
                        So for determining the cost of a single ( Scope = $ 10^0$ ) friend willing
                        to help you all (Depth = Very High ) the time is simply $ 1 + 20 $. The DF
                        describes how willing the person is to help you. So in the example DF = 12
                        implies +60% to the chance for aid from that person. </p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e2478"></a>Wealth</h3></div></div></div><p> The first and most commonly used is the wealth advantage. This differs
                        from the basic wealth that can be gained by spending the points from the
                        wealth pool in that the gain is approximately one third that of a pure
                        monetary spend, but the gain so obtained is income that will continue to be
                        generated for as long as the PC pays attention to the interests that
                        generate the funds. The larger the income the more work involved in
                        maintaining it. The scale of the income is derived from table
                        ~\ref{Table:EnvironmentalEnhancementScopeCosts}. The amount of freedom from
                        managing that income is given by the table

                        logical step. Each culture comes with a standard set of skills that can be
                        bought as a bundle. For example the character knowns the native language of
                        the culture as well as the common history and lore of the culture. The
                        character knows how to behave appropriate to their social class in the
                        culture. Each culture has standard sets of these templates. These templates
                        are detailed in the cultural description. In addition, each culture may have
                        special gifts, particular advantages or disadvantages as well as particular
                        additions to the Skill, Wealth, and Community pools.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e2934"></a>Trade-offs</h3></div></div></div><p> This a term for the various quirks of genetics and experience that give

                        disadvantage such as they are albino. Each trade-off that gives or costs a
                        certain number of points from each of the pools. For example, a character
                        that is Albino gets 15 additional points that they can apply to the Wealth,
                        Community, or Skill pools In exchange for the disadvantage while playing of

                        Tradeoffs that will add flavour to the character. There are some Tradeoffs

                            = 2$ for each additional point of increase. So someone with a 12 PAW
