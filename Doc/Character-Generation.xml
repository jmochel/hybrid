                <para>The player starts with a set of points for buying statistics and a set of
                    points for buying skills. The two pools are the Stat Pool and the Skill Pool.
                    The player starts with 125 points in teh Stat Pool statistics and 10 points in
                    the Skill Pool. </para>
                <para> With these points the player buys what is needed for the initial character
                    development. This includes the Race, Special Abilities, and Culture of the
                    character. </para>
                <para> Then the player generates the history of the character. The player picks the
                    career path the character will follow and uses the results of that career to put
                    points into the other pools. </para>

                <para>Once the primary statistics have been chosen the race of the character must be
                    selected. The racial template includes modifiers for primary statistics and
                    other statistics as well as any special abilities of the race. The racial
                    template includes Stat modifiers, Special Abilities and Limitations. Some races
                    will have a cost that must be paid from the Personal Development pool.</para>

                        <para>What we have discussed up till now has been single skills. Quite often
                            the character will be using a skill package. A skill package is a
                            collection of related skills that have a bundled at a bargain cost. </para>
                        <para> A typical skill package would be :</para>
                        <example><![CDATA["Terran Law Enforcement Officer Package
        Lore: Terran Law
        Culture Lore: Terran LEO

        Weapon: Taser
        Streetwise
        Interrogation
        Data Analysis
        Computer Ops
        Cost: 5"]]></example>
                        <para>This package would cost 5 points to get rank 0 in all the listed
                            skills, 10 points to get rank 1 and so on. This compares well to 9
                            points to get rank 0 in all the skills and 18 points to get rank 1 and
                            so on. After character generation, these skills are raised individually
                            just like any other skill according to rules described in the Players

                    <para> When characters are first generated they can buy statistics using points
                        from the personal pool. During character generation all stats are raised

                        page~\pageref{Table:StatCosts}. So adding 1 point of PST costs 4 points,
                        adding 2 costs 8 points, and so on. After characters have been generated
                        they advance in their stats according to rules described in the Players

                    <para> After a character has some points in the three pools associated with
                        character creation ( personal, wealth, status) they may choose to use them
                        to buy Enhancements that will add flavour to the character. </para>
                    <para> There are always the base enhancements allowed to the character. The
                        points in the personal pool can be used to buy skills at the generation
                        cost. The points in the personal pool can be used to buy stats at the costs
                        listed in the stat cost tables. </para>
                    <para> Enhancements are gains in either background or special abilities that can
                        be paid for with points from one of the pools. There are two main types.
                        There are Character Enhancements and there are Environmental Enhancements. </para>
                    <para> Character Enhancements are natural aptitudes that are typically permanent
                        and inherent to the character's makeup. Enhanced hearing or eidetic memory
                        are examples of Character Enhancements. </para>
                    <para> Environmental Enhancements are typically advantages that depend on the
                        character to maintain them. Such as inherited wealth and various components
                        of status. </para>
                    <sect3>
                        <title>Character Enhancements</title>
                        <para> Character Enhancements have both Depth and Scope to help govern their
                            cost. Depth refers to the numeric advantage given by the enhancemnet in
                            a given area. The scope denotes the number of different areas that the
                            spab may be applicable to. In the case of raising a character statistic
                            the scope refers to the number of other stats affected. </para>
                        <para> A character enhancement that involves enhancing a statistic is
                            different from raising the statistic. A raised statistic ends up
                            increasing the SB of the character in that stat. The enhanced stat
                            increases the Rank of the character for any direct rolls against that
                            stat. Thus an Enhanced Stat affects Saving Throws and Concentration
                            Checks. </para>

                                        Enhanced Mental Presence is 2 points per additional effect.

                                        This differs from the basic wealth that can be gained by
                                        spending the points from the wealth pool in that the gain is
                                        approximately one third that of a pure monetary spend, but
                                        the gain so obtained is income that will continue to be
                                        generated for as long as the PC pays attention to the
                                        interests that generate the funds. The larger the income the

        <title>Creating the background</title>
        <para>The fun of the character generation process is designing the story that describes how
            the character got to be the way they are. Along the way you choose the statistics and
            skills consistent with that story. I would suggest starting by picking the race and the
            culture and going from there. Once the race and culture are picked, then you select
            history that leads you towards the skills that you want. Along the way you determine
            what skills particular to the culture you picked up as well as whatever gifts the
            character was born with and Any advantages or disadvantages they picked up along the
            way.</para>

        <sect1>
            <title>Personal Development, Community, and Wealth points</title>
            <para>As you create the character there will be several groupings of points that you
                will be adding to or taking away from. Your character starts out with 10 points for
                skills, 10 points for wealth, and 10 points for community. </para>
            <formalpara>
                <title>Wealth</title>
                <para>The points for Wealth are used to pick the amount of money or the amount and
                    quality of materials the character starts with. How much actual money or
                    material goods those points of wealth buy you is completely dependent upon the
                    culture you're coming from.</para>

            <formalpara>
                <title>Community</title>
                <para>The Points of community are used to purchase status or reputation within the
                    community. For the most part the effect that the points of Community have is
                    dependent on the culture but can also be impacted by the community chosen. For
                    example a character may choose to buy a higher reputation among mages rather
                    than having a general reputation. </para>
            </formalpara>
            <sidebar>
                <para>The way that points can be added to and taken away from these pools reflects
                    the kind of choices that the player as a storyteller can make as well as the
                    kinds of choices the character can make while growing up. For example, the
                    character can use the points in wealth for buying skills reflecting the choice
                    of concentrating on skills or career rather than money. In the same way points
                    in skills could be put into your community pool could be a reflection of an
                    intentional attempt to establish yourself with the community</para>

            <title>Selecting a Race</title>
            <para>Choosing the race of the character affects the primary and calculated statistics.
                There are often modifiers for the primary statistics (As well as the other
                statistics) for a given race. Some races have gifts or abilities as well as other
                trade-offs. For the most part the human races have no modifiers to their statistics.
                Once you've picked a race just ask your friendly neighborhood games master for the
                description of the race and the racial modifiers. Those racial modifiers will be
                recorded and applied later (see <xref linkend="primary-statistics"/>). </para>
            <example>
                <title>Race.</title>
                <para>For example, the Hairochan are race that start with bonuses to several
                    physical and mental statistics while starting lower in wealth reflecting the
                    fact that they tend not, as a race, to collect material goods. A Hairochan will
                    have the following modifiers: <simplelist>
                        <member>Wealth -10</member>
                        <member>Mental Strength +2</member>

                <title>Gender</title>
                <para>It is probably right about here that you'll want to pick whether the character
                    is male or female. Females generally do have statistical modifiers. For most
                    races the modifiers are: Physical Strength -2, Physical Endurance +1, Mental
                    Endurance +1</para>
            </sect2>
        </sect1>
        <sect1>
            <title>Selecting a culture.</title>
            <para>Once you have decided on the race, picking the culture is the next logical step.
                Culture influences what skills are available to you as well as the kinds of careers
                you can go into. Each culture comes with a standard set of skills that can be bought
                as a bundle. For example the character knowns the native language of the culture as
                well as the common history and lore of the culture. The character knows how to
                behave appropriate to their social class in the culture. Each culture has standard
                sets of these templates. These templates are detailed in the cultural description.
                In addition, each culture may have special gifts, particular advantages or
                disadvantages as well as particular additions to the Personal Development, Wealth,
                and Community pools. Some cultures may have only one dominant culture and thus only
                one cultural template or they may have many subcultures.</para>
            <para>Some races have only one culture while some races can be part of more than one
                culture. You can pick almost any culture for a given race, you just have to come up
                with a good story to describe how that character ended up with that race in that
                culture.</para>

            <title>Careers and History</title>
            <para>Once characters have established what culture they are in they can pick the
                careers that they've had along the way. Careers is actually a rather loose time. In
                this context, living on the street is a career. It is an activity during which you
                accumulate community, wealth, and skills. This career only applies to the history of
                the character. </para>

                the characters a distinct flavor to match the history of the character. For example
                a character may have a gift that allows them to use magic or a disadvantage such as
                they are albino. Each trade-off that gives or costs a certain number of points from
                each of the pools. For example, a character that is Albino gets 15 additional points
                that they can apply to the Wealth, Community, or Skill pools In exchange for the
                disadvantage while playing of being sensitive to light. </para>
            <para>These Gifts and trade-offs are just examples. If you have a great idea for a gift
                or a trade-off it is the GM's job to negotiate it with you and design it.</para>

                <title>GMs Note</title>
                <para>Character Enhancements have both a Depth and Scope that govern their cost.
                    Depth refers to the numeric advantage given by the enhancement in a given area.
                    The scope denotes the number of different areas that the ability may be applicable
                    to. In the case of raising a character statistic the scope refers to the number
                    of other stats affected.</para>

                            <para>For example someone with a heightened sense of smell would pay one

                                significantly increased Physical Awareness in the area of smell. For
                                example someone with a PAW of 12 would normally pay 2 personal
                                development points to increase their PAW to a 13. Someone with a
                                heightened sense of smell could pay 1 point and they would still
                                have a PAW of 12 but they would have a PAW of 13 in the area of

                    <title>PSI Gift</title>
                    <para> The heightening of PSI for broad categories of PSI skills such as
                        Temporokinetics has a cost equal to $ 3/4 $ of the PSI stat or 8 points. So
                        someone with a gift for Temporokinetics would pay 8 points per point of
                        heightened PSI in that area. The heightening of PSI for specific PSI skills
                        such as Teleportation has a cost equal to $ 1/2 $ of the PSI stat or 5
                        points. So someone with a gift for Teleportation would pay 5 points per

                    <para> This enhancement reflects other people's innate awareness of the
                        character in a given area. A person with a high presence is hard to ignore.
                        It is calculated in just the same way as other enhanced stats. So Enhanced
                        Physical Presence is 2 points per additional effect. Decreased Physical
                        Presence is 2 points per subtracted effect. Enhanced Mental Presence is 2
                        points per additional effect. Decreased Mental Presence is 2 points per
                        subtracted effect. The decreased presence enhancements are, in effect,
                        stealth enhancements. </para>

            <para> With the race, gender, and culture selected all of the primary statistics are
                modified and the calculated statistics can be determined. Like the primary
                statistics, the calculated statistics are evenly broken up into sets of physical and
                mental statistics. The list below describes the statistics and how they are
                calculated. Wherever you see the phrase Racial Modifier, there is probably a mention
                of the racial modifier in the racial description that you would apply here. For most
                of you the easiest thing to do is to use one of the supplied spreadsheets and let it
                do the work.</para>

            <title>Careers</title>
            <para> The next step is determining the career path the character took up until the
                start of play. This is where a majority of a character's skills and history will be
                developed. The process is fairly simple: the player selects the career they wish to
                enter and then they roll for the character to gain skills, wealth, and status during
                each year they are in that career. This means three rolls. One for Personal
                Development, one for Wealth, and one for status. These three pools : Personal
                Development, Wealth, and Status are the basis of the final resolution of the
                character's skills, history, and station. Each of the available paths has its own
                advantages and disadvantages. Educational careers give one little chance to injure
                one's self but the possible monetary gains are low. Military careers are dangerous,
                but the skills gained there may not be available elsewhere. The three pools each
                have a different basic function. The Personal Development pool serves as the point
                pool for increasing a PC statistics, skills, or creating special abilities. The
                Wealth pool contains points to be spent in establishing the character's basic
                financial state. The Status pool contains points to be spent in gaining all the
                possible trappings of status: reputation, syncophants, or other recognition. Players
                do have a limited amount of lateral movement for these points. Each career is
                delineated by a simple set of numbers combined with a simple description. It has the
                following format: </para>

		The DF for a MAW or PAW roll to determine the number of personal points
		the character gained in a roll. A successful roll adds points into the 
		Personal Stat Pool. A failed roll adds nothing and a critical failure 
        usually involves the loss of points from the personal pool.

        roll to determine whether or not the character gained in the material 
        or financial area. A successful roll adds Base Financial Gain 
		to the Wealth Pool. This represents the character's gain in free 
		wealth beyond their means of support. i.e. their savings.

        roll to determine whether or not the character gained in  
        Status. A succesful roll adds 1 to the Status Pool.
		Status is a rather subjective thing but typically, a 
        military career leads to increases in rank and possible minor fame. A 
        increase in status in a shadowy career would lead to the development 
        of a "Rep".  Most careers will have a status table that describes 
        the cost of a specific rank or status gain.

            <title>Skill Costs</title>
            <para> When characters are first generated they can buy single skills using points from
                the personal pool. During character generation all skills cost 1 point per rank to
                purchase. So rank 0 costs 1 point, rank 1 costs 2 points , and so on. After
                characters have been generated they advance in their skills according to rules
                described in the Players Guide. In summary single skills cost $ 1 + Rank $ in
                personal development points. </para>
        </sect1>
        <sect1>
            <title>Skill Ranks</title>
            <para> The meaning of skill ranks varies somewhat based on the rarity of the skill and
                so on but, in general, the skill ranks map to expertise according to table
                ~\ref{Table:SkillRanks} on page~\pageref{Table:SkillRanks}. \include{tskill9}
                Someone is familiar with the skill if they have tried it enough that the tools and
                techniques are known even if the character has no real practice with them. A
                character is at a begginer level of skill if they have used the skills enough to be
                comfortable with all the basic techniques needed even though they may not be
                consistent in their execution. A character is at a dedicated amateur level of skill
                if they are consistent in executing all the basic skills even though they have no
                real comfort with any of the advanced techniques. A solid workaday craftsman is
                consistent and accomplished in executing all the basic skills and are familiar with
                the advanced techniques and tools. A professional is consistent and accomplished in
                te full range of basic and advanced techniques used in routine application of the
                skill. An expert is consistent and accomplished in all the basic and advanced
                techniques used in routine application of the skill as well as being familiar with
                techniques and tools needed for less common usage of the skill. An master is
                consistent and accomplished in all the techniques used in most applications of the
                skill. In addition they are familiar with some esoteric techniques needed for
                bizarre and unusual applications of a skill. An character at a mystical mastery
                level accomplished in all the techniques used in almost all known applications of
                the skill. In addition they have a whole series of special techniques and tools they
                have developed for themselves. </para>

        <sect1>
            <title>Statistic Costs</title>
            <para> When characters are first generated they can buy statistics using points from the
                personal pool. During character generation all stats are raised using the costs from
                the table ~\ref{Table:StatCosts} on page~\pageref{Table:StatCosts}. So adding 1
                point of PST costs 4 points, adding 2 costs 8 points, and so on. After characters
                have been generated they advance in their stats according to rules described in the
                Players Guide. \input{tcgen4.tex} </para>

        <sect1>
            <title>Skill Packages</title>
            <para> What we have discussed up till now has been single skills. Quite often the
                character will be using a skill package. A skill package is a collection of related
                skills that have a bundled at a bargain cost. A typical skill package would be :
                \begin{verbatim} Terran Law Enforcement Officer Package Lore: Terran Law Culture
                Lore: Terran LEO Weapon: Pistol Weapon: Tonfa Weapon: Taser Streetwise Interrogation
                Data Analysis Computer Ops Cost: 5 \end{verbatim} This package would cost 5 points
                to get rank 0 in all the listed skills, 10 points to get rank 1 and so on. This
                compares well to 9 points to get rank 0 in all the skills and 18 points to get rank
                1 and so on. After character generation, these skills are raised individually just
                like any other skill according to rules described in the Players Guide. </para>
        </sect1>
        <sect1>
            <title>Enhancements and Limitations</title>
            <para> After a character has some points in the three pools associated with character
                creation ( personal, wealth, status) they may choose to use them to buy Enhancements
                that will add flavour to the character. There are always the base enhancements
                allowed to the character. The points in the personal pool can be used to buy skills
                at the generation cost. The points in the personal pool can be used to buy stats at
                the costs listed in the stat cost tables. Enhancements are gains in either
                background or special abilities that can be paid for with points from one of the
                pools. There are two main types. There are Character Enhancements and there are
                Environmental Enhancements. Character Enhancements are natural aptitudes that are
                typically permanent and inherent to the character's makeup. Enhanced hearing or
                eidetic memory are examples of Character Enhancements. Environmental Enhancements
                are typically advantages that depend on the character to maintain them. Such as
                inherited wealth and various components of status. </para>

                <para> Environmental Enhancements have both Depth and Scope to help govern their

                    So for determining the cost of a single ( Scope = $ 10^0$ ) friend willing to
                    help you all (Depth = Very High ) the time is simply $ 1 + 20 $. The DF
                    describes how willing the person is to help you. So in the example DF = 12
                    implies +60% to the chance for aid from that person. </para>

                <para> The first and most commonly used is the wealth advantage. This differs from
                    the basic wealth that can be gained by spending the points from the wealth pool
                    in that the gain is approximately one third that of a pure monetary spend, but
                    the gain so obtained is income that will continue to be generated for as long as
                    the PC pays attention to the interests that generate the funds. The larger the
                    income the more work involved in maintaining it. The scale of the income is
                    derived from table ~\ref{Table:EnvironmentalEnhancementScopeCosts}. The amount
                    of freedom from managing that income is given by the table

                Once you've picked a race just ask your friendly neighborhood games master for the
                description of the race and the racial modifiers. <xref linkend="racial-modifiers"/>

            <para> Once you have decided on the race, picking the culture is the next logical step.
                Each culture comes with a standard set of skills that can be bought as a bundle. For
                example the character knowns the native language of the culture as well as the
                common history and lore of the culture. The character knows how to behave
                appropriate to their social class in the culture. Each culture has standard sets of
                these templates. These templates are detailed in the cultural description. In
                addition, each culture may have special gifts, particular advantages or
                disadvantages as well as particular additions to the Skill, Wealth, and Community

                character may have a gift that allows them to use magic or a disadvantage such as
                they are albino. Each trade-off that gives or costs a certain number of points from
                each of the pools. For example, a character that is Albino gets 15 additional points
                that they can apply to the Wealth, Community, or Skill pools In exchange for the
                disadvantage while playing of being sensitive to light. </para>

                <title>Enhanced Statistics</title>
                <para>An enhance statistic is the idea that the Character Has a enhanced statistic
                    in some specialized area such as an enhanced sense of smell or Heightened
                    awareness of demons.. Most of the enhancements that involve heightened stats in
                    specialised areas have a simple cost equal to 1/2 the purchase cost of the
                    stats. So someone with a heightened sense of smell would pay one half the cost
                    of Physical Awareness (PAW) or 1/2 * 4 = 2$ for each additional point of
                    increase. So someone with a 12 PAW could pay 8 points of ersonal Development and
                    get a PAW (for smells) of 16. </para>

                <para> The heightening of NRG for broad categories of PSI skills such as
                    Temporokinetics has a cost equal to 3/4 of the NRG stat or 8 points. So someone
                    with a gift for Temporokinetics would pay 8 points per point of heightened NRG
                    in that area. The heightening of NRG for specific PSI skills such as
                    Teleportation has a cost equal to $ 1/2 $ of the NRG stat or 5 points. So
                    someone with a gift for Teleportation would pay 5 points per point of heightened
                    NRG in that area. </para>

                    warding. Broad categories of Made skills such as Warding has a cost equal to 3/4
                    of the NRG stat or 8 points. So someone with a gift for Warding would pay 8
                    points per point of heightened NRG in that area.</para>

                <title>Presence</title>
                <para> This enhancement reflects other people's innate awareness of the character in
                    a given area. A person with a high presence is hard to ignore. It is calculated
                    in just the same way as other enhanced stats. So Enhanced Physical Presence is 2
                    points per additional effect. Decreased Physical Presence is 2 points per
                    subtracted effect. Enhanced Mental Presence is 2 points per additional effect.
                    Decreased Mental Presence is 2 points per subtracted effect. The decreased
                    presence enhancements are, in effect, stealth enhancements. </para>

                    in that the gain is approximately one third that of a pure monetary spend, but

                    the PC pays attention to the interests that generate the funds. The larger the
                    income the more work involved in maintaining it. The scale of the income is
                    derived from scope table. The amount of freedom from managing that income is
