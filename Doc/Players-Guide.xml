                    <para>We mostly work in "Mythic" or "Storytelling" Time. Time is referred to by
                        the units we are used to, Hours, minutes, and seconds. The GamesMaster (GM)
                        typically tells the players how much time has passed and handles the
                        sequencing and general "fairness". Sometimes, the story being told requires
                        more detailed time keeping, we will slice time up into finer pieces. </para>

                    <para>All tasks that are undertaken in Hybrid are done by performing a Skill
                        Check. A Skill Check is done by figuring out the chance of succeeding at a
                        task (called the "Success Chance" as a percentage (such as 86%) and rolling
                        percentile dice (1-100) against that chance. If the die roll is under the
                        "Success Chance" then the character succeeded at what they are attempting.
                        If not, they failed. There are degrees of success that range from "Oh Wow!"
                        (Critical Success) <indexterm><primary>Critical

                    <para>One Skill Check done by every character is a Perception Roll. How well a
                        character does on a Perception Roll determines how alert a character is and
                        how well they can react to a combat or non-combat situation. </para>
                    <para>Most of the time a situation is self evident to a character. A character
                        automatically knows that there is a bar in the room and how many people are
                        in it. In order to determine how much the character has "taken in" their
                        environment the GamesMaster may ask the player to roll a Skill Check called
                        the Perception Roll. It is just a standard percentile dice roll. As a result
                        of the roll the GamesMaster will tell you how much the character takes in
                        and understands. Typically , a character intentionally paying attention to
                        the environment takes about a second to take it in. Players may also ask to
                        make "Passive Perception" rolls to determine what their character is able to
                        take in "in passing" rather then paying attention with intent. </para>

                    <para> When the players want or need a more finely grained time keeping (like
                        Life or Death battles or activities that are expected to make good theater)
                        we will start keeping track of time using "counts". A count is
                            <emphasis>roughly </emphasis> one tenth of a
                                second.<indexterm><primary>Counts</primary></indexterm>
                    </para>
                    <para>While a count is <emphasis>roughly</emphasis> 1/10th of a second its
                        primary purpose is to keep things from colliding. So while 30 counts may
                        have passed, the GM may ajudge that it was only two seconds in "real" time. </para>
                    <para>To determine how quickly the character reacts or takes action there is an
                        Initiative Roll. Initiative is rolled on two six sided dice (2d6) and the
                        roll is modified up or down for the situation and the characters go in order
                        of the roll (2 comes before 3, etc). </para>

            <title>Skill Checks and Actions</title>
            <para>Skill Checks are the fundamental concept in Hybrid. Because they are used or
                referred to by almost all the other All tasks that are undertaken in Hybrid are done
                by performing a Skill Check. A Skill Check is done by figuring out the chance of
                succeeding at a task (called the "Success Chance" <indexterm><primary>Success
                        Chance</primary></indexterm>) as a percentage (such as 86%) and rolling
                percentile dice <emphasis>(d100)</emphasis> against that chance. If the die roll is
                under the "Success Chance" then the character succeeded at what they are attempting.
                If not, they failed. There are degrees of success that range from "Oh Wow!"
                (Critical Success <indexterm><primary>Critical Success</primary></indexterm>) to "Oh
                No!" (Critical Failure <indexterm><primary>Critical Failure</primary></indexterm>) </para>

                    <para> If there are a series of actions that can be lumped together in a single
                        task the DF for the task is the average of the DFs for all the tasks. </para>
                    <para> Jogging across the street and leaping a small fence are actions that are
                        best lumped together into one task. There is no reason to ask the character
                        to roll a task roll for each action. But if the character stands the chance
                        of being exposed to someone looking for him then a roll should be made for
                        the entire set of actions.</para>
                    <para> There are some common tasks and ways of describing actions that have
                        standard DFs.</para>

                    <para>To determine the cost of raising a skill from one rank to the next rank up
                        find the row in table that has the base cost of the skill. Find the column
                        with your current rank in that skill. The cost in each column to the right
                        is the cost it takes to raise a skill from the current rank. To go up in
                        Weapon:Fist (base cost 2) from rank 0 to rank 1 costs 4 EEPs. To go from

                        applicable to the task being performed the character may choose to use a

                    <para>A typical example would be in using two different types of handguns. The
                        character has rank 10 in Slug Pistol but is using a Stun Weapon. The stun
                        weapon is fairly different from the Slug Pistol so the character can only
                        apply 1/5 of his expertise in Slug Pistol to using this pistol. So he has an
                        effective rank 2 in the weapon. </para>

                    <title>Unfamiliar Tools</title>
                    <para>If the skill requires the use of tools and the tool that the character is
                        utilizing is unfamiliar, then the action occurs at a DF -2. This usually
                        only happens if the differences between the version of the tool the
                        character normally uses and the current one actual effect how it is used. A
                        gun with a different mass than the entity is used to is unfamiliar, whereas
                        a gun of the same model and same manufacturer is not. To eliminate this
                        unfamiliarity modifier requires that the entity familiarize himself with the
                        tool with a DF -3 roll against the SB of the skill with a gain of 1 DF per
                        roll..</para>

                    <title>General Skills</title>
                    <para>Skills that are described as general skills cover a wide range of tasks
                        with very little depth. A person who has learned a general skill such as
                        Throw Object is able to throw just about anything they can get their hands
                        on ( knives, spoons, rocks, chairs) with a lesser success chance than
                        someone who has a specific skill in throwing a particular object</para>
                    <para>In addition, there are skills known as support skills that are solely
                        Skills!Support designed to increase the success chance when doing one type
                        of action with a skill. Someone who uses their sword to parry weapon attacks
                        may wish to train specifically in parrying with a sword. So they would have
                        a ``Long Sword' skill and a ``Long Sword : Parry'' skill.</para>
                    <para>General skills only give 1%/rank to the success chance. Specific skills
                        (the SH norm), give 4%/rank. Support Skills add 2%/rank. There is no limit
                        on the number of support skills that may be applied to a single task.</para>

                    <title>Filter Skills</title>
                    <para>SThere is a category of skills which affects the use of other skills in an
                        environment different from the one they were learned in. These skills are
                        called filter skills. A Filter skill is any skill that can allow for the
                        full expression of other skills in an environment other than that for which
                        those skills were designed for.</para>
                    <para>Typical filter skills include the following: 0-g maneuver, Tech Level
                        Lore, Culture Lore, Mounted Combat, Vehicular Combat skills, Armor Wearing,
                        and Computer operations.</para>
                    <para>For situations in which the character is attempting to apply a skill in a
                        environment he is not familiar with and that skill must interact with that
                        environment, then the rank in the filter skill becomes the upper limit on
                        the effective rank of the skill being used.</para>
                    <para>As an example, if someone has a mounted combat skill at rank 5, he or she
                        may use their archery skill up to rank 5 without making any rolls against
                        their mounted combat. If the character has a higher archery skill and wants
                        to bring it all to bear on a shot, they must roll against their mounted
                        combat first in order to get the full use of the archery skill.</para>

                <para>If something could go unnoticed by the character, such as a suprise attack or
                    something hidden, the player should make a Perception Roll. A perception roll is
                    typically SB = PAW, DF=0, with modifiers for how alert the character is trying
                    to be. A perception roll takes 8 counts. A \ndx{Passive Perception Roll can be
                    made Perception!Passive during any action at 1/4 the success chance of a normal
                    perception roll. A passive perception roll takes no time and takes no modifiers

                <title>Using Energy: Fatigue and Exhaustion</title>
                <para>A character using energy to perform actions draws from two different types of
                    reservoirs: Fatigue and Exhaustion. For physical actions the stats are Physical
                    Fatigue and Physical Exhaustion (PFT and PEX). For mental actions the stats are
                    Mental Fatigue and Mental Exhaustion (MFT and MEX).</para>
                <para>Fatigue is the quick access pool of energy a character can use. Exhaustion is
                    the reserve pool of energy a character can use. </para>
                <para>A character loses fatigue as the result of physical activity or combat. A
                    character that has lost all their fatigue has no modifiers to their actions.
                    Fatigue will come back quickly. For each 10 points of fatigue used the character
                    also loses 1 point of exhaustion.</para>
                <para>A character loses Exhaustion by performing strenous activity or by losing
                    fatigue. There are modifiers for being low in Exhaustion.</para>

                <para> Each character has a statistic named Physical Movement. This is the
                    character's movement in meters/second at a dash. There are a total of five
                    different types of movement that a character may utilize. Each type of movement
                    has its own movement rate which is derived from the character's movement
                    statistic. Ideally the player will have the full range of movements listed on
                    his character's sheet. </para>

                <para>If the movement is being resolved during a time scale of greater than every
                    pulse one can get the distance traveled by simply multiplying the movement of

                        meters. If this seems a bit short, keep in mind that a run is not a full
                        dash. At a full dash Joe would have covered twice the distance and would be
                        slowing down pretty drastically due to losing wind.</para>

                    <para>It is important to remember that the accelleration rules should only be
                        used when the distance travelled by the characters over a {\bf short period

                <para>In dealing with movement on a pulse by pulse scale we need to actually deal
                    with acceleration. The sequence is quite simple. Whatever the final movement
                    rate is that the character intends to use is considered the target movement
                    rate. When the character first starts moving he makes an skill roll in order to
                    start moving at the movement rate just below the target movement rate. Once the
                    roll is made the character is now moving at that lower rate. On his next
                    initiative the character may attempt to accelerate to the target movement. Note
                    that the gain number is the movement rate. If an acceleration roll is failed the
                    end result is that the character drops to the next lowest available movement
                    rate. </para>

                <para>The model of tasks and actions in SH is based on a series of reactions and
                    actions. When a character first enters a scene they determine how much they see
                    and understand of the situation perception roll. Then they determine how quickly
                    they can react initiative roll. The character will react faster when they know
                    what is going on and slower when they don't. If a character is expecting
                    something to happen they can prepare for that occurrence preset reactions and
                    speed up their response</para>
                <para>Once the character has reacted they determine what they will do and then do

                        gunfighter waiting for someone else to start drawing their weapon is a
                        preset action. Having a preset action allows the character to increase the
                        chance of detecting the triggering action and speeds up the preset action.
                        Holding a preset action can be fatiguing over long periods of time. </para>
                    <para> Declaring an action to be preset allows an DF +4 to a perception roll. If
                        the perception roll is successful, the character gets to apply their $ 2
                        \times Speed_{Reaction $. A Preset reaction may only be held for MST in the
                        time scale that the players are working in before a cost of 1 MFT must be

            <section>
                <title>Speeds of Actions</title>
                <para> Most actions have a speed associated with them. All simple actions, unless
                    otherwise noted, have a standard speed of 10 count. </para>
                <para>Actions can be performed faster. Speeding up an action lowers the chance of
                    success. Generally half the time to act means you have half the chance to
                    succeed.</para>
                <para>For each percentage of time units the action is sped up a corresponding
                    percentage is removed the success chance. Thus an action performed in 1/4 the
                    time has 1/4 the success chance.</para>

                <para>Combat normally occurs on a pulse by pulse basis. The process is fairly simple
                    as detailed in the chapter on General Play mechanics. Perception is rolled,
                    initiative is determined and actions are chosen. Determine First Reaction. For
                    each of those reactions in order determine the action or attack, the damage from
                    the attack ( if any), the secondary effects of that damage ( if any). Take a
                    breath. Continue.</para>

                    <para>When attacking someone with a weapon of greater reach than their own an
                        attacker must close to get in range to strike. If the defender is aware of
                        the attack and has a usable initiative the may actively resist the closing
                        action. To do so they must make an skill roll using a weapon to fend the
                        attacker off. Fending does not require a re-roll of initiative, the time
                        taken for the fend (same as block and parry) is simply added to the
                        defender's current initiative.</para>
                    <para>A fend is treated as any other attack form and all active defenses can be
                        performed against it. If the fend is successful and the attacker chooses to
                        ignore it the fend does normal damage for the weapon.</para>
                    <para>If a character that has closed with their opponent is unarmed they may
                        proceed to grapple, to throw, or to overbear.</para>
                    <para>If the defender wishes to simply retreat they may do so. They may do so by
                        rolling to fend off the closing action at a DF +6. Of course, they do end up
                        moving backwards.</para>
                    <para>If an attacker has been closed upon they may choose to drop their current
                        weapon and use a shorter one, they may choose to use their current weapon as
                        if it were a club, or they may attempt to retreat.</para>

                            or PDF for defense. This is simply an extension to the concept of
                            applying Total Concentration as detailed in the General Play Mechanics

                            considered as florentine actions. The character is at a DF +3 when

                            defense then evading but it does require you to pick yourself up

                        <para>Dodging is an extension of the normal defensive technique of getting

                            out of the path of an attack. Dodging takes 5 pulses to start, 10 pulses
                            of movement, and 5 pulses of deceleration. A Dodge leaves the character
                            in the act of a controlled fall. A skilled individual may roll to

                        <para>The act of rolling with the blow involves an attempt to take the

                            requires no time but does require that the defender be aware of the
                            attack and declare that he wishes to roll with the attack. The base roll

                    points for buying skills. The two pools are the Stat Pool and the Skill Pool.
                    The player starts with 125 points in teh Stat Pool statistics and 10 points in
                    the Skill Pool. </para>
                <para> With these points the player buys what is needed for the initial character
                    development. This includes the Race, Special Abilities, and Culture of the
                    character. </para>
                <para> Then the player generates the history of the character. The player picks the
                    career path the character will follow and uses the results of that career to put
                    points into the other pools. </para>

                    zero-gravity environment will have high skills in Movement:0-g and little or no
                    skills in Movement:1-g. </para>

                            points to get rank 0 in all the skills and 18 points to get rank 1 and
                            so on. After character generation, these skills are raised individually

                    <para> After a character has some points in the three pools associated with
                        character creation ( personal, wealth, status) they may choose to use them
                        to buy Enhancements that will add flavour to the character. </para>
                    <para> There are always the base enhancements allowed to the character. The
                        points in the personal pool can be used to buy skills at the generation
                        cost. The points in the personal pool can be used to buy stats at the costs
                        listed in the stat cost tables. </para>
                    <para> Enhancements are gains in either background or special abilities that can
                        be paid for with points from one of the pools. There are two main types.
                        There are Character Enhancements and there are Environmental Enhancements. </para>
                    <para> Character Enhancements are natural aptitudes that are typically permanent
                        and inherent to the character's makeup. Enhanced hearing or eidetic memory
                        are examples of Character Enhancements. </para>
                    <para> Environmental Enhancements are typically advantages that depend on the
                        character to maintain them. Such as inherited wealth and various components
                        of status. </para>
                    <sect3>
                        <title>Character Enhancements</title>
                        <para> Character Enhancements have both Depth and Scope to help govern their
                            cost. Depth refers to the numeric advantage given by the enhancemnet in
                            a given area. The scope denotes the number of different areas that the
                            spab may be applicable to. In the case of raising a character statistic
                            the scope refers to the number of other stats affected. </para>
                        <para> A character enhancement that involves enhancing a statistic is
                            different from raising the statistic. A raised statistic ends up
                            increasing the SB of the character in that stat. The enhanced stat
                            increases the Rank of the character for any direct rolls against that
                            stat. Thus an Enhanced Stat affects Saving Throws and Concentration
                            Checks. </para>

                                    <para> This enhancement reflects other people's innate awareness
                                        of the character in a given area. A person with a high
                                        presence is hard to ignore. It is calculated in just the
                                        same way as other enhanced stats. So Enhanced Physical
                                        Presence is 2 points per additional effect. Decreased
                                        Physical Presence is 2 points per subtracted effect.
                                        Enhanced Mental Presence is 2 points per additional effect.
                                        Decreased Mental Presence is 2 points per subtracted effect.
                                        The decreased presence enhancements are, in effect, saquath

                            components of status. These also have a ongoing impact on how friendly

                                        the gain so obtained is income that will continue to be

            <para>The fun of the character generation process is designing the story that describes
                how the character got to be the way they are. Along the way you choose the
                statistics and skills consistent with that story. I would suggest starting by
                picking the race and the culture and going from there. Once the race and culture are
                picked, then you select history that leads you towards the skills that you want.
                Along the way you determine what skills particular to the culture you picked up as
                well as whatever gifts the character was born with and Any advantages or
                disadvantages they picked up along the way.</para>

                    <para>The Points of community are used to purchase status or reputation within
                        the community. For the most part the effect that the points of Community
                        have is dependent on the culture but can also be impacted by the community
                        chosen. For example a character may choose to buy a higher reputation among
                        mages rather than having a general reputation. </para>

                    <para>The way that points can be added to and taken away from these pools
                        reflects the kind of choices that the player as a storyteller can make as
                        well as the kinds of choices the character can make while growing up. For
                        example, the character can use the points in wealth for buying skills
                        reflecting the choice of concentrating on skills or career rather than
                        money. In the same way points in skills could be put into your community
                        pool could be a reflection of an intentional attempt to establish yourself
                        with the community</para>

                <title>Selecting a Race</title>
                <para>Choosing the race of the character affects the primary and calculated
                    statistics. There are often modifiers for the primary statistics (As well as the
                    other statistics) for a given race. Some races have gifts or abilities as well
                    as other trade-offs. For the most part the human races have no modifiers to
                    their statistics. Once you've picked a race just ask your friendly neighborhood
                    games master for the description of the race and the racial modifiers. Those
                    racial modifiers will be recorded and applied later (see <xref
                        linkend="primary-statistics"/>). </para>

                    <para>For example, the Hairochan are race that start with bonuses to several
                        physical and mental statistics while starting lower in wealth reflecting the
                        fact that they tend not, as a race, to collect material goods. A Hairochan
                        will have the following modifiers: <simplelist>
                            <member>Wealth -10</member>

                    <para>It is probably right about here that you'll want to pick whether the
                        character is male or female. Females generally do have statistical
                        modifiers. For most races the modifiers are: Physical Strength -2, Physical
                        Endurance +1, Mental Endurance +1</para>

                <title>Selecting a culture.</title>
                <para>Once you have decided on the race, picking the culture is the next logical
                    step. Culture influences what skills are available to you as well as the kinds
                    of careers you can go into. Each culture comes with a standard set of skills
                    that can be bought as a bundle. For example the character knowns the native
                    language of the culture as well as the common history and lore of the culture.
                    The character knows how to behave appropriate to their social class in the
                    culture. Each culture has standard sets of these templates. These templates are
                    detailed in the cultural description. In addition, each culture may have special
                    gifts, particular advantages or disadvantages as well as particular additions to
                    the Personal Development, Wealth, and Community pools. Some cultures may have
                    only one dominant culture and thus only one cultural template or they may have
                    many subcultures.</para>
                <para>Some races have only one culture while some races can be part of more than one
                    culture. You can pick almost any culture for a given race, you just have to come
                    up with a good story to describe how that character ended up with that race in
                    that culture.</para>

                <title>Careers and History</title>
                <para>Once characters have established what culture they are in they can pick the
                    careers that they've had along the way. Careers is actually a rather loose time.
                    In this context, living on the street is a career. It is an activity during
                    which you accumulate community, wealth, and skills. This career only applies to
                    the history of the character. </para>

                <title>Gifts, Advantages, Limitations, and Trade-offs</title>
                <para> These are all terms for the various quirks of genetics and experience that
                    give the characters a distinct flavor to match the history of the character. For
                    example a character may have a gift that allows them to use magic or a
                    disadvantage such as they are albino. Each trade-off that gives or costs a
                    certain number of points from each of the pools. For example, a character that
                    is Albino gets 15 additional points that they can apply to the Wealth,
                    Community, or Skill pools In exchange for the disadvantage while playing of
                    being sensitive to light. </para>
                <para>These Gifts and trade-offs are just examples. If you have a great idea for a
                    gift or a trade-off it is the GM's job to negotiate it with you and design
                    it.</para>

                    <para>Character Enhancements have both a Depth and Scope that govern their cost.
                        Depth refers to the numeric advantage given by the enhancement in a given
                        area. The scope denotes the number of different areas that the ability may
                        be applicable to. In the case of raising a character statistic the scope
                        refers to the number of other stats affected.</para>

                                <para>For example someone with a heightened sense of smell would pay

                                    significantly increased Physical Awareness in the area of smell.
                                    For example someone with a PAW of 12 would normally pay 2
                                    personal development points to increase their PAW to a 13.
                                    Someone with a heightened sense of smell could pay 1 point and
                                    they would still have a PAW of 12 but they would have a PAW of

                            So someone with a gift for Temporokinetics would pay 8 points per point
                            of heightened PSI in that area. The heightening of PSI for specific PSI
                            skills such as Teleportation has a cost equal to $ 1/2 $ of the PSI stat
                            or 5 points. So someone with a gift for Teleportation would pay 5 points

                            So Enhanced Physical Presence is 2 points per additional effect.
                            Decreased Physical Presence is 2 points per subtracted effect. Enhanced
                            Mental Presence is 2 points per additional effect. Decreased Mental
                            Presence is 2 points per subtracted effect. The decreased presence
                            enhancements are, in effect, saquath enhancements. </para>

                    and mental statistics. The list below describes the statistics and how they are

                    mention of the racial modifier in the racial description that you would apply
                    here. For most of you the easiest thing to do is to use one of the supplied
                    spreadsheets and let it do the work.</para>

                <title>Careers</title>
                <para> The next step is determining the career path the character took up until the
                    start of play. This is where a majority of a character's skills and history will
                    be developed. The process is fairly simple: the player selects the career they
                    wish to enter and then they roll for the character to gain skills, wealth, and
                    status during each year they are in that career. This means three rolls. One for
                    Personal Development, one for Wealth, and one for status. These three pools :
                    Personal Development, Wealth, and Status are the basis of the final resolution
                    of the character's skills, history, and station. Each of the available paths has
                    its own advantages and disadvantages. Educational careers give one little chance
                    to injure one's self but the possible monetary gains are low. Military careers
                    are dangerous, but the skills gained there may not be available elsewhere. The
                    three pools each have a different basic function. The Personal Development pool
                    serves as the point pool for increasing a PC statistics, skills, or creating
                    special abilities. The Wealth pool contains points to be spent in establishing
                    the character's basic financial state. The Status pool contains points to be
                    spent in gaining all the possible trappings of status: reputation, syncophants,
                    or other recognition. Players do have a limited amount of lateral movement for
                    these points. Each career is delineated by a simple set of numbers combined with
                    a simple description. It has the following format: </para>

		The DF for a MAW or PAW roll to determine the number of personal points

		to the Wealth Pool. This represents the character's gain in free

		Status is a rather subjective thing but typically, a 
        military career leads to increases in rank and possible minor fame. A 
        increase in status in a shadowy career would lead to the development 
        of a "Rep".  Most careers will have a status table that describes 
        the cost of a specific rank or status gain.

                <title>Skill Costs</title>
                <para> When characters are first generated they can buy single skills using points
                    from the personal pool. During character generation all skills cost 1 point per
                    rank to purchase. So rank 0 costs 1 point, rank 1 costs 2 points , and so on.
                    After characters have been generated they advance in their skills according to
                    rules described in the Players Guide. In summary single skills cost $ 1 + Rank $
                    in personal development points. </para>

            <sect1>
                <title>Skill Ranks</title>
                <para> The meaning of skill ranks varies somewhat based on the rarity of the skill
                    and so on but, in general, the skill ranks map to expertise according to table
                    ~\ref{Table:SkillRanks} on page~\pageref{Table:SkillRanks}. \include{tskill9}
                    Someone is familiar with the skill if they have tried it enough that the tools
                    and techniques are known even if the character has no real practice with them. A
                    character is at a begginer level of skill if they have used the skills enough to
                    be comfortable with all the basic techniques needed even though they may not be
                    consistent in their execution. A character is at a dedicated amateur level of
                    skill if they are consistent in executing all the basic skills even though they
                    have no real comfort with any of the advanced techniques. A solid workaday
                    craftsman is consistent and accomplished in executing all the basic skills and
                    are familiar with the advanced techniques and tools. A professional is
                    consistent and accomplished in te full range of basic and advanced techniques
                    used in routine application of the skill. An expert is consistent and
                    accomplished in all the basic and advanced techniques used in routine
                    application of the skill as well as being familiar with techniques and tools
                    needed for less common usage of the skill. An master is consistent and
                    accomplished in all the techniques used in most applications of the skill. In
                    addition they are familiar with some esoteric techniques needed for bizarre and
                    unusual applications of a skill. An character at a mystical mastery level
                    accomplished in all the techniques used in almost all known applications of the
                    skill. In addition they have a whole series of special techniques and tools they
                    have developed for themselves. </para>

                <title>Statistic Costs</title>
                <para> When characters are first generated they can buy statistics using points from
                    the personal pool. During character generation all stats are raised using the
                    costs from the table ~\ref{Table:StatCosts} on page~\pageref{Table:StatCosts}.
                    So adding 1 point of PST costs 4 points, adding 2 costs 8 points, and so on.
                    After characters have been generated they advance in their stats according to
                    rules described in the Players Guide. \input{tcgen4.tex} </para>

                <title>Skill Packages</title>
                <para> What we have discussed up till now has been single skills. Quite often the
                    character will be using a skill package. A skill package is a collection of
                    related skills that have a bundled at a bargain cost. A typical skill package
                    would be : \begin{verbatim} Terran Law Enforcement Officer Package Lore: Terran
                    Law Culture Lore: Terran LEO Weapon: Pistol Weapon: Tonfa Weapon: Taser
                    Streetwise Interrogation Data Analysis Computer Ops Cost: 5 \end{verbatim} This
                    package would cost 5 points to get rank 0 in all the listed skills, 10 points to
                    get rank 1 and so on. This compares well to 9 points to get rank 0 in all the
                    skills and 18 points to get rank 1 and so on. After character generation, these
                    skills are raised individually just like any other skill according to rules
                    described in the Players Guide. </para>

            <sect1>
                <title>Enhancements and Limitations</title>
                <para> After a character has some points in the three pools associated with
                    character creation ( personal, wealth, status) they may choose to use them to
                    buy Enhancements that will add flavour to the character. There are always the
                    base enhancements allowed to the character. The points in the personal pool can
                    be used to buy skills at the generation cost. The points in the personal pool
                    can be used to buy stats at the costs listed in the stat cost tables.
                    Enhancements are gains in either background or special abilities that can be
                    paid for with points from one of the pools. There are two main types. There are
                    Character Enhancements and there are Environmental Enhancements. Character
                    Enhancements are natural aptitudes that are typically permanent and inherent to
                    the character's makeup. Enhanced hearing or eidetic memory are examples of
                    Character Enhancements. Environmental Enhancements are typically advantages that
                    depend on the character to maintain them. Such as inherited wealth and various
                    components of status. </para>

                        So for determining the cost of a single ( Scope = $ 10^0$ ) friend willing
                        to help you all (Depth = Very High ) the time is simply $ 1 + 20 $. The DF
                        describes how willing the person is to help you. So in the example DF = 12
                        implies +60% to the chance for aid from that person. </para>

                    <title>Wealth</title>
                    <para> The first and most commonly used is the wealth advantage. This differs
                        from the basic wealth that can be gained by spending the points from the
                        wealth pool in that the gain is approximately one third that of a pure
                        monetary spend, but the gain so obtained is income that will continue to be
                        generated for as long as the PC pays attention to the interests that
                        generate the funds. The larger the income the more work involved in
                        maintaining it. The scale of the income is derived from table
                        ~\ref{Table:EnvironmentalEnhancementScopeCosts}. The amount of freedom from
                        managing that income is given by the table

                    <para>There are often modifiers for the primary statistics (As well as the other
                        statistics) for a given race. Some races have gifts or abilities as well as
                        other trade-offs. For the most part the human races have no modifiers to
                        their statistics. Once you've picked a race just ask your friendly
                        neighborhood games master for the description of the race and the racial
                        modifiers. <xref linkend="racial-modifiers"/> Any of the racial modifiers
                        for primary statistics are applied immediately, any racial modifiers for
                        secondary statistics are applied after those secondary statistics have been
                        calculated. </para>

                    <para> Once you have decided on the race, picking the culture is the next
                        logical step. Each culture comes with a standard set of skills that can be
                        bought as a bundle. For example the character knowns the native language of
                        the culture as well as the common history and lore of the culture. The
                        character knows how to behave appropriate to their social class in the
                        culture. Each culture has standard sets of these templates. These templates
                        are detailed in the cultural description. In addition, each culture may have
                        special gifts, particular advantages or disadvantages as well as particular
                        additions to the Skill, Wealth, and Community pools.</para>

                        the characters a distinct flavor to match the history of the character. For
                        example a character may have a gift that allows them to use magic or a
                        disadvantage such as they are albino. Each trade-off that gives or costs a
                        certain number of points from each of the pools. For example, a character
                        that is Albino gets 15 additional points that they can apply to the Wealth,
                        Community, or Skill pools In exchange for the disadvantage while playing of

                            such as warding. Broad categories of Made skills such as Warding has a
                            cost equal to 3/4 of the NRG stat or 8 points. So someone with a gift
                            for Warding would pay 8 points per point of heightened NRG in that
                            area.</para>

                            ignore. It is calculated in just the same way as other enhanced stats.
                            So Enhanced Physical Presence is 2 points per additional effect.
                            Decreased Physical Presence is 2 points per subtracted effect. Enhanced
                            Mental Presence is 2 points per additional effect. Decreased Mental
                            Presence is 2 points per subtracted effect. The decreased presence
                            enhancements are, in effect, saquath enhancements. </para>

                            from the wealth pool in that the gain is approximately one third that of
                            a pure monetary spend, but the gain so obtained is income that will
                            continue to be generated for as long as the PC pays attention to the
                            interests that generate the funds. The larger the income the more work

                            scope table. The amount of freedom from managing that income is given by
