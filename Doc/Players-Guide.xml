                    <para>We mostly work in "Mythic" or "Storytelling" Time. Time is referred to by
                        the units we are used to, Hours, minutes, and seconds. The GamesMaster (GM)
                        typically tells the players how much time has passed and handles the
                        sequencing and general "fairness". Sometimes, the story being told requires
                        more detailed time keeping, we will slice time up into finer pieces. </para>

                    <para>All tasks that are undertaken in Hybrid are done by performing a Skill
                        Check. A Skill Check is done by figuring out the chance of succeeding at a
                        task (called the "Success Chance" as a percentage (such as 86%) and rolling
                        percentile dice (1-100) against that chance. If the die roll is under the
                        "Success Chance" then the character succeeded at what they are attempting.
                        If not, they failed. There are degrees of success that range from "Oh Wow!"

                    <para>One Skill Check done by every character is a Perception Roll. How well a
                        character does on a Perception Roll determines how alert a character is and
                        how well they can react to a combat or non-combat situation. </para>
                    <para>Most of the time a situation is self evident to a character. A character
                        automatically knows that there is a bar in the room and how many people are
                        in it. In order to determine how much the character has "taken in" their
                        environment the GamesMaster may ask the player to roll a Skill Check called
                        the Perception Roll. It is just a standard percentile dice roll. As a result
                        of the roll the GamesMaster will tell you how much the character takes in
                        and understands. Typically , a character intentionally paying attention to
                        the environment takes about a second to take it in. Players may also ask to
                        make "Passive Perception" rolls to determine what their character is able to
                        take in "in passing" rather then paying attention with intent. </para>

                    <para> When the players want or need a more finely grained time keeping (like
                        Life or Death battles or activities that are expected to make good theater)
                        we will start keeping track of time using "counts". A count is
                            <emphasis>roughly </emphasis> one tenth of a
                                second.<indexterm><primary>Counts</primary></indexterm>
                    </para>
                    <para>While a count is <emphasis>roughly</emphasis> 1/10th of a second its
                        primary purpose is to keep things from colliding. So while 30 counts may
                        have passed, the GM may ajudge that it was only two seconds in "real" time. </para>
                    <para>To determine how quickly the character reacts or takes action there is an
                        Initiative Roll. Initiative is rolled on two six sided dice (2d6) and the
                        roll is modified up or down for the situation and the characters go in order
                        of the roll (2 comes before 3, etc). </para>

            <para>Skill Checks are the fundamental concept in Hybrid. Because they are used or
                referred to by almost all the other All tasks that are undertaken in Hybrid are done
                by performing a Skill Check. A Skill Check is done by figuring out the chance of

                under the "Success Chance" then the character succeeded at what they are attempting.

                        best lumped together into one task. There is no reason to ask the character
                        to roll a task roll for each action. But if the character stands the chance
                        of being exposed to someone looking for him then a roll should be made for
                        the entire set of actions.</para>

                        weapon is fairly different from the Slug Pistol so the character can only
                        apply 1/5 of his expertise in Slug Pistol to using this pistol. So he has an
                        effective rank 2 in the weapon. </para>

                    <title>Unfamiliar Tools</title>
                    <para>If the skill requires the use of tools and the tool that the character is
                        utilizing is unfamiliar, then the action occurs at a DF -2. This usually
                        only happens if the differences between the version of the tool the
                        character normally uses and the current one actual effect how it is used. A

                        unfamiliarity modifier requires that the entity familiarize himself with the
                        tool with a DF -3 roll against the SB of the skill with a gain of 1 DF per

                    <para>Skills that are described as general skills cover a wide range of tasks
                        with very little depth. A person who has learned a general skill such as
                        Throw Object is able to throw just about anything they can get their hands
                        on ( knives, spoons, rocks, chairs) with a lesser success chance than
                        someone who has a specific skill in throwing a particular object</para>
                    <para>In addition, there are skills known as support skills that are solely
                        Skills!Support designed to increase the success chance when doing
                        one type of action with a skill. Someone who uses their sword to parry
                        weapon attacks may wish to train specifically in parrying with a sword. So
                        they would have a ``Long Sword' skill and a ``Long Sword : Parry''

                    <para>General skills only give 1%/rank to the success chance. Specific skills
                        (the SH norm), give 4%/rank. Support Skills add 2%/rank. There is no limit

                    <title>Filter Skills</title>
                    <para>SThere is a category of skills which affects the use of other skills in an
                        environment different from the one they were learned in. These skills are
                        called filter skills. A Filter skill is any skill that can allow for the
                        full expression of other skills in an environment other than that for which
                        those skills were designed for.</para>
                    <para>Typical filter skills include the following: 0-g maneuver, Tech Level
                        Lore, Culture Lore, Mounted Combat, Vehicular Combat skills, Armor Wearing,
                        and Computer operations.</para>
                    <para>For situations in which the character is attempting to apply a skill in a
                        environment he is not familiar with and that skill must interact with that
                        environment, then the rank in the filter skill becomes the upper limit on
                        the effective rank of the skill being used.</para>
                    <para>As an example, if someone has a mounted combat skill at rank 5, he or she
                        may use their archery skill up to rank 5 without making any rolls against

                <para>If something could go unnoticed by the character, such as a suprise attack or
                    something hidden, the player should make a Perception Roll. A perception roll is
                    typically SB = PAW, DF=0, with modifiers for how alert the character is trying
                    to be. A perception roll takes 8 counts. A \ndx{Passive Perception Roll can be
                    made Perception!Passive during any action at 1/4 the success chance of a
                    normal perception roll. A passive perception roll takes no time and takes no
                    modifiers for simultaneous actions.</para>

               <title>Using Energy: Fatigue and Exhaustion</title>
               <para>A character using energy to perform actions draws from two different types of
                   reservoirs: Fatigue and Exhaustion. For physical actions the stats are Physical
                   Fatigue and Physical Exhaustion (PFT and PEX). For mental actions the stats are
                   Mental Fatigue and Mental Exhaustion (MFT and MEX).</para>
               <para>Fatigue is the quick access pool of energy a character can use. Exhaustion is
                   the reserve pool of energy a character can use. </para>
               <para>A character loses fatigue as the result of physical activity or combat. A
                   character that has lost all their fatigue has no modifiers to their actions.
                   Fatigue will come back quickly. For each 10 points of fatigue used the character
                   also loses 1 point of exhaustion.</para>
               <para>A character loses Exhaustion by performing strenous activity or by losing
                   fatigue. There are modifiers for being low in Exhaustion.</para>

                    different types of movement that a character may utilize. Each type of movement
                    has its own movement rate which is derived from the character's movement
                    statistic. Ideally the player will have the full range of movements listed on

                <para>If the movement is being resolved during a time scale of greater than every

                    <para>It is important to remember that the accelleration rules should only be
                        used when the distance travelled by the characters over a {\bf short period

                <para>In dealing with movement on a pulse by pulse scale we need to actually deal
                    with acceleration. The sequence is quite simple. Whatever the final movement
                    rate is that the character intends to use is considered the target movement
                    rate. When the character first starts moving he makes an skill roll in order to
                    start moving at the movement rate just below the target movement rate. Once the
                    roll is made the character is now moving at that lower rate. On his next
                    initiative the character may attempt to accelerate to the target movement. Note
                    that the gain number is the movement rate. If an acceleration roll is failed the
                    end result is that the character drops to the next lowest available movement
                    rate. </para>

                <para>The model of tasks and actions in SH is based on a series of reactions and
                    actions. When a character first enters a scene they determine how much they see
                    and understand of the situation perception roll. Then they determine how quickly
                    they can react initiative roll. The character will react faster when they know
                    what is going on and slower when they don't. If a character is expecting
                    something to happen they can prepare for that occurrence preset reactions and
                    speed up their response</para>

                        gunfighter waiting for someone else to start drawing their weapon is a
                        preset action. Having a preset action allows the character to increase the
                        chance of detecting the triggering action and speeds up the preset action.
                        Holding a preset action can be fatiguing over long periods of time. </para>
                    <para> Declaring an action to be preset allows an DF +4 to a perception roll. If
                        the perception roll is successful, the character gets to apply their $ 2
                        \times Speed_{Reaction $. A Preset reaction may only be held for MST in the
                        time scale that the players are working in before a cost of 1 MFT must be

                    made at this point. The speed of the action is determined and the character

                <title>Speeds of Actions</title>
                <para> Most actions have a speed associated with them. All simple actions, unless
                    otherwise noted, have a standard speed of 10 count. </para>
                <para>Actions can be performed faster. Speeding up an action lowers the chance of
                    success. Generally half the time to act means you have half the chance to
                    succeed.</para>
                <para>For each percentage of time units the action is sped up a corresponding
                    percentage is removed the success chance. Thus an action performed in 1/4 the
                    time has 1/4 the success chance.</para>

                        the attack and has a usable initiative the may actively resist the closing
                        action. To do so they must make an skill roll using a weapon to fend the
                        attacker off. Fending does not require a re-roll of initiative, the time
                        taken for the fend (same as block and parry) is simply added to the
                        defender's current initiative.</para>
                    <para>A fend is treated as any other attack form and all active defenses can be

                        <para>OK, you know you are going to get hit, you have no time for any other
                            defense then to try and roll with the blow and thus avoid being stunned
                            or knocked out.</para>
                        <para>The act of rolling with the blow involves an attempt to take the
                            alloted damage but absorb it in such a way that the normal secondary
                            effects such as stun or knockback do not take effect. The action
                            requires no time but does require that the defender be aware of the
                            attack and declare that he wishes to roll with the attack. The base roll
                            goes against PAG for physical attacks and MAG for mental attacks. It
                            adds DF +5 to the System Shock roll if any is made. The act of rolling
                            with the blow causes a reroll of initiative.</para>
