For those in the In-The-Know group of Karban they can consider this to be 
a official esper corp summary of what can be done with psionics with 
the following alterations: The Esper corp does not acknowledge the existence
of the Mystic skills and they have no certain knowledge of any skill 
levels above medium. High level feats are a matter of unsubstantiated rumor and
master level events are fantasy.

Yvette would be aware of what the Esper corp (Lesk) thinks is real and can 
tailor her report accordingly.

Any comments ? Flames ?
