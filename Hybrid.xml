                <para>One Skill Roll that is done by every character is a Perception roll. How well a character does on a Perception Roll determines how alert a character is and
                    how well they can react to a combat or non-combat situation. </para>
                <para>Most of the time a situation is self evident to a character. A character automatically knows that there is a bar in the room and how many people are in it. In
                    order to determine how much the character has "taken in" their environment the GamesMaster may ask the player to roll a Skill Check called the Perception Roll.
                    It is just a standard percentile dice roll. As a result of the roll the GamesMaster will tell you how much the character takes in and understands. Typically , a
                    character intentionally paying attention to the environment takes about a second to take it in. Players may also ask to make "Passive Perception" rolls to
                    determine what their character is able to take in "in passing" rather then paying attention with intent. </para>

                <title>When do things happen</title>
                <para>Most gaming occurs in "Storytelling" Time. Time is referred to by the units we are used to, hours, minutes, and seconds. The GM typically tells the players
                    how much time has passed and handles the sequencing and general "fairness". Sometimes, the story being told requires more detailed time keeping, we will slice
                    time up into finer pieces.</para>

                <title>How do things happen</title>
                <para>Most actions that a character or non-player character takes in a game are resolved by determining how difficult the action is and rolling percentile dice to
                    determine the success or failure of the action. </para>
                <para> The difficulty of the action is referred to as the <emphasis>Difficulty Factor or (DF) </emphasis> and the chance to succeed is determined from the Success
                    Table below. A Skill Roll is done by figuring out the Difficulty Factor of a task and looking at the row on the table that is under or equal to that Difficulty
                    Factor. The player rolls percentile dice (1-100) and looks at the column to the right and determines the number that the die roll is under. If the die roll is
                    under the number in the "Success" column then the character succeeded at what they attempted. If not, they failed. There are degrees of success that range from
                    "Oh Wow!" (Amazing Success) to "Oh No!" (Amazing Failure). </para>

                    <para>A typical example would be in using two different types of handguns. The character has rank 10 in Slug Pistol but is using a Stun Weapon. The stun weapon
                        is fairly different from the Slug Pistol so the character can only apply 1/5 of his expertise in Slug Pistol to using this pistol. So he has an effective
                        rank 2 in the weapon. </para>

                        different mass than the entity is used to is unfamiliar, whereas a gun of the same model and same manufacturer is not. To eliminate this unfamiliarity
                        modifier requires that the entity familiarize himself with the tool with a DF -3 roll against the SB of the skill with a gain of 1 DF per roll..</para>

                    <para>Skills that are described as general skills cover a wide range of tasks with very little depth. A person who has learned a general skill such as Throw
                        Object is able to throw just about anything they can get their hands on ( knives, spoons, rocks, chairs) with a lesser success chance than someone who has a
                        specific skill in throwing a particular object</para>
                    <para>In addition, there are skills known as support skills that are solely Skills!Support designed to increase the success chance when doing one type of action
                        with a skill. Someone who uses their sword to parry weapon attacks may wish to train specifically in parrying with a sword. So they would have a ``Long
                        Sword' skill and a ``Long Sword : Parry'' skill.</para>
                    <para>General skills only give 1%/rank to the success chance. Specific skills (the SH norm), give 4%/rank. Support Skills add 2%/rank. There is no limit on the

                    <title>Filter Skills</title>
                    <para>SThere is a category of skills which affects the use of other skills in an environment different from the one they were learned in. These skills are
                        called filter skills. A Filter skill is any skill that can allow for the full expression of other skills in an environment other than that for which those
                        skills were designed for.</para>
                    <para>Typical filter skills include the following: 0-g maneuver, Tech Level Lore, Culture Lore, Mounted Combat, Vehicular Combat skills, Armor Wearing, and
                        Computer operations.</para>
                    <para>For situations in which the character is attempting to apply a skill in a environment he is not familiar with and that skill must interact with that
                        environment, then the rank in the filter skill becomes the upper limit on the effective rank of the skill being used.</para>
                    <para>As an example, if someone has a mounted combat skill at rank 5, he or she may use their archery skill up to rank 5 without making any rolls against their
                        mounted combat. If the character has a higher archery skill and wants to bring it all to bear on a shot, they must roll against their mounted combat first
                        in order to get the full use of the archery skill.</para>

                    made Perception!Passive during any action at 1/4 the success chance of a normal perception roll. A passive perception roll takes no time and takes no modifiers
                    for simultaneous actions.</para>

                <title>Using Energy: Fatigue and Exhaustion</title>
                <para>A character using energy to perform actions draws from two different types of reservoirs: Fatigue and Exhaustion. For physical actions the stats are Physical
                    Fatigue and Physical Exhaustion (PFT and PEX). For mental actions the stats are Mental Fatigue and Mental Exhaustion (MFT and MEX).</para>
                <para>Fatigue is the quick access pool of energy a character can use. Exhaustion is the reserve pool of energy a character can use. </para>
                <para>A character loses fatigue as the result of physical activity or combat. A character that has lost all their fatigue has no modifiers to their actions. Fatigue
                    will come back quickly. For each 10 points of fatigue used the character also loses 1 point of exhaustion.</para>
                <para>A character loses Exhaustion by performing strenous activity or by losing fatigue. There are modifiers for being low in Exhaustion.</para>

                    types of movement that a character may utilize. Each type of movement has its own movement rate which is derived from the character's movement statistic.

                <para>If the movement is being resolved during a time scale of greater than every pulse one can get the distance traveled by simply multiplying the movement of the

                        this seems a bit short, keep in mind that a run is not a full dash. At a full dash Joe would have covered twice the distance and would be slowing down
                        pretty drastically due to losing wind.</para>

                </annotation>
                <para>In dealing with movement on a pulse by pulse scale we need to actually deal with acceleration. The sequence is quite simple. Whatever the final movement rate
                    is that the character intends to use is considered the target movement rate. When the character first starts moving he makes an skill roll in order to start
                    moving at the movement rate just below the target movement rate. Once the roll is made the character is now moving at that lower rate. On his next initiative
                    the character may attempt to accelerate to the target movement. Note that the gain number is the movement rate. If an acceleration roll is failed the end result
                    is that the character drops to the next lowest available movement rate. </para>

                        gunfighter waiting for someone else to start drawing their weapon is a preset action. Having a preset action allows the character to increase the chance of
                        detecting the triggering action and speeds up the preset action. Holding a preset action can be fatiguing over long periods of time. </para>
                    <para> Declaring an action to be preset allows an DF +4 to a perception roll. If the perception roll is successful, the character gets to apply their $ 2 \times
                        Speed_{Reaction $. A Preset reaction may only be held for MST in the time scale that the players are working in before a cost of 1 MFT must be expended.

                <para>Actions can be performed faster. Speeding up an action lowers the chance of success. Generally half the time to act means you have half the chance to
                    succeed.</para>
                <para>For each percentage of time units the action is sped up a corresponding percentage is removed the success chance. Thus an action performed in 1/4 the time has

                    <title>Closing to Attack</title>
                    <para>When attacking someone with a weapon of greater reach than their own an attacker must close to get in range to strike. If the defender is aware of the
                        attack and has a usable initiative the may actively resist the closing action. To do so they must make an skill roll using a weapon to fend the attacker
                        off. Fending does not require a re-roll of initiative, the time taken for the fend (same as block and parry) is simply added to the defender's current
                        initiative.</para>
                    <para>A fend is treated as any other attack form and all active defenses can be performed against it. If the fend is successful and the attacker chooses to
                        ignore it the fend does normal damage for the weapon.</para>
                    <para>If a character that has closed with their opponent is unarmed they may proceed to grapple, to throw, or to overbear.</para>
                    <para>If the defender wishes to simply retreat they may do so. They may do so by rolling to fend off the closing action at a DF +6. Of course, they do end up
                        moving backwards.</para>
                    <para>If an attacker has been closed upon they may choose to drop their current weapon and use a shorter one, they may choose to use their current weapon as if
                        it were a club, or they may attempt to retreat.</para>

                        <para>An all out attack means that the character is attacking without any attempt to defend themself. A character may choose to perform an all out attack
                            and thus gain their MDF or PDF to their attacks and lose his MDF or PDF for defense. This is simply an extension to the concept of applying Total

                        <para>When a character has been hit by a something with large amount of kinetic energy they can fall down or lose their balance. This is called Knock-Back.
                            It happens when more than 1/2 of the entities PFT or 1/4 of their PBD is taken away in a single crushing or projectile strike. It can also happen with
                            any explosive attack. The Knockback resistance roll is DF -2. If successful the character is unaffected. If failed the entity has fallen to the ground.
                            The stat basis is typically PST or PAG whichever is greater.</para>

                        <para>Dodging is an extension of the normal defensive technique of getting out of the way. Dodging implies that the PC is actively throwing himself out of
                            the path of an attack. Dodging takes 5 pulses to start, 10 pulses of movement, and 5 pulses of deceleration. A Dodge leaves the character in the act of
                            a controlled fall. A skilled individual may roll to acrobatically recover. A dodging character has <informalequation>

                        <para>The act of rolling with the blow involves an attempt to take the alloted damage but absorb it in such a way that the normal secondary effects such as
                            stun or knockback do not take effect. The action requires no time but does require that the defender be aware of the attack and declare that he wishes
                            to roll with the attack. The base roll goes against PAG for physical attacks and MAG for mental attacks. It adds DF +5 to the System Shock roll if any
                            is made. The act of rolling with the blow causes a reroll of initiative.</para>

                            <para>What we have discussed up till now has been single skills. Quite often the character will be using a skill package. A skill package is a
                                collection of related skills that have a bundled at a bargain cost. </para>
                            <para> A typical skill package would be :</para>
                            <example><![CDATA["Terran Law Enforcement Officer Package
        Lore: Terran Law
        Culture Lore: Terran LEO
        Weapon: Pistol 
        Weapon: Tonfa
        Weapon: Taser
        Streetwise
        Interrogation
        Data Analysis
        Computer Ops
        Cost: 5"]]></example>
                            <para>This package would cost 5 points to get rank 0 in all the listed skills, 10 points to get rank 1 and so on. This compares well to 9 points to get
                                rank 0 in all the skills and 18 points to get rank 1 and so on. After character generation, these skills are raised individually just like any other
                                skill according to rules described in the Players Guide.</para>

                        <para> When characters are first generated they can buy statistics using points from the personal pool. During character generation all stats are raised
                            using the costs from the table ~\ref{Table:StatCosts} on page~\pageref{Table:StatCosts}. So adding 1 point of PST costs 4 points, adding 2 costs 8
                            points, and so on. After characters have been generated they advance in their stats according to rules described in the Players Guide.</para>

                        <para> After a character has some points in the three pools associated with character creation ( personal, wealth, status) they may choose to use them to
                            buy Enhancements that will add flavour to the character. </para>
                        <para> There are always the base enhancements allowed to the character. The points in the personal pool can be used to buy skills at the generation cost.
                            The points in the personal pool can be used to buy stats at the costs listed in the stat cost tables. </para>
                        <para> Enhancements are gains in either background or special abilities that can be paid for with points from one of the pools. There are two main types.
                            There are Character Enhancements and there are Environmental Enhancements. </para>
                        <para> Character Enhancements are natural aptitudes that are typically permanent and inherent to the character's makeup. Enhanced hearing or eidetic memory
                            are examples of Character Enhancements. </para>
                        <para> Environmental Enhancements are typically advantages that depend on the character to maintain them. Such as inherited wealth and various components of
                            status. </para>

                            <para> Character Enhancements have both Depth and Scope to help govern their cost. Depth refers to the numeric advantage given by the enhancemnet in a
                                given area. The scope denotes the number of different areas that the spab may be applicable to. In the case of raising a character statistic the
                                scope refers to the number of other stats affected. </para>
                            <para> A character enhancement that involves enhancing a statistic is different from raising the statistic. A raised statistic ends up increasing the SB
                                of the character in that stat. The enhanced stat increases the Rank of the character for any direct rolls against that stat. Thus an Enhanced Stat
                                affects Saving Throws and Concentration Checks. </para>

                <para>The fun of the character generation process is designing the story that describes how the character got to be the way they are. Along the way you choose the
                    statistics and skills consistent with that story. I would suggest starting by picking the race and the culture and going from there. Once the race and culture
                    are picked, then you select history that leads you towards the skills that you want. Along the way you determine what skills particular to the culture you
                    picked up as well as whatever gifts the character was born with and Any advantages or disadvantages they picked up along the way.</para>

                    <title>Personal Development, Community, and Wealth points</title>
                    <para>As you create the character there will be several groupings of points that you will be adding to or taking away from. Your character starts out with 10
                        points for skills, 10 points for wealth, and 10 points for community. </para>

                        <para>The points for Wealth are used to pick the amount of money or the amount and quality of materials the character starts with. How much actual money or
                            material goods those points of wealth buy you is completely dependent upon the culture you're coming from.</para>

                            is dependent on the culture but can also be impacted by the community chosen. For example a character may choose to buy a higher reputation among mages
                            rather than having a general reputation. </para>

                        <para>The way that points can be added to and taken away from these pools reflects the kind of choices that the player as a storyteller can make as well as
                            the kinds of choices the character can make while growing up. For example, the character can use the points in wealth for buying skills reflecting the
                            choice of concentrating on skills or career rather than money. In the same way points in skills could be put into your community pool could be a
                            reflection of an intentional attempt to establish yourself with the community</para>

                    <title>Selecting a Race</title>
                    <para>Choosing the race of the character affects the primary and calculated statistics. There are often modifiers for the primary statistics (As well as the
                        other statistics) for a given race. Some races have gifts or abilities as well as other trade-offs. For the most part the human races have no modifiers to
                        their statistics. Once you've picked a race just ask your friendly neighborhood games master for the description of the race and the racial modifiers. Those
                        racial modifiers will be recorded and applied later (see <xref linkend="primary-statistics"/>). </para>

                            fact that they tend not, as a race, to collect material goods. A Hairochan will have the following modifiers: <simplelist>

                                <member>Mental Strength +2</member>

                        <para>It is probably right about here that you'll want to pick whether the character is male or female. Females generally do have statistical modifiers. For
                            most races the modifiers are: Physical Strength -2, Physical Endurance +1, Mental Endurance +1</para>

                    <title>Selecting a culture.</title>
                    <para>Once you have decided on the race, picking the culture is the next logical step. Culture influences what skills are available to you as well as the kinds
                        of careers you can go into. Each culture comes with a standard set of skills that can be bought as a bundle. For example the character knowns the native
                        language of the culture as well as the common history and lore of the culture. The character knows how to behave appropriate to their social class in the
                        culture. Each culture has standard sets of these templates. These templates are detailed in the cultural description. In addition, each culture may have
                        special gifts, particular advantages or disadvantages as well as particular additions to the Personal Development, Wealth, and Community pools. Some
                        cultures may have only one dominant culture and thus only one cultural template or they may have many subcultures.</para>
                    <para>Some races have only one culture while some races can be part of more than one culture. You can pick almost any culture for a given race, you just have to
                        come up with a good story to describe how that character ended up with that race in that culture.</para>

                    <title>Careers and History</title>
                    <para>Once characters have established what culture they are in they can pick the careers that they've had along the way. Careers is actually a rather loose
                        time. In this context, living on the street is a career. It is an activity during which you accumulate community, wealth, and skills. This career only
                        applies to the history of the character. </para>

                    <para> These are all terms for the various quirks of genetics and experience that give the characters a distinct flavor to match the history of the character.
                        For example a character may have a gift that allows them to use magic or a disadvantage such as they are albino. Each trade-off that gives or costs a
                        certain number of points from each of the pools. For example, a character that is Albino gets 15 additional points that they can apply to the Wealth,
                        Community, or Skill pools In exchange for the disadvantage while playing of being sensitive to light. </para>
                    <para>These Gifts and trade-offs are just examples. If you have a great idea for a gift or a trade-off it is the GM's job to negotiate it with you and design
                        it.</para>

                            area. The scope denotes the number of different areas that the ability may be applicable to. In the case of raising a character statistic the scope
                            refers to the number of other stats affected.</para>

                    <title>Careers</title>
                    <para> The next step is determining the career path the character took up until the start of play. This is where a majority of a character's skills and history
                        will be developed. The process is fairly simple: the player selects the career they wish to enter and then they roll for the character to gain skills,
                        wealth, and status during each year they are in that career. This means three rolls. One for Personal Development, one for Wealth, and one for status. These
                        three pools : Personal Development, Wealth, and Status are the basis of the final resolution of the character's skills, history, and station. Each of the
                        available paths has its own advantages and disadvantages. Educational careers give one little chance to injure one's self but the possible monetary gains
                        are low. Military careers are dangerous, but the skills gained there may not be available elsewhere. The three pools each have a different basic function.
                        The Personal Development pool serves as the point pool for increasing a PC statistics, skills, or creating special abilities. The Wealth pool contains
                        points to be spent in establishing the character's basic financial state. The Status pool contains points to be spent in gaining all the possible trappings
                        of status: reputation, syncophants, or other recognition. Players do have a limited amount of lateral movement for these points. Each career is delineated
                        by a simple set of numbers combined with a simple description. It has the following format: </para>

		The DF for a MAW or PAW roll to determine the number of personal points
		the character gained in a roll. A successful roll adds points into the 
		Personal Stat Pool. A failed roll adds nothing and a critical failure 
        usually involves the loss of points from the personal pool.

        roll to determine whether or not the character gained in the material 
        or financial area. A successful roll adds Base Financial Gain 
		to the Wealth Pool. This represents the character's gain in free 
		wealth beyond their means of support. i.e. their savings.

        roll to determine whether or not the character gained in  
        Status. A succesful roll adds 1 to the Status Pool.
		Status is a rather subjective thing but typically, a 
        military career leads to increases in rank and possible minor fame. A 
        increase in status in a shadowy career would lead to the development 
        of a "Rep".  Most careers will have a status table that describes 
        the cost of a specific rank or status gain.

                    <para> When characters are first generated they can buy single skills using points from the personal pool. During character generation all skills cost 1 point
                        per rank to purchase. So rank 0 costs 1 point, rank 1 costs 2 points , and so on. After characters have been generated they advance in their skills
                        according to rules described in the Players Guide. In summary single skills cost $ 1 + Rank $ in personal development points. </para>

                    <title>Skill Ranks</title>
                    <para> The meaning of skill ranks varies somewhat based on the rarity of the skill and so on but, in general, the skill ranks map to expertise according to
                        table ~\ref{Table:SkillRanks} on page~\pageref{Table:SkillRanks}. \include{tskill9} Someone is familiar with the skill if they have tried it enough that the
                        tools and techniques are known even if the character has no real practice with them. A character is at a begginer level of skill if they have used the
                        skills enough to be comfortable with all the basic techniques needed even though they may not be consistent in their execution. A character is at a
                        dedicated amateur level of skill if they are consistent in executing all the basic skills even though they have no real comfort with any of the advanced
                        techniques. A solid workaday craftsman is consistent and accomplished in executing all the basic skills and are familiar with the advanced techniques and
                        tools. A professional is consistent and accomplished in te full range of basic and advanced techniques used in routine application of the skill. An expert
                        is consistent and accomplished in all the basic and advanced techniques used in routine application of the skill as well as being familiar with techniques
                        and tools needed for less common usage of the skill. An master is consistent and accomplished in all the techniques used in most applications of the skill.
                        In addition they are familiar with some esoteric techniques needed for bizarre and unusual applications of a skill. An character at a mystical mastery level
                        accomplished in all the techniques used in almost all known applications of the skill. In addition they have a whole series of special techniques and tools
                        they have developed for themselves. </para>

                    <title>Statistic Costs</title>
                    <para> When characters are first generated they can buy statistics using points from the personal pool. During character generation all stats are raised using
                        the costs from the table ~\ref{Table:StatCosts} on page~\pageref{Table:StatCosts}. So adding 1 point of PST costs 4 points, adding 2 costs 8 points, and so
                        on. After characters have been generated they advance in their stats according to rules described in the Players Guide. \input{tcgen4.tex} </para>

                    <title>Skill Packages</title>
                    <para> What we have discussed up till now has been single skills. Quite often the character will be using a skill package. A skill package is a collection of
                        related skills that have a bundled at a bargain cost. A typical skill package would be : \begin{verbatim} Terran Law Enforcement Officer Package Lore:
                        Terran Law Culture Lore: Terran LEO Weapon: Pistol Weapon: Tonfa Weapon: Taser Streetwise Interrogation Data Analysis Computer Ops Cost: 5 \end{verbatim}
                        This package would cost 5 points to get rank 0 in all the listed skills, 10 points to get rank 1 and so on. This compares well to 9 points to get rank 0 in
                        all the skills and 18 points to get rank 1 and so on. After character generation, these skills are raised individually just like any other skill according

                    <title>Enhancements and Limitations</title>
                    <para> After a character has some points in the three pools associated with character creation ( personal, wealth, status) they may choose to use them to buy
                        Enhancements that will add flavour to the character. There are always the base enhancements allowed to the character. The points in the personal pool can be
                        used to buy skills at the generation cost. The points in the personal pool can be used to buy stats at the costs listed in the stat cost tables.
                        Enhancements are gains in either background or special abilities that can be paid for with points from one of the pools. There are two main types. There are
                        Character Enhancements and there are Environmental Enhancements. Character Enhancements are natural aptitudes that are typically permanent and inherent to
                        the character's makeup. Enhanced hearing or eidetic memory are examples of Character Enhancements. Environmental Enhancements are typically advantages that
                        depend on the character to maintain them. Such as inherited wealth and various components of status. </para>

                            So for determining the cost of a single ( Scope = $ 10^0$ ) friend willing to help you all (Depth = Very High ) the time is simply $ 1 + 20 $. The DF
                            describes how willing the person is to help you. So in the example DF = 12 implies +60% to the chance for aid from that person. </para>

                        <para> The first and most commonly used is the wealth advantage. This differs from the basic wealth that can be gained by spending the points from the
                            wealth pool in that the gain is approximately one third that of a pure monetary spend, but the gain so obtained is income that will continue to be
                            generated for as long as the PC pays attention to the interests that generate the funds. The larger the income the more work involved in maintaining it.
                            The scale of the income is derived from table ~\ref{Table:EnvironmentalEnhancementScopeCosts}. The amount of freedom from managing that income is given

                            <para>Each character gets 10 Community points. The Community points are used to purchase status or reputation within one or more communities. The impact
                                of the status or reputation and the size of the community all factor into the cost of that status or reputation. The effect of that status or
                                reputation is dependent on the culture but it may also be dependent on the community chosen. For example a character may choose to buy a higher

                        <para> Once you have decided on the race, picking the culture is the next logical step. Each culture comes with a standard set of skills that can be bought
                            as a bundle. For example the character knowns the native language of the culture as well as the common history and lore of the culture. The character
                            knows how to behave appropriate to their social class in the culture. Each culture has standard sets of these templates. These templates are detailed in
                            the cultural description. In addition, each culture may have special gifts, particular advantages or disadvantages as well as particular additions to
                            the Skill, Wealth, and Community pools.</para>

                            certain number of points from each of the pools. For example, a character that is Albino gets 15 additional points that they can apply to the Wealth,

                            <para>An enhance statistic is the idea that the Character Has a enhanced statistic in some specialized area such as an enhanced sense of smell or
                                Heightened awareness of demons.. Most of the enhancements that involve heightened stats in specialised areas have a simple cost equal to 1/2 the
                                purchase cost of the stats. So someone with a heightened sense of smell would pay one half the cost of Physical Awareness (PAW) or 1/2 * 4 = 2$ for
                                each additional point of increase. So someone with a 12 PAW could pay 8 points of ersonal Development and get a PAW (for smells) of 16. </para>

                <para>Magic Is the ability to manipulate mana. Spell casters use their own internal energies to manipulate Mana. It is not known where Mana comes from, but mana is
                    generally all around us, it flows and pool. The caster uses their own energy to raise, focus, and apply mana. The act of raising, focusing and applying energy
                    is called spell casting. That spellcasting can be very unstructured all the way up to very structured. </para>
                <para>If you view mana as a kind of water then the very unstructured forms of spell casting are like scooping the water up in your hands and splashing them at
                    someone as opposed to creating dams and dikes and pipes and hoses to deliver the water where you want to go. As you go from less structured to more structured
                    it takes less energy to achieve the same result while taking more time and often requiring more care and detail work. The simplest form of casting are cantrips,
                    which of the equivalent of splashing water out of a pool with your hand. They are blazingly quick, not particularly effective for anything beyond very small
                    results like lighting a candle. The next form is slightly more structured, and it is called sorcery. A sorcerer is kind of like a kid with a hand pump who can
                    pull up the water and direct it while dynamically changing with the circumstances so that they can redirect the water at the drop of a hat. The next level up,
                    Wizardry, is much more structured but it does come in a range of complexities from simple structures with tightly focused purposes (Squirt guns), to more
                    general Complicated structures (household plumbing), all the way up to monumental works (the Hoover dam)</para>
                <para>Many has types or flavours</para>
                <para> Each type of mana behaves in its own particular way especially when being manipulated by the caster or when interacting with each other. Some of these ways
                    are very logical. The magical element of water is very effective in combating the magical element of fire. The magical element of fire takes more work to
                    control but produces more damage than the magical element of air. The magical element of dark is diametrically opposed to the magical element of light. There
                    are some energies that human mages can barely get access to and even when they are casting with them they are often on the edge of being out of control. There
                    are also energies that are so phenomenally dangerous that only the most powerful of mages can even attempt to work with them. </para>
                <para>Mana is often used in or generated by the activities of word or spirit, but never as aprimary part of the activity.</para>

                        a human trying to redirect lightning with their bare hands. They have a name for that type of spellcaster, the name is "fuse".</para>

                        difficult to banish and often have lasting effects and echoes. In general even though they are actually highly ordered and structured, that Order is rarely
                        apparent to the spellcaster. These energies are known as Belief, Stream, and Fabric</para>

                        <title>Belief</title>
                        <para> Belief is the energy generated by the exercise of faith. It is very difficult to get a handle on and generally only the gods can reliably use it.
                            This really is the power of miracles. It can be cast and manipulated by mages and is used by priests and priestesses. It despite that there is a
                            fundamental difference between when a mage or priest attempts to manipulate belief and when the divine is present. Don't make the mistake of believing
                            that a priest is simply a mage. A priest is a channel for their deity.</para>

                            Mages and shamans and others such as oracles can use it in much the same way that humans can ride a rhinoceros. You may be physically able to do it, but
                            you really don't have much ability to control the direction it goes. Someone who is using Stream can see what is happened in the past (Generally much
                            easier than any other type of usage of Stream) as well as get a sense of what may be in the future. In general the foreseeings done with Stream are
                            highly influenced by the mental state of the person doing the seeing. In other words, they often see the types of things they would expect to
                            see.</para>

                            relatively easier to control spell castings with Fabric. This is the energy associated with seeing things at a distance (clairvoyance) as well as being

                    <para>The bread-and-butter of most spell casters Elemental powers are fairly easy for a spellcaster to get a handle on. The world is designed in such a way that
                        mages have relatively easy access to the elemental energies. They are generally fast to summon and easy to manipulate and behave according to various rules
                        and principles. They have their own kind of order and will behave in predictable ways. Elemental energies are less likely to have lasting magical effects
                        then the Eternal energies and they can have have fairly lasting physical effects. Most creatures are actually composed of a balance of the elemental
                        energies in a dynamic balance. Too much exposure to any one elemental energy can imbalance an individual and make them sick. One of the first things that
                        most spell casters learn is how to manipulate the energy without taking it into themselves and thus unbalancing themselves. The elemental energies are: </para>

                                damage and consume things. </member>
                            <member>Water - Water is less quick to summon, almost as hard to control as fire, but it is rarely necessary to banish it because you can usually just
                                let it dissipate and run off itself. Water is harder to focus in order to damage. </member>
                            <member>Air - Air is quick to summon and hard to control or banish the losing control rarely involves major damage. Air is very hard to focus in order

                            <member>Earth - Earth is slow to summon, hard to move, and slow to stop. Once going, Earth can do a great deal of damage</member>
                            <member> Light - Light is quick to summon, easy to move, relatively easy to stop although you do need to do it quickly. In general Light does not tend
                                to do a great deal of damage but it's side effects are often more significant ( temporarily blinding someone, distracting someone etc.) </member>
                            <member>Dark - Dark is also quick to summon, easy to move and relatively easy to stop. Like light it does not tend to do a great deal of damage but
                                again its side effects are often significant.</member>
                            <member> Life - Life energies are slightly slower to summon then light and dark, as well as being very hard to focus on something. Life energies are
                                lousy for doing damage with. You can conceivably hit somebody with so much life that they are unbalanced. Life energies are better for certain types
                                of healings and divinations. They are very useful for doing damage to creatures animated by deah such as the undead.</member>
                            <member> Death - Death energies are slightly slower to summon them light and dark, as well as being very hard to focus on something. By the very nature
                                Death energies are useful in injuring living creatures. </member>

                                <member>Shadow - Shadow is normally a fleeting type of energy that is created by the interaction of light and dark. Sometimes you can find pools of
                                    shadow at twilight but generally it exists in those locations between light and dark. While shadow is not the most reliable of elemental
                                    materials it does have some advantages for several key actions: such as confusing a person's eyes, clouding their minds or causing fear. Shadow
                                    also has a "resonance" with other blocks of shadow. As a result, Shadow mages have easier access to the ability to walk from shadow to

                    <title>Description</title>
                    <para>Shamans live in two worlds, the world of flesh and the world of spirits. Since the world was young there have been those who walked between both worlds,
                        existing in both but belonging to neither. It is a shaman’s job to serve both worlds. The shaman serves the spirit world by helping keep a balance between
                        the realm of spirit and the physical realm. The shaman usually aids the spirits by performing rituals of cleansing, or performing rituals to thank the
                        spirits or offer the spirits his body to interact with this world for a short time. Spirits will often grant boons for such services. Deals can also be made
                        with spirits. </para>
                    <para> Shamans will often take on strange taboos which can last for month to years, or maybe his entire life. If these taboos are broken then the shaman loses
                        face in the eyes of the spirit world. But remember, there must always be compensation. The way of the spirits is the way of balance. There is always a cost
                        for every service. Everything must balance in the end. That is not to say that a shaman cannot do something from the goodness of his own heart, but that
                        every favor given is a favor owed and every gain comes with a loss. In the description of some of the shaman’s bonuses and rituals it mentions things like
                        pure places or natural places. Anywhere it says anything like this it means a place either taken back by nature and relatively left alone by man, or places
                        that man have never been. </para>
                    <sect2>
                        <title>Becoming a Shaman</title>
                        <para> They say the first step is the hardest, and this is especially true of shamans. In order to become a shaman one must die first. When the shaman-to-be
                            has a near-death experience (whether intentional or not) and his soul leaves his body, he is met by a spirit guide. It is the spirit guide’s duty to
                            explain all that is expected of the shaman, the hardships he may have to endure and that he will never again be truly a part of mortal society. The
                            spirit will not sugarcoat this, the shaman must be fully aware of what will become of him if he makes this deal. If the deal is made, the guiding spirit
                            becomes the shaman's totem spirit and the shaman is given a permanent taboo, the first of many. The totem spirit will teach the shaman what he needs to
                            know to carry out his duties, and what his rewards will be</para>

                        <title>Constraints</title>
                        <para>Shamans must honour at least one taboo to connect himself to his totem. This Taboo is a life long Taboo. Taboos need not be difficult to fulfill, but
                            it does make the shaman stand out. All Shamans get -1 to Social stat. This negative does not count when dealing with the spirits. If a shaman breaks a
                            taboo he loses the favor of the spirit world. He still retains the ability to interact with the spirit world but loses all bonuses and powers gained
                            from spirits, and none but the most corrupt and wicked spirits will deal with the shaman until the shaman makes amends with the spirit whose taboo he
                            broke. </para>

                            <para> While performing specific rituals, or while under the effect of certain drugs, the shaman can see and hear the spirit world as vague shadows.
                                Also, spirits can see through to this world as a vague shadow, but shamans glow brightly for them. Once a spirit sees a shaman, the spirits can then
                                communicate with the shaman. </para>
                            <para> Only alcohol or natural drugs will allow the shaman to see the spirit world. Shamans are immune to hallucinogenic or mind- altering effects of
                                these drugs and alcohol (though they may still suffer from slurred speech and lowered reflexes and reaction time). Synthetic, man-made drugs will
                                not allow the shaman to see the spirit world. The shaman can look into the spirit world without the use of drugs or alcohol or without performing a
                                ritual. </para>

                                and get a + 5 to save against demonic possession. </para>

                                are aware. A shaman can awaken the spirit in an object or being and communicate with it. An awakened object will strive to become the utmost of what

                                absolutely necessary. The totem spirit is under no actual obligation to come as soon as called, but most will do their best to get to the shaman as
                                quickly as possible. </para>

                    <title>The flow of casting.</title>
                    <para>There are three steps in any manipulation of mana. (whether it be cantrip, spell, ritual or rite). The first is gathering the energy, the second is
                        focusing that energy and the third is releasing it.</para>
                    <sect2>
                        <title>Gathering</title>
                        <para>athering the energy is a fundamental part of the casting process. Most spells will use the mage's internal energy to summon and manipulate the
                            specific type of energy needed. How well a character can access their own power is governed by their PSI stat. Using the power to gather energy expends
                            Mental Fatigue. This MFT can be supplemented by energy from Material Components, Magic Items, Living Sacrifice, Worship, Physical Exertion, or just by
                            being given the energy by another. The skill used in gathering the energy is Manipulate Energy. An ME skill is needed for each type of energy to be
                            manipulated. ME: skills such as ME:Fire can be used to make perception rolls for detecting the energy in question. A perception skill for a specific
                            energy type can be used to determine the intensity and extent of the energy.</para>

                        <title>Focusing</title>
                        <para>In focusing the energy the caster directs and channels the energies toward a specific end. Material components used during this part of the spell
                            would be used for channeling the energies involved \footnote{ Material Component could be damaged (magically) if it cannot contain the energies
                            involved}. Somatic and verbal components add to this part of the spell process as does any meditative state or trance.. The mage determines how much
                            energy will be applied at this point. The time taken in focusing the energies is spent in setting up the various actions to be performed by the energy.
                            The time spent in applying the energy is fairly constant compared to the time spent focusing the energies.</para>

                    <para>Spell types Spells vary in their complexity and in the time it takes to cast them. There are special names for spell casts of a given complexity and cast
                        time. Those names are Sorceries, Cantrips, Spells, Rituals and Rites. </para>

                        <title>Cantrips</title>
                        <para>Cantrips are simple magicks. They are simple in structure and low powered. Often simple material components will supply the power needed. A caster
                            casting cantrips needs to have a skill in Casting:Cantrips in order to be considered ranked in the action they are attempting. </para>

                        <para> A ritual is a highly structured and detailed spell that involves the manipulation of more than one mages worth of energy at a time. In order to do
                            this the caster must gather power from some outside source. To cast rituals requires the Hold Energy skill for energy type being used.</para>

                        <member>Resistance (RES). Resistance is how easily can the spell be resisted. The higher this value is the better it is for the caster. When doing spell
                            design the designer will be modifying Resistance. When the spell design is complete the value for RES will be used to generate the Resistance Difficulty
                            Factor (RDF) Equation 1. Resistence RDF = 7 - Resistance</member>
                        <member>Quantitative Effect (QE). A quantitative value for the total effect a spell can have. QE is a numeric constant. This is translated to actual effect
                            via a table. For Damage or Restoration spells this directly translates as the damage done by the spell.</member>
                        <member>Casting Diffulty Factor (CDF). The Difficulty Factor involved in casting the spell.</member>

                            Active Concentration duration spells last for as long as the caster concenmtrates on the spell. Any other actions the caster may partake of will be
                            considered florentine actions. Passive Concentration duration spells last for as long as the caster is concious and or clear minded. Permanent spells
                            last until dispelled or disrupted. Spells that have a numeric duration buy the scale and value of the duration. By default the scale is in pulses and
                            the value is the mage's PSI. .</para>

                        Investment Rituals are specific to the energy being used. Normally, invested items can resist. With sufficient preparation the resistance can be dropped to
                        0. Warding rituals are similiar. \section{Spell Design Tables} \tiny </para>
