                <para>A player character (<abbrev>PC</abbrev>) is a fictional character created and controlled by a
                    player. The PC is the primary means through which the player interacts with the game world and
                    experiences the game's narrative. A PC is defined with a mixture of statistics, skills, special
                    abilities, advantages and disadvantages. The basics of those are described in the following
                    sections</para>

                        sets of statistics: Primary and Secondary. Primary statistics are picked by the player during
                        character generation and the secondary statistics are calculated from the primary statistics. </para>

                    <para>Characters have skills. A skill is the trained ability to perform a task or activity
                        effectively and efficiently. It often involves a combination of knowledge, practice, and
                        experience. Skills can be acquired through learning and training, and they can range from basic
                        tasks, like typing or cooking, to complex abilities, like programming or negotiating.
                        Essentially, a skill is something you can do well as a result of practice and application.

                        In <emphasis>Hybrid</emphasis> we use a combinations of dice (4 sided, 6 sided,8 sided,10
                        sided,12 sided, and 20 sided) to generate a wide range of numbers. The most commonly used

                    <title>What do I see and When can I act</title>
                    <para>Most gaming occurs in "Storytelling" Time. Time is mostly referred to by the units we are used to,
                        hours, minutes, and seconds. The GM typically tells the players how much time has passed and
                        handles the sequencing and general "fairness". Sometimes, the story being told requires more
                        detailed time keeping, we will slice time up into finer pieces.</para>
                    <para>In order to tell a story , no matter what the time frame, we need mechanisms that allow the characters
                        to determine what they can perceive, figure out who goes first, what actions they can perform, 
                        and how well they succeed at those actions. 
                        But the one thing that's common to almost all the situations that are being resolved no matter
                        what the time scale is how to get answers to the following two questions: "What do I perceive?" and
                        "When can I act?", and when I act: "How well did I succeed or fail?"</para>
                    <formalpara>
                        <title>Perception</title>
                        <para>Perception is the answer to answer to "What do I perceive?". Each player has awareness stats that can be used in combination with skills and a percentile roll 
                            to help them figure out what can be seen, heard, felt or sensed. For more details see TBD.

                            to help them figure out who acts when.  For more details see TBD.

                        difficulty for the tasks lumped together is the difficulty of the toughest task.</para>
                    <para> Jogging across the street and leaping a small fence are actions that are best lumped together
                        into one task. There is no reason to ask the player to roll for each action. But if the
                        character stands the chance of being exposed to someone looking for him then a roll should be
                        made for the entire set of actions.</para>

                        <para>Most gaming occurs in "Storytelling" Time. Time is referred to by the units we are used
                            to, hours, minutes, and seconds. The GM typically tells the players how much time has passed
                            and handles the sequencing and general "fairness". Sometimes, the story being told requires
                            more detailed time keeping, we will slice time up into finer pieces.</para>
                    </formalpara>
                    <formalpara>
                        <title>How do things happen</title>
                        <para>Most actions that a character or non-player character takes in a game are resolved by
                            determining how difficult the action is and rolling percentile dice to determine the success
                            or failure of the action. The difficulty of the action is referred to as the
                            <emphasis>Difficulty Factor or (DF) </emphasis> and the chance to succeed is determined
                            from the Success Table below. A Skill Roll is done by figuring out the Difficulty Factor of
                            a task and looking at the row on the table that is under or equal to that Difficulty Factor.
                            The player rolls percentile dice (1-100) and looks at the column to the right and determines
                            the number that the die roll is under. If the die roll is under the number in the "Success"
                            column then the character succeeded at what they attempted. If not, they failed. There are
                            degrees of success that range from "Oh Wow!" (Amazing Success) to "Oh No!" (Amazing
                            Failure). </para>

                    <title>Perception</title>
                    <para>If something could go unnoticed by the character, such as a suprise attack or something
                        hidden, the player should make a Perception Roll. A perception roll is typically SB = PAW, DF=0,
                        with modifiers for how alert the character is trying to be. A perception roll takes 8 counts. A
                        \ndx{Passive Perception Roll can be made Perception!Passive during any action at 1/4 the success
                        chance of a normal perception roll. A passive perception roll takes no time and takes no
                        modifiers for simultaneous actions.</para>
                    <para>The critical success and failure effects are fairly straight forward</para>
                    <para>One Skill Roll that is done by every character is a Perception roll. How well a character does
                        on a Perception Roll determines how alert a character is and how well they can react to a combat
                        or non-combat situation.</para>
                    <para>Most of the time a situation is self evident to a character. A character automatically knows
                        that there is a bar in the room and how many people are in it. In order to determine how much
                        the character has "taken in" their environment the GamesMaster may ask the player to roll a
                        Skill Check called the Perception Roll. It is just a standard percentile dice roll. As a result
                        of the roll the GamesMaster will tell you how much the character takes in and understands.
                        Typically , a character intentionally paying attention to the environment takes about a second
                        to take it in. Players may also ask to make "Passive Perception" rolls to determine what their
                        character is able to take in "in passing" rather then paying attention with intent.</para>

                <para>A skill is the ability to perform a task or activity effectively and efficiently. It often
                    involves a combination of knowledge, practice, and experience. Skills can be acquired through
                    learning and training, and they can range from basic tasks, like typing or cooking, to complex
                    abilities, like programming or negotiating. Essentially, a skill is something you can do well as a
                    result of practice and application.</para>

                            the Slug Pistol so the character can only apply 1/5 of his expertise in Slug Pistol to using

                        <para>Skills that are described as general skills cover a wide range of tasks with very little
                            depth. A person who has learned a general skill such as Throw Object is able to throw just
                            about anything they can get their hands on ( knives, spoons, rocks, chairs) with a lesser
                            success chance than someone who has a specific skill in throwing a particular object</para>
                        <para>In addition, there are skills known as support skills that are solely Skills!Support
                            designed to increase the success chance when doing one type of action with a skill. Someone
                            who uses their sword to parry weapon attacks may wish to train specifically in parrying with
                            a sword. So they would have a ``Long Sword' skill and a ``Long Sword : Parry'' skill.</para>
                        <para>General skills only give 1%/rank to the success chance. Specific skills (the SH norm),
                            give 4%/rank. Support Skills add 2%/rank. There is no limit on the number of support skills
                            that may be applied to a single task.</para>

                        <para>SThere is a category of skills which affects the use of other skills in an environment
                            different from the one they were learned in. These skills are called filter skills. A Filter
                            skill is any skill that can allow for the full expression of other skills in an environment
                            other than that for which those skills were designed for.</para>
                        <para>Typical filter skills include the following: 0-g maneuver, Tech Level Lore, Culture Lore,
                            Mounted Combat, Vehicular Combat skills, Armor Wearing, and Computer operations.</para>
                        <para>For situations in which the character is attempting to apply a skill in a environment he
                            is not familiar with and that skill must interact with that environment, then the rank in
                            the filter skill becomes the upper limit on the effective rank of the skill being
                            used.</para>
                        <para>As an example, if someone has a mounted combat skill at rank 5, he or she may use their
                            archery skill up to rank 5 without making any rolls against their mounted combat. If the
                            character has a higher archery skill and wants to bring it all to bear on a shot, they must
                            roll against their mounted combat first in order to get the full use of the archery
                            skill.</para>

                            only be done once the character has decided to use a given skill. </para>

                        <title>Preset Reactions</title>

                            certain way when it does the charcetr is presetting an action. A gunfighter waiting for
                            someone else to start drawing their weapon is a preset action. Having a preset action allows
                            the character to increase the chance of detecting the triggering action and speeds up the
                            preset action. Holding a preset action can be fatiguing over long periods of time. </para>
                        <para> Declaring an action to be preset allows an DF +4 to a perception roll. If the perception
                            roll is successful, the character gets to apply their $ 2 \times Speed_{Reaction $. A Preset
                            reaction may only be held for MST in the time scale that the players are working in before a
                            cost of 1 MFT must be expended. </para>

                        point. The speed of the action is determined and the character takes this action on a count

                    <title>Speeds of Actions</title>
                    <para> Most actions have a speed associated with them. All simple actions, unless otherwise noted,
                        have a standard speed of 10 count. </para>
                    <para>Actions can be performed faster. Speeding up an action lowers the chance of success. Generally
                        half the time to act means you have half the chance to succeed.</para>
                    <para>For each percentage of time units the action is sped up a corresponding percentage is removed
                        the success chance. Thus an action performed in 1/4 the time has 1/4 the success chance.</para>

                    <title>Using Energy: Fatigue and Exhaustion</title>
                    <para>A character using energy to perform actions draws from two different types of reservoirs:
                        Fatigue and Exhaustion. For physical actions the stats are Physical Fatigue and Physical
                        Exhaustion (PFT and PEX). For mental actions the stats are Mental Fatigue and Mental Exhaustion
                        (MFT and MEX).</para>
                    <para>Fatigue is the quick access pool of energy a character can use. Exhaustion is the reserve pool
                        of energy a character can use.</para>
                    <para>A character loses fatigue as the result of physical activity or combat. A character that has
                        lost all their fatigue has no modifiers to their actions. Fatigue will come back quickly. For
                        each 10 points of fatigue used the character also loses 1 point of exhaustion.</para>
                    <para>A character loses Exhaustion by performing strenous activity or by losing fatigue. There are
                        modifiers for being low in Exhaustion.</para>

                            run out of street he will have covered 4 * 15 = 60 meters. If this seems a bit short, keep

                        <para>It is important to remember that the accelleration rules should only be used when the

                    <para>In dealing with movement on a pulse by pulse scale we need to actually deal with acceleration.
                        The sequence is quite simple. Whatever the final movement rate is that the character intends to
                        use is considered the target movement rate. When the character first starts moving he makes an
                        skill roll in order to start moving at the movement rate just below the target movement rate.
                        Once the roll is made the character is now moving at that lower rate. On his next initiative the
                        character may attempt to accelerate to the target movement. Note that the gain number is the
                        movement rate. If an acceleration roll is failed the end result is that the character drops to
                        the next lowest available movement rate.</para>

                                may be greater in strength than 5 * PST of the holder. The opponent may reduce the

                                speed. DF -5 against Thrown, DF -30 against Projectile, DF -40 against NRG. This is
                                simply a skill opposition roll.</para>
                            <para>Side effects of parrying:</para>
                            <para>If a defender succeeds in a parry by less than 5% the two weapons are assumed to have
                                become ``Bound'' and the attacker has advanced on the defender. See rules on advance.
                                The defender may roll at their next initiative to release the weapon. This is a skill
                                opposition roll</para>
                            <para>If the attacker fails to avoid a parry by more than 25% then the attacker is
                                effectively off balance and is subject to DFs just as if they had failed a system shock
                                roll.</para>

                            <para>A block is an attempt to use a weapon or a shield to provide addition armor against
                                damage. DF -2. If the block is successful the defender rolls damage with the weapon and
                                can apply that damage as armor. Speed as per 1/2 weapon speed.</para>

                            <subtitle/>
                            <para>OK, you know you are going to get hit, you have no time for any other defense then to
                                try and roll with the blow and thus avoid being stunned or knocked out.</para>
                            <para>The act of rolling with the blow involves an attempt to take the alloted damage but
                                absorb it in such a way that the normal secondary effects such as stun or knockback do
                                not take effect. The action requires no time but does require that the defender be aware
                                of the attack and declare that he wishes to roll with the attack. The base roll goes
                                against PAG for physical attacks and MAG for mental attacks. It adds DF +5 to the System
                                Shock roll if any is made. The act of rolling with the blow causes a reroll of
                                initiative.</para>

                    <para>In the real world physical strength refers to the ability of a person’s muscles to exert force
                        against resistance. It is a measure of the maximum force or power a muscle or group of muscles
                        can produce during a specific action. Physical strength can be broken into several different
                        expression of that ability (detailed below). Physical Strength in <emphasis>Hybrid</emphasis> is
                        a measure that combines all of those into one number. </para>

                            the Slug Pistol so the character can only apply 1/5 of his expertise in Slug Pistol to using
                            this pistol. So he has an effective rank 2 in the weapon.</para>

                        set of psionic abilities. A great deal of the limitations described here are indeed
                        implementation specific and could be changed on GM's whim. </para>

                        access psionics. Characters that take the Active Psionics enhancement (often part of a racial
                        package ) will have recieved concious training or have been raised in a high-psi environment and
                        absorbed an instinctual level of usage. </para>

                    <para> There are several things of note to be mentioned. The first and foremost is that it is always
                        easier to affect inanimate objects with Psionics. </para>
                    <para> When attempting to affect other entities the percentage chance to succeed is lowered by the
                        defending entities MDF. An actively defending individual lowers it by 2 * MDF. In addition,
                        there are a number of situations (critical misses, instinctively defending opponents) that could
                        cause the psionic great pain when attempting to affect a living creature. </para>

                            three times per pulse. If more than that is needed , give it up. Psionics may use special
                            aids in concentrating including: Meditation, Ear Plugs, Drugs etc... </para>

                        technique is typified by a very nebulous region of skills called KI skills. </para>
                    <para> The other technique is that of meditation. Meditation is the act of excludng all outside
                        disturbances from affecting your concentration. </para>

                    <para> Research is an attempt to locate information that is already discovered but not readily
                        available. Experimentation is an attempt to discover previously unknown information by using
                        various experiments to collect data. </para>
                    <para> Research is critical to many of the exploration and discovery scenarios of role playing that
                        are so easy to envision in a Space Age game. The greatest problem is to determine whether or not
                        the character has the research resources to allow a relatively simple time of it. </para>

                    <title>Overview</title>
                    <para> In a role-playing game (RPG), a player character (PC) is a fictional character created and
                        controlled by a player. The PC is the primary means through which the player interacts with the
                        game world and experiences the game's narrative. The characteristics of a player character
                        typically include: </para>

                        <title>Identity and Background</title>
                        <para>The PC has a unique backstory, personality, and set of motivations that influence their
                            actions and decisions within the game. This background helps to shape how the character
                            reacts to events and interacts with other characters.</para>

                        <para>The PC has specific attributes (like strength, intelligence, dexterity) and abilities
                            (such as combat skills, magic, or technical expertise) that define their strengths and
                            weaknesses. These attributes often impact how the character performs in various situations

                            affect the outcome of the game. Their actions and decisions can influence the game's world,

                        pool. During character generation all stats are raised using the costs from the table
                        ~\ref{Table:StatCosts} on page~\pageref{Table:StatCosts}. So adding 1 point of PST costs 4
                        points, adding 2 costs 8 points, and so on. After characters have been generated they advance in
                        their stats according to rules described in the Players Guide.</para>

                    <para>When characters are first generated they can buy statistics using points from the personal
                        pool. During character generation all stats are raised using the costs from the table
                        ~\ref{Table:StatCosts} on page~\pageref{Table:StatCosts}. So adding 1 point of PST costs 4
                        points, adding 2 costs 8 points, and so on. After characters have been generated they advance in
                        their stats according to rules described in the Players Guide. \input{tcgen4.tex}</para>

                    <para>With the race, gender, and culture selected all of the primary statistics are modified and the
                        calculated statistics can be determined. Like the primary statistics, the calculated statistics
                        are evenly broken up into sets of physical and mental statistics. The list below describes the
                        statistics and how they are calculated. Wherever you see the phrase Racial Modifier, there is
                        probably a mention of the racial modifier in the racial description that you would apply here.
                        For most of you the easiest thing to do is to use one of the supplied spreadsheets and let it do
                        the work.</para>

                    <para>These are all terms for the various quirks of genetics and experience that give the characters
                        a distinct flavor to match the history of the character. For example a character may have a gift
                        that allows them to use magic or a disadvantage such as they are albino. Each trade-off that
                        gives or costs a certain number of points from each of the pools. For example, a character that
                        is Albino gets 15 additional points that they can apply to the Wealth, Community, or Skill pools
                        In exchange for the disadvantage while playing of being sensitive to light.</para>
                    <para>These Gifts and trade-offs are just examples. If you have a great idea for a gift or a
                        trade-off it is the GM's job to negotiate it with you and design it.</para>

                        <para>Character Enhancements have both a Depth and Scope that govern their cost. Depth refers to
                            the numeric advantage given by the enhancement in a given area. The scope denotes the number
                            of different areas that the ability may be applicable to. In the case of raising a character
                            statistic the scope refers to the number of other stats affected.</para>

                        <title>Enhancements and Limitations</title>
                        <para>After a character has some points in the three pools associated with character creation (
                            personal, wealth, status) they may choose to use them to buy Enhancements that will add
                            flavour to the character. There are always the base enhancements allowed to the character.
                            The points in the personal pool can be used to buy skills at the generation cost. The points
                            in the personal pool can be used to buy stats at the costs listed in the stat cost tables.
                            Enhancements are gains in either background or special abilities that can be paid for with
                            points from one of the pools. There are two main types. There are Character Enhancements and
                            there are Environmental Enhancements. Character Enhancements are natural aptitudes that are
                            typically permanent and inherent to the character's makeup. Enhanced hearing or eidetic
                            memory are examples of Character Enhancements. Environmental Enhancements are typically
                            advantages that depend on the character to maintain them. Such as inherited wealth and
                            various components of status. </para>

Depth is how deeply they are affected by the enhancement.

<row><entry>	Low        </entry><entry>1 & 1</entry></row>

<row><entry>	Very High  </entry><entry>12 & 20</entry></row>
	\end{tabular}
    \caption{Cost of Environmental Enhancement Depth}
\end{table}
--> So for determining the cost of a single ( Scope = $ 10^0$ ) friend willing to help
                                you all (Depth = Very High ) the time is simply $ 1 + 20 $. The DF describes how willing

                        <para>Enhancements are gains in either background or special abilities that can be paid for with

                            <para>Character Enhancements have both Depth and Scope to help govern their cost. Depth
                                refers to the numeric advantage given by the enhancemnet in a given area. The scope
                                denotes the number of different areas that the spab may be applicable to. In the case of
                                raising a character statistic the scope refers to the number of other stats
                                affected.</para>
                            <para>A character enhancement that involves enhancing a statistic is different from raising
                                the statistic. A raised statistic ends up increasing the SB of the character in that
                                stat. The enhanced stat increases the Rank of the character for any direct rolls against
                                that stat. Thus an Enhanced Stat affects Saving Throws and Concentration Checks.</para>

                                            increase. So someone with a 12 PAW could pay 8 points of ersonal Development

                    <title>Tradeoffs</title>
                    <para>After a character has some points in the three pools associated with character creation (
                        personal, wealth, status) they may choose to use Tradeoffs that will add flavour to the
                        character. There are some Tradeoffs that cost points to buy (Which can come out of any of the
                        pools) that give the character an Advantage of some sort. There are also Tradeoffs that are
                        disadvantages but by taking on that disadvantage you get more points to use for those pools.
                        Some Advantages are built into the character and others require the character to maintain them
                        in some way. For example enhanced hearing or eidetic memory are Built in while something like
                        inherited wealth or reputation may depend on the character to maintain them</para>

                            equal to 1/2 the purchase cost of the stats. So someone with a heightened sense of smell
                            would pay one half the cost of Physical Awareness (PAW) or 1/2 * 4 = 2$ for each additional
                            point of increase. So someone with a 12 PAW could pay 8 points of ersonal Development and
                            get a PAW (for smells) of 16.</para>

                            as other enhanced stats. So Enhanced Physical Presence is 2 points per additional effect.
                            Decreased Physical Presence is 2 points per subtracted effect. Enhanced Mental Presence is 2
                            points per additional effect. Decreased Mental Presence is 2 points per subtracted effect.

                <section>
                    <title>Selecting a culture.</title>
                    <para>Once you have decided on the race, picking the culture is the next logical step. Culture
                        influences what skills are available to you as well as the kinds of careers you can go into.
                        Each culture comes with a standard set of skills that can be bought as a bundle. For example the
                        character knowns the native language of the culture as well as the common history and lore of
                        the culture. The character knows how to behave appropriate to their social class in the culture.
                        Each culture has standard sets of these templates. These templates are detailed in the cultural
                        description. In addition, each culture may have special gifts, particular advantages or
                        disadvantages as well as particular additions to the Personal Development, Wealth, and Community
                        pools. Some cultures may have only one dominant culture and thus only one cultural template or
                        they may have many subcultures.</para>
                    <para>Some races have only one culture while some races can be part of more than one culture. You
                        can pick almost any culture for a given race, you just have to come up with a good story to
                        describe how that character ended up with that race in that culture.</para>

                    <title>Skill Packages</title>
                    <para>What we have discussed up till now has been single skills. Quite often the character will be
                        using a skill package. A skill package is a collection of related skills that have a bundled at
                        a bargain cost. A typical skill package would be : \begin{verbatim} Terran Law Enforcement
                        Officer Package Lore: Terran Law Culture Lore: Terran LEO Weapon: Pistol Weapon: Tonfa Weapon:
                        Taser Streetwise Interrogation Data Analysis Computer Ops Cost: 5 \end{verbatim} This package
                        would cost 5 points to get rank 0 in all the listed skills, 10 points to get rank 1 and so on.
                        This compares well to 9 points to get rank 0 in all the skills and 18 points to get rank 1 and
                        so on. After character generation, these skills are raised individually just like any other
                        skill according to rules described in the Players Guide. </para>

                <section>
                    <title>Careers</title>
                    <para>The next step is determining the career path the character took up until the start of play.
                        This is where a majority of a character's skills and history will be developed. The process is
                        fairly simple: the player selects the career they wish to enter and then they roll for the
                        character to gain skills, wealth, and status during each year they are in that career. This
                        means three rolls. One for Personal Development, one for Wealth, and one for status. These three
                        pools : Personal Development, Wealth, and Status are the basis of the final resolution of the
                        character's skills, history, and station. Each of the available paths has its own advantages and
                        disadvantages. Educational careers give one little chance to injure one's self but the possible
                        monetary gains are low. Military careers are dangerous, but the skills gained there may not be
                        available elsewhere. The three pools each have a different basic function. The Personal
                        Development pool serves as the point pool for increasing a PC statistics, skills, or creating
                        special abilities. The Wealth pool contains points to be spent in establishing the character's
                        basic financial state. The Status pool contains points to be spent in gaining all the possible
                        trappings of status: reputation, syncophants, or other recognition. Players do have a limited
                        amount of lateral movement for these points. Each career is delineated by a simple set of
                        numbers combined with a simple description. It has the following format:</para>
                    <!--

		The DF for a MAW or PAW roll to determine the number of personal points
		the character gained in a roll. A successful roll adds points into the 
		Personal Stat Pool. A failed roll adds nothing and a critical failure 
        usually involves the loss of points from the personal pool.  
        \footnote{!!!! Add a description in the beginning of the PG for DF and rolls}

        roll to determine whether or not the character gained in the material 
        or financial area. A successful roll adds Base Financial Gain 
		to the Wealth Pool. This represents the character's gain in free 
		wealth beyond their means of support. i.e. their savings.
       <varlistentry><term>Status</term><listitem><para>The DF for a MAW or PAW</para></listitem></varlistentry>
        roll to determine whether or not the character gained in  
        Status. A succesful roll adds 1 to the Status Pool.
		Status is a rather subjective thing but typically, a 
        military career leads to increases in rank and possible minor fame. A 
        increase in status in a shadowy career would lead to the development 
        of a "Rep".  Most careers will have a status table that describes 
        the cost of a specific rank or status gain.

                        their skills according to rules described in the Players Guide. In summary single skills cost $

                    <para>The meaning of skill ranks varies somewhat based on the rarity of the skill and so on but, in
                        general, the skill ranks map to expertise according to table ~\ref{Table:SkillRanks} on
                        page~\pageref{Table:SkillRanks}. \include{tskill9} Someone is familiar with the skill if they
                        have tried it enough that the tools and techniques are known even if the character has no real
                        practice with them. A character is at a begginer level of skill if they have used the skills
                        enough to be comfortable with all the basic techniques needed even though they may not be
                        consistent in their execution. A character is at a dedicated amateur level of skill if they are
                        consistent in executing all the basic skills even though they have no real comfort with any of
                        the advanced techniques. A solid workaday craftsman is consistent and accomplished in executing
                        all the basic skills and are familiar with the advanced techniques and tools. A professional is
                        consistent and accomplished in te full range of basic and advanced techniques used in routine
                        application of the skill. An expert is consistent and accomplished in all the basic and advanced
                        techniques used in routine application of the skill as well as being familiar with techniques
                        and tools needed for less common usage of the skill. An master is consistent and accomplished in
                        all the techniques used in most applications of the skill. In addition they are familiar with
                        some esoteric techniques needed for bizarre and unusual applications of a skill. An character at
                        a mystical mastery level accomplished in all the techniques used in almost all known
                        applications of the skill. In addition they have a whole series of special techniques and tools
                        they have developed for themselves.</para>

                        <para>What we have discussed up till now has been single skills. Quite often the character will
                            be using a skill package. A skill package is a collection of related skills that have a

                        <para>Each character gets 10 Community points. The Community points are used to purchase status
                            or reputation within one or more communities. The impact of the status or reputation and the
                            size of the community all factor into the cost of that status or reputation. The effect of
                            that status or reputation is dependent on the culture but it may also be dependent on the
                            community chosen. For example a character may choose to buy a higher reputation among mages
                            rather than having a general reputation. You can add to your Community points as a by

                <title>Back Story</title>

                <para>The fun of the character generation process is designing the story that describes how the
                    character got to be the way they are. Along the way you choose the statistics and skills consistent
                    with that story. I would suggest starting by picking the race and the culture and going from there.
                    Once the race and culture are picked, then you select history that leads you towards the skills that
                    you want. Along the way you determine what skills particular to the culture you picked up as well as
                    whatever gifts the character was born with and Any advantages or disadvantages they picked up along
                    the way.</para>

                    <para>Once characters have established what culture they are in they can pick the careers that
                        they've had along the way. Careers is actually a rather loose time. In this context, living on
                        the street is a career. It is an activity during which you accumulate community, wealth, and
                        skills. This career only applies to the history of the character.</para>

                    <para>As you create the character there will be several groupings of points that you will be adding
                        to or taking away from. Your character starts out with 10 points for skills, 10 points for
                        wealth, and 10 points for community.</para>

                            wealth buy you is completely dependent upon the culture you're coming from.</para>

                        <para>The Points of community are used to purchase status or reputation within the community.
                            For the most part the effect that the points of Community have is dependent on the culture
                            but can also be impacted by the community chosen. For example a character may choose to buy
                            a higher reputation among mages rather than having a general reputation.</para>

                        <para>The way that points can be added to and taken away from these pools reflects the kind of
                            choices that the player as a storyteller can make as well as the kinds of choices the
                            character can make while growing up. For example, the character can use the points in wealth
                            for buying skills reflecting the choice of concentrating on skills or career rather than
                            money. In the same way points in skills could be put into your community pool could be a
                            reflection of an intentional attempt to establish yourself with the community</para>

                        character starts out with. Some cultural templates may have a cost that must be paid from the
                        Personal Development pool.</para>
                    <para> As a result of growing up in a given environment the character gains skill in how to maneuver
                        in that environment. i.e. A character born and raised in an zero-gravity environment will have
                        high skills in Movement:0-g and little or no skills in Movement:1-g. </para>

                            <para>What we have discussed up till now has been single skills. Quite often the character

                                have a bundled at a bargain cost. </para>

                                get rank 1 and so on. This compares well to 9 points to get rank 0 in all the skills and
                                18 points to get rank 1 and so on. After character generation, these skills are raised
                                individually just like any other skill according to rules described in the Players

                        <para> When characters are first generated they can buy statistics using points from the
                            personal pool. During character generation all stats are raised using the costs from the
                            table ~\ref{Table:StatCosts} on page~\pageref{Table:StatCosts}. So adding 1 point of PST
                            costs 4 points, adding 2 costs 8 points, and so on. After characters have been generated
                            they advance in their stats according to rules described in the Players Guide.</para>

                        <para> After a character has some points in the three pools associated with character creation (
                            personal, wealth, status) they may choose to use them to buy Enhancements that will add
                            flavour to the character. </para>
                        <para> There are always the base enhancements allowed to the character. The points in the
                            personal pool can be used to buy skills at the generation cost. The points in the personal
                            pool can be used to buy stats at the costs listed in the stat cost tables. </para>
                        <para> Enhancements are gains in either background or special abilities that can be paid for
                            with points from one of the pools. There are two main types. There are Character
                            Enhancements and there are Environmental Enhancements. </para>
                        <para> Character Enhancements are natural aptitudes that are typically permanent and inherent to
                            the character's makeup. Enhanced hearing or eidetic memory are examples of Character
                            Enhancements. </para>
                        <para> Environmental Enhancements are typically advantages that depend on the character to
                            maintain them. Such as inherited wealth and various components of status. </para>
                        <section>

                            <para> Character Enhancements have both Depth and Scope to help govern their cost. Depth
                                refers to the numeric advantage given by the enhancemnet in a given area. The scope
                                denotes the number of different areas that the spab may be applicable to. In the case of
                                raising a character statistic the scope refers to the number of other stats affected. </para>
                            <para> A character enhancement that involves enhancing a statistic is different from raising
                                the statistic. A raised statistic ends up increasing the SB of the character in that
                                stat. The enhanced stat increases the Rank of the character for any direct rolls against
                                that stat. Thus an Enhanced Stat affects Saving Throws and Concentration Checks. </para>

                <para>The fun of the character generation process is designing the story that describes how the
                    character got to be the way they are. Along the way you choose the statistics and skills consistent
                    with that story. I would suggest starting by picking the race and the culture and going from there.
                    Once the race and culture are picked, then you select history that leads you towards the skills that
                    you want. Along the way you determine what skills particular to the culture you picked up as well as
                    whatever gifts the character was born with and Any advantages or disadvantages they picked up along
                    the way.</para>

                    <title>Personal Development, Community, and Wealth points</title>
                    <para>As you create the character there will be several groupings of points that you will be adding
                        to or taking away from. Your character starts out with 10 points for skills, 10 points for
                        wealth, and 10 points for community. </para>

                        <para>The points for Wealth are used to pick the amount of money or the amount and quality of
                            materials the character starts with. How much actual money or material goods those points of
                            wealth buy you is completely dependent upon the culture you're coming from.</para>

                            For the most part the effect that the points of Community have is dependent on the culture
                            but can also be impacted by the community chosen. For example a character may choose to buy
                            a higher reputation among mages rather than having a general reputation. </para>

                        <para>The way that points can be added to and taken away from these pools reflects the kind of
                            choices that the player as a storyteller can make as well as the kinds of choices the
                            character can make while growing up. For example, the character can use the points in wealth
                            for buying skills reflecting the choice of concentrating on skills or career rather than
                            money. In the same way points in skills could be put into your community pool could be a
                            reflection of an intentional attempt to establish yourself with the community</para>

                    <title>Selecting a Race</title>
                    <para>Choosing the race of the character affects the primary and calculated statistics. There are
                        often modifiers for the primary statistics (As well as the other statistics) for a given race.
                        Some races have gifts or abilities as well as other trade-offs. For the most part the human
                        races have no modifiers to their statistics. Once you've picked a race just ask your friendly
                        neighborhood games master for the description of the race and the racial modifiers. Those racial
                        modifiers will be recorded and applied later (see <xref linkend="primary-statistics"/>). </para>

                            to collect material goods. A Hairochan will have the following modifiers: <simplelist>

                        <para>It is probably right about here that you'll want to pick whether the character is male or
                            female. Females generally do have statistical modifiers. For most races the modifiers are:
                            Physical Strength -2, Physical Endurance +1, Mental Endurance +1</para>

                    <title>Selecting a culture.</title>
                    <para>Once you have decided on the race, picking the culture is the next logical step. Culture
                        influences what skills are available to you as well as the kinds of careers you can go into.
                        Each culture comes with a standard set of skills that can be bought as a bundle. For example the
                        character knowns the native language of the culture as well as the common history and lore of
                        the culture. The character knows how to behave appropriate to their social class in the culture.
                        Each culture has standard sets of these templates. These templates are detailed in the cultural
                        description. In addition, each culture may have special gifts, particular advantages or
                        disadvantages as well as particular additions to the Personal Development, Wealth, and Community
                        pools. Some cultures may have only one dominant culture and thus only one cultural template or
                        they may have many subcultures.</para>
                    <para>Some races have only one culture while some races can be part of more than one culture. You
                        can pick almost any culture for a given race, you just have to come up with a good story to
                        describe how that character ended up with that race in that culture.</para>

                    <title>Careers and History</title>
                    <para>Once characters have established what culture they are in they can pick the careers that
                        they've had along the way. Careers is actually a rather loose time. In this context, living on
                        the street is a career. It is an activity during which you accumulate community, wealth, and
                        skills. This career only applies to the history of the character. </para>

                    <title>Gifts, Advantages, Limitations, and Trade-offs</title>
                    <para> These are all terms for the various quirks of genetics and experience that give the
                        characters a distinct flavor to match the history of the character. For example a character may
                        have a gift that allows them to use magic or a disadvantage such as they are albino. Each
                        trade-off that gives or costs a certain number of points from each of the pools. For example, a
                        character that is Albino gets 15 additional points that they can apply to the Wealth, Community,
                        or Skill pools In exchange for the disadvantage while playing of being sensitive to light. </para>
                    <para>These Gifts and trade-offs are just examples. If you have a great idea for a gift or a
                        trade-off it is the GM's job to negotiate it with you and design it.</para>

                        <para>Character Enhancements have both a Depth and Scope that govern their cost. Depth refers to
                            the numeric advantage given by the enhancement in a given area. The scope denotes the number
                            of different areas that the ability may be applicable to. In the case of raising a character
                            statistic the scope refers to the number of other stats affected.</para>

                            <para> This enhancement reflects other people's innate awareness of the character in a given
                                area. A person with a high presence is hard to ignore. It is calculated in just the same
                                way as other enhanced stats. So Enhanced Physical Presence is 2 points per additional
                                effect. Decreased Physical Presence is 2 points per subtracted effect. Enhanced Mental
                                Presence is 2 points per additional effect. Decreased Mental Presence is 2 points per
                                subtracted effect. The decreased presence enhancements are, in effect, stealth
                                enhancements. </para>

                    <title>Careers</title>
                    <para> The next step is determining the career path the character took up until the start of play.
                        This is where a majority of a character's skills and history will be developed. The process is
                        fairly simple: the player selects the career they wish to enter and then they roll for the
                        character to gain skills, wealth, and status during each year they are in that career. This
                        means three rolls. One for Personal Development, one for Wealth, and one for status. These three
                        pools : Personal Development, Wealth, and Status are the basis of the final resolution of the
                        character's skills, history, and station. Each of the available paths has its own advantages and
                        disadvantages. Educational careers give one little chance to injure one's self but the possible
                        monetary gains are low. Military careers are dangerous, but the skills gained there may not be
                        available elsewhere. The three pools each have a different basic function. The Personal
                        Development pool serves as the point pool for increasing a PC statistics, skills, or creating
                        special abilities. The Wealth pool contains points to be spent in establishing the character's
                        basic financial state. The Status pool contains points to be spent in gaining all the possible
                        trappings of status: reputation, syncophants, or other recognition. Players do have a limited
                        amount of lateral movement for these points. Each career is delineated by a simple set of
                        numbers combined with a simple description. It has the following format: </para>

		The DF for a MAW or PAW roll to determine the number of personal points
		the character gained in a roll. A successful roll adds points into the 
		Personal Stat Pool. A failed roll adds nothing and a critical failure 
        usually involves the loss of points from the personal pool.

        roll to determine whether or not the character gained in the material 
        or financial area. A successful roll adds Base Financial Gain 
		to the Wealth Pool. This represents the character's gain in free 
		wealth beyond their means of support. i.e. their savings.
        <varlistentry><term>Status</term><listitem><para> The DF for a MAW or PAW</para></listitem></varlistentry>
        roll to determine whether or not the character gained in  
        Status. A succesful roll adds 1 to the Status Pool.
		Status is a rather subjective thing but typically, a 
        military career leads to increases in rank and possible minor fame. A 
        increase in status in a shadowy career would lead to the development 
        of a "Rep".  Most careers will have a status table that describes 
        the cost of a specific rank or status gain.

                        1 point, rank 1 costs 2 points , and so on. After characters have been generated they advance in
                        their skills according to rules described in the Players Guide. In summary single skills cost $

                    <para> The meaning of skill ranks varies somewhat based on the rarity of the skill and so on but, in
                        general, the skill ranks map to expertise according to table ~\ref{Table:SkillRanks} on
                        page~\pageref{Table:SkillRanks}. \include{tskill9} Someone is familiar with the skill if they
                        have tried it enough that the tools and techniques are known even if the character has no real
                        practice with them. A character is at a begginer level of skill if they have used the skills
                        enough to be comfortable with all the basic techniques needed even though they may not be
                        consistent in their execution. A character is at a dedicated amateur level of skill if they are
                        consistent in executing all the basic skills even though they have no real comfort with any of
                        the advanced techniques. A solid workaday craftsman is consistent and accomplished in executing
                        all the basic skills and are familiar with the advanced techniques and tools. A professional is
                        consistent and accomplished in te full range of basic and advanced techniques used in routine
                        application of the skill. An expert is consistent and accomplished in all the basic and advanced
                        techniques used in routine application of the skill as well as being familiar with techniques
                        and tools needed for less common usage of the skill. An master is consistent and accomplished in
                        all the techniques used in most applications of the skill. In addition they are familiar with
                        some esoteric techniques needed for bizarre and unusual applications of a skill. An character at
                        a mystical mastery level accomplished in all the techniques used in almost all known
                        applications of the skill. In addition they have a whole series of special techniques and tools

                        points, adding 2 costs 8 points, and so on. After characters have been generated they advance in
                        their stats according to rules described in the Players Guide. \input{tcgen4.tex} </para>

                    <title>Skill Packages</title>
                    <para> What we have discussed up till now has been single skills. Quite often the character will be
                        using a skill package. A skill package is a collection of related skills that have a bundled at
                        a bargain cost. A typical skill package would be : \begin{verbatim} Terran Law Enforcement
                        Officer Package Lore: Terran Law Culture Lore: Terran LEO Weapon: Pistol Weapon: Tonfa Weapon:
                        Taser Streetwise Interrogation Data Analysis Computer Ops Cost: 5 \end{verbatim} This package
                        would cost 5 points to get rank 0 in all the listed skills, 10 points to get rank 1 and so on.
                        This compares well to 9 points to get rank 0 in all the skills and 18 points to get rank 1 and
                        so on. After character generation, these skills are raised individually just like any other
                        skill according to rules described in the Players Guide. </para>

                    <title>Enhancements and Limitations</title>
                    <para> After a character has some points in the three pools associated with character creation (
                        personal, wealth, status) they may choose to use them to buy Enhancements that will add flavour
                        to the character. There are always the base enhancements allowed to the character. The points in
                        the personal pool can be used to buy skills at the generation cost. The points in the personal
                        pool can be used to buy stats at the costs listed in the stat cost tables. Enhancements are
                        gains in either background or special abilities that can be paid for with points from one of the
                        pools. There are two main types. There are Character Enhancements and there are Environmental
                        Enhancements. Character Enhancements are natural aptitudes that are typically permanent and
                        inherent to the character's makeup. Enhanced hearing or eidetic memory are examples of Character
                        Enhancements. Environmental Enhancements are typically advantages that depend on the character
                        to maintain them. Such as inherited wealth and various components of status. </para>

                        <para> Environmental Enhancements have both Depth and Scope to help govern their cost. Scope is
                            the number of people affected by the enhancement. <!--

Depth is how deeply they are affected by the enhancement.

--> So for determining the cost of a single ( Scope = $ 10^0$ ) friend willing to help you
                            all (Depth = Very High ) the time is simply $ 1 + 20 $. The DF describes how willing the
                            person is to help you. So in the example DF = 12 implies +60% to the chance for aid from
                            that person. </para>

                        <title>Wealth</title>
                        <para> The first and most commonly used is the wealth advantage. This differs from the basic
                            wealth that can be gained by spending the points from the wealth pool in that the gain is
                            approximately one third that of a pure monetary spend, but the gain so obtained is income
                            that will continue to be generated for as long as the PC pays attention to the interests
                            that generate the funds. The larger the income the more work involved in maintaining it. The
                            scale of the income is derived from table ~\ref{Table:EnvironmentalEnhancementScopeCosts}.
                            The amount of freedom from managing that income is given by the table

                            a given race. Some races have gifts or abilities as well as other trade-offs. For the most

                            of the culture. The character knows how to behave appropriate to their social class in the
                            culture. Each culture has standard sets of these templates. These templates are detailed in

                            character. There are some Tradeoffs that cost points to buy (Which can come out of any of
                            the pools) that give the character an Advantage of some sort. There are also Tradeoffs that

                                simple cost equal to 1/2 the purchase cost of the stats. So someone with a heightened
                                sense of smell would pay one half the cost of Physical Awareness (PAW) or 1/2 * 4 = 2$
                                for each additional point of increase. So someone with a 12 PAW could pay 8 points of

                                freedom from managing that income is given by the depth table </para>

                <title>The Occult</title>
                <para>Magic Is the ability to manipulate mana. Spell casters use their own internal energies to
                    manipulate Mana. It is not known where Mana comes from, but mana is generally all around us, it
                    flows and pool. The caster uses their own energy to raise, focus, and apply mana. The act of
                    raising, focusing and applying energy is called spell casting. That spellcasting can be very
                    unstructured all the way up to very structured.</para>
                <para>If you view mana as a kind of water then the very unstructured forms of spell casting are like
                    scooping the water up in your hands and splashing them at someone as opposed to creating dams and
                    dikes and pipes and hoses to deliver the water where you want to go. As you go from less structured
                    to more structured it takes less energy to achieve the same result while taking more time and often
                    requiring more care and detail work. The simplest form of casting are cantrips, which of the
                    equivalent of splashing water out of a pool with your hand. They are blazingly quick, not
                    particularly effective for anything beyond very small results like lighting a candle. The next form
                    is slightly more structured, and it is called sorcery. A sorcerer is kind of like a kid with a hand
                    pump who can pull up the water and direct it while dynamically changing with the circumstances so
                    that they can redirect the water at the drop of a hat. The next level up, Wizardry, is much more
                    structured but it does come in a range of complexities from simple structures with tightly focused
                    purposes (Squirt guns), to more general Complicated structures (household plumbing), all the way up
                    to monumental works (the Hoover dam)</para>
                <para>Many has types or flavours</para>
                <para>Each type of mana behaves in its own particular way especially when being manipulated by the
                    caster or when interacting with each other. Some of these ways are very logical. The magical element
                    of water is very effective in combating the magical element of fire. The magical element of fire
                    takes more work to control but produces more damage than the magical element of air. The magical
                    element of dark is diametrically opposed to the magical element of light. There are some energies
                    that human mages can barely get access to and even when they are casting with them they are often on
                    the edge of being out of control. There are also energies that are so phenomenally dangerous that
                    only the most powerful of mages can even attempt to work with them.</para>
                <para>Mana is often used in or generated by the activities of word or spirit, but never as aprimary part
                    of the activity.</para>

                    <para>The insanely dangerous energies. Chaos or Wild Magics. Wild magics are the magic of creation.
                        They are profoundly chaotic, almost impossible to control, and wildly powerful. The world is
                        designed so that the structure of the world prevents easy access to wild magics. Casting with
                        wild magic is very much like a human trying to redirect lightning with their bare hands. They
                        have a name for that type of spellcaster, the name is "fuse".</para>

                    <para>The sometimes I can cast with them energies The eternal energies are a set of energies that
                        are slow to summon, slippery to hold, hard to redirect, often difficult to banish and often have
                        lasting effects and echoes. In general even though they are actually highly ordered and
                        structured, that Order is rarely apparent to the spellcaster. These energies are known as
                        Belief, Stream, and Fabric</para>
                    <section>
                        <title>Belief</title>
                        <para>Belief is the energy generated by the exercise of faith. It is very difficult to get a
                            handle on and generally only the gods can reliably use it. This really is the power of
                            miracles. It can be cast and manipulated by mages and is used by priests and priestesses. It
                            despite that there is a fundamental difference between when a mage or priest attempts to
                            manipulate belief and when the divine is present. Don't make the mistake of believing that a
                            priest is simply a mage. A priest is a channel for their deity.</para>

                            as oracles can use it in much the same way that humans can ride a rhinoceros. You may be
                            physically able to do it, but you really don't have much ability to control the direction it
                            goes. Someone who is using Stream can see what is happened in the past (Generally much
                            easier than any other type of usage of Stream) as well as get a sense of what may be in the
                            future. In general the foreseeings done with Stream are highly influenced by the mental
                            state of the person doing the seeing. In other words, they often see the types of things
                            they would expect to see.</para>

                            and only the gods can reliably use it. But it is relatively easier to control spell castings
                            with Fabric. This is the energy associated with seeing things at a distance (clairvoyance)
                            as well as being associated with the Really cool spells like teleportation.</para>

                    <title>The Elementals</title>
                    <para>The bread-and-butter of most spell casters Elemental powers are fairly easy for a spellcaster
                        to get a handle on. The world is designed in such a way that mages have relatively easy access
                        to the elemental energies. They are generally fast to summon and easy to manipulate and behave
                        according to various rules and principles. They have their own kind of order and will behave in
                        predictable ways. Elemental energies are less likely to have lasting magical effects then the
                        Eternal energies and they can have have fairly lasting physical effects. Most creatures are
                        actually composed of a balance of the elemental energies in a dynamic balance. Too much exposure
                        to any one elemental energy can imbalance an individual and make them sick. One of the first
                        things that most spell casters learn is how to manipulate the energy without taking it into
                        themselves and thus unbalancing themselves. The elemental energies are:</para>

                        <simplelist>
                            <member>Fire - Fire is quick to summon hard to control or banish. Losing control usually
                                means something gets scorched. In general fire likes to do damage and consume
                                things.</member>
                            <member>Water - Water is less quick to summon, almost as hard to control as fire, but it is
                                rarely necessary to banish it because you can usually just let it dissipate and run off
                                itself. Water is harder to focus in order to damage.</member>
                            <member>Air - Air is quick to summon and hard to control or banish the losing control rarely
                                involves major damage. Air is very hard to focus in order to damage though it moves
                                quickly</member>
                            <member>Earth - Earth is slow to summon, hard to move, and slow to stop. Once going, Earth
                                can do a great deal of damage</member>
                            <member>Light - Light is quick to summon, easy to move, relatively easy to stop although you
                                do need to do it quickly. In general Light does not tend to do a great deal of damage
                                but it's side effects are often more significant ( temporarily blinding someone,
                                distracting someone etc.)</member>
                            <member>Dark - Dark is also quick to summon, easy to move and relatively easy to stop. Like
                                light it does not tend to do a great deal of damage but again its side effects are often
                                significant.</member>
                            <member>Life - Life energies are slightly slower to summon then light and dark, as well as
                                being very hard to focus on something. Life energies are lousy for doing damage with.
                                You can conceivably hit somebody with so much life that they are unbalanced. Life
                                energies are better for certain types of healings and divinations. They are very useful
                                for doing damage to creatures animated by deah such as the undead.</member>
                            <member>Death - Death energies are slightly slower to summon them light and dark, as well as
                                being very hard to focus on something. By the very nature Death energies are useful in
                                injuring living creatures. </member>

                                <member>Shadow - Shadow is normally a fleeting type of energy that is created by the
                                    interaction of light and dark. Sometimes you can find pools of shadow at twilight
                                    but generally it exists in those locations between light and dark. While shadow is
                                    not the most reliable of elemental materials it does have some advantages for
                                    several key actions: such as confusing a person's eyes, clouding their minds or
                                    causing fear. Shadow also has a "resonance" with other blocks of shadow. As a
                                    result, Shadow mages have easier access to the ability to walk from shadow to
                                    shadow.</member>
                                <member>Nature - "Life is, Nature will be". In general nature occurs where there is a
                                    preponderance of life and a small amount of death. There is a natural dynamically
                                    generated energy called nature. Nature is the energy that binds most living things
                                    to the natural order.</member>
                                <member>Shamans often deal with Nature. Decay - Decay occurs where there is a
                                    preponderance of death and a smaller amount of life. Decay is the energy that binds
                                    most Undead to that unnatural order.</member>

                    <para>Shamans live in two worlds, the world of flesh and the world of spirits. Since the world was
                        young there have been those who walked between both worlds, existing in both but belonging to
                        neither. It is a shaman’s job to serve both worlds. The shaman serves the spirit world by
                        helping keep a balance between the realm of spirit and the physical realm. The shaman usually
                        aids the spirits by performing rituals of cleansing, or performing rituals to thank the spirits
                        or offer the spirits his body to interact with this world for a short time. Spirits will often
                        grant boons for such services. Deals can also be made with spirits.</para>
                    <para>Shamans will often take on strange taboos which can last for month to years, or maybe his
                        entire life. If these taboos are broken then the shaman loses face in the eyes of the spirit
                        world. But remember, there must always be compensation. The way of the spirits is the way of
                        balance. There is always a cost for every service. Everything must balance in the end. That is
                        not to say that a shaman cannot do something from the goodness of his own heart, but that every
                        favor given is a favor owed and every gain comes with a loss. In the description of some of the

                        <title>Becoming a Shaman</title>
                        <para>They say the first step is the hardest, and this is especially true of shamans. In order
                            to become a shaman one must die first. When the shaman-to-be has a near-death experience
                            (whether intentional or not) and his soul leaves his body, he is met by a spirit guide. It
                            is the spirit guide’s duty to explain all that is expected of the shaman, the hardships he
                            may have to endure and that he will never again be truly a part of mortal society. The
                            spirit will not sugarcoat this, the shaman must be fully aware of what will become of him if
                            he makes this deal. If the deal is made, the guiding spirit becomes the shaman's totem
                            spirit and the shaman is given a permanent taboo, the first of many. The totem spirit will
                            teach the shaman what he needs to know to carry out his duties, and what his rewards will

                        <para>Shamans must honour at least one taboo to connect himself to his totem. This Taboo is a
                            life long Taboo. Taboos need not be difficult to fulfill, but it does make the shaman stand
                            out. All Shamans get -1 to Social stat. This negative does not count when dealing with the
                            spirits. If a shaman breaks a taboo he loses the favor of the spirit world. He still retains
                            the ability to interact with the spirit world but loses all bonuses and powers gained from
                            spirits, and none but the most corrupt and wicked spirits will deal with the shaman until
                            the shaman makes amends with the spirit whose taboo he broke.</para>

                            <para>While performing specific rituals, or while under the effect of certain drugs, the
                                shaman can see and hear the spirit world as vague shadows. Also, spirits can see through
                                to this world as a vague shadow, but shamans glow brightly for them. Once a spirit sees
                                a shaman, the spirits can then communicate with the shaman.</para>
                            <para>Only alcohol or natural drugs will allow the shaman to see the spirit world. Shamans
                                are immune to hallucinogenic or mind- altering effects of these drugs and alcohol
                                (though they may still suffer from slurred speech and lowered reflexes and reaction
                                time). Synthetic, man-made drugs will not allow the shaman to see the spirit world. The
                                shaman can look into the spirit world without the use of drugs or alcohol or without

                <title>The Occult</title>
                <para>Magic Is the ability to manipulate mana. Spell casters use their own internal energies to
                    manipulate Mana. It is not known where Mana comes from, but mana is generally all around us, it
                    flows and pool. The caster uses their own energy to raise, focus, and apply mana. The act of
                    raising, focusing and applying energy is called spell casting. That spellcasting can be very
                    unstructured all the way up to very structured. </para>
                <para>If you view mana as a kind of water then the very unstructured forms of spell casting are like
                    scooping the water up in your hands and splashing them at someone as opposed to creating dams and
                    dikes and pipes and hoses to deliver the water where you want to go. As you go from less structured
                    to more structured it takes less energy to achieve the same result while taking more time and often
                    requiring more care and detail work. The simplest form of casting are cantrips, which of the
                    equivalent of splashing water out of a pool with your hand. They are blazingly quick, not
                    particularly effective for anything beyond very small results like lighting a candle. The next form
                    is slightly more structured, and it is called sorcery. A sorcerer is kind of like a kid with a hand
                    pump who can pull up the water and direct it while dynamically changing with the circumstances so
                    that they can redirect the water at the drop of a hat. The next level up, Wizardry, is much more
                    structured but it does come in a range of complexities from simple structures with tightly focused
                    purposes (Squirt guns), to more general Complicated structures (household plumbing), all the way up
                    to monumental works (the Hoover dam)</para>
                <para>Many has types or flavours</para>
                <para> Each type of mana behaves in its own particular way especially when being manipulated by the
                    caster or when interacting with each other. Some of these ways are very logical. The magical element
                    of water is very effective in combating the magical element of fire. The magical element of fire
                    takes more work to control but produces more damage than the magical element of air. The magical
                    element of dark is diametrically opposed to the magical element of light. There are some energies
                    that human mages can barely get access to and even when they are casting with them they are often on
                    the edge of being out of control. There are also energies that are so phenomenally dangerous that
                    only the most powerful of mages can even attempt to work with them. </para>
                <para>Mana is often used in or generated by the activities of word or spirit, but never as aprimary part
                    of the activity.</para>

                        They are profoundly chaotic, almost impossible to control, and wildly powerful. The world is
                        designed so that the structure of the world prevents easy access to wild magics. Casting with
                        wild magic is very much like a human trying to redirect lightning with their bare hands. They
                        have a name for that type of spellcaster, the name is "fuse".</para>

                        are slow to summon, slippery to hold, hard to redirect, often difficult to banish and often have
                        lasting effects and echoes. In general even though they are actually highly ordered and
                        structured, that Order is rarely apparent to the spellcaster. These energies are known as
                        Belief, Stream, and Fabric</para>

                        <title>Belief</title>
                        <para> Belief is the energy generated by the exercise of faith. It is very difficult to get a
                            handle on and generally only the gods can reliably use it. This really is the power of
                            miracles. It can be cast and manipulated by mages and is used by priests and priestesses. It
                            despite that there is a fundamental difference between when a mage or priest attempts to
                            manipulate belief and when the divine is present. Don't make the mistake of believing that a
                            priest is simply a mage. A priest is a channel for their deity.</para>

                        <title>Stream</title>
                        <para>Stream is the energy of time and possibilities. Like belief is very difficult to get a
                            handle on and generally only the gods can reliably use it. Mages and shamans and others such
                            as oracles can use it in much the same way that humans can ride a rhinoceros. You may be
                            physically able to do it, but you really don't have much ability to control the direction it
                            goes. Someone who is using Stream can see what is happened in the past (Generally much
                            easier than any other type of usage of Stream) as well as get a sense of what may be in the
                            future. In general the foreseeings done with Stream are highly influenced by the mental
                            state of the person doing the seeing. In other words, they often see the types of things
                            they would expect to see.</para>

                            on and only the gods can reliably use it. But it is relatively easier to control spell
                            castings with Fabric. This is the energy associated with seeing things at a distance
                            (clairvoyance) as well as being associated with the Really cool spells like
                            teleportation.</para>

                    <title>The Elementals </title>
                    <para>The bread-and-butter of most spell casters Elemental powers are fairly easy for a spellcaster
                        to get a handle on. The world is designed in such a way that mages have relatively easy access
                        to the elemental energies. They are generally fast to summon and easy to manipulate and behave
                        according to various rules and principles. They have their own kind of order and will behave in
                        predictable ways. Elemental energies are less likely to have lasting magical effects then the
                        Eternal energies and they can have have fairly lasting physical effects. Most creatures are
                        actually composed of a balance of the elemental energies in a dynamic balance. Too much exposure
                        to any one elemental energy can imbalance an individual and make them sick. One of the first
                        things that most spell casters learn is how to manipulate the energy without taking it into
                        themselves and thus unbalancing themselves. The elemental energies are: </para>

                                means something gets scorched. In general fire likes to do damage and consume things. </member>
                            <member>Water - Water is less quick to summon, almost as hard to control as fire, but it is
                                rarely necessary to banish it because you can usually just let it dissipate and run off
                                itself. Water is harder to focus in order to damage. </member>

                            <member> Light - Light is quick to summon, easy to move, relatively easy to stop although
                                you do need to do it quickly. In general Light does not tend to do a great deal of
                                damage but it's side effects are often more significant ( temporarily blinding someone,
                                distracting someone etc.) </member>
                            <member>Dark - Dark is also quick to summon, easy to move and relatively easy to stop. Like
                                light it does not tend to do a great deal of damage but again its side effects are often
                                significant.</member>
                            <member> Life - Life energies are slightly slower to summon then light and dark, as well as
                                being very hard to focus on something. Life energies are lousy for doing damage with.
                                You can conceivably hit somebody with so much life that they are unbalanced. Life
                                energies are better for certain types of healings and divinations. They are very useful
                                for doing damage to creatures animated by deah such as the undead.</member>
                            <member> Death - Death energies are slightly slower to summon them light and dark, as well
                                as being very hard to focus on something. By the very nature Death energies are useful

                                    but generally it exists in those locations between light and dark. While shadow is
                                    not the most reliable of elemental materials it does have some advantages for
                                    several key actions: such as confusing a person's eyes, clouding their minds or
                                    causing fear. Shadow also has a "resonance" with other blocks of shadow. As a
                                    result, Shadow mages have easier access to the ability to walk from shadow to

                    <para>Shamans live in two worlds, the world of flesh and the world of spirits. Since the world was
                        young there have been those who walked between both worlds, existing in both but belonging to
                        neither. It is a shaman’s job to serve both worlds. The shaman serves the spirit world by
                        helping keep a balance between the realm of spirit and the physical realm. The shaman usually
                        aids the spirits by performing rituals of cleansing, or performing rituals to thank the spirits
                        or offer the spirits his body to interact with this world for a short time. Spirits will often
                        grant boons for such services. Deals can also be made with spirits. </para>
                    <para> Shamans will often take on strange taboos which can last for month to years, or maybe his
                        entire life. If these taboos are broken then the shaman loses face in the eyes of the spirit
                        world. But remember, there must always be compensation. The way of the spirits is the way of
                        balance. There is always a cost for every service. Everything must balance in the end. That is
                        not to say that a shaman cannot do something from the goodness of his own heart, but that every
                        favor given is a favor owed and every gain comes with a loss. In the description of some of the
                        shaman’s bonuses and rituals it mentions things like pure places or natural places. Anywhere it
                        says anything like this it means a place either taken back by nature and relatively left alone
                        by man, or places that man have never been. </para>

                        <title>Becoming a Shaman</title>
                        <para> They say the first step is the hardest, and this is especially true of shamans. In order
                            to become a shaman one must die first. When the shaman-to-be has a near-death experience
                            (whether intentional or not) and his soul leaves his body, he is met by a spirit guide. It
                            is the spirit guide’s duty to explain all that is expected of the shaman, the hardships he
                            may have to endure and that he will never again be truly a part of mortal society. The
                            spirit will not sugarcoat this, the shaman must be fully aware of what will become of him if
                            he makes this deal. If the deal is made, the guiding spirit becomes the shaman's totem
                            spirit and the shaman is given a permanent taboo, the first of many. The totem spirit will
                            teach the shaman what he needs to know to carry out his duties, and what his rewards will

                        <title>Constraints</title>
                        <para>Shamans must honour at least one taboo to connect himself to his totem. This Taboo is a
                            life long Taboo. Taboos need not be difficult to fulfill, but it does make the shaman stand
                            out. All Shamans get -1 to Social stat. This negative does not count when dealing with the
                            spirits. If a shaman breaks a taboo he loses the favor of the spirit world. He still retains
                            the ability to interact with the spirit world but loses all bonuses and powers gained from
                            spirits, and none but the most corrupt and wicked spirits will deal with the shaman until
                            the shaman makes amends with the spirit whose taboo he broke. </para>

                            <para> While performing specific rituals, or while under the effect of certain drugs, the
                                shaman can see and hear the spirit world as vague shadows. Also, spirits can see through
                                to this world as a vague shadow, but shamans glow brightly for them. Once a spirit sees
                                a shaman, the spirits can then communicate with the shaman. </para>
                            <para> Only alcohol or natural drugs will allow the shaman to see the spirit world. Shamans
                                are immune to hallucinogenic or mind- altering effects of these drugs and alcohol
                                (though they may still suffer from slurred speech and lowered reflexes and reaction
                                time). Synthetic, man-made drugs will not allow the shaman to see the spirit world. The
                                shaman can look into the spirit world without the use of drugs or alcohol or without
                                performing a ritual. </para>

                        <para>athering the energy is a fundamental part of the casting process. Most spells will use the
                            mage's internal energy to summon and manipulate the specific type of energy needed. How well
                            a character can access their own power is governed by their PSI stat. Using the power to
                            gather energy expends Mental Fatigue. This MFT can be supplemented by energy from Material
                            Components, Magic Items, Living Sacrifice, Worship, Physical Exertion, or just by being
                            given the energy by another. The skill used in gathering the energy is Manipulate Energy. An
                            ME skill is needed for each type of energy to be manipulated. ME: skills such as ME:Fire can
                            be used to make perception rolls for detecting the energy in question. A perception skill
                            for a specific energy type can be used to determine the intensity and extent of the
                            energy.</para>

                        <para>In focusing the energy the caster directs and channels the energies toward a specific end.
                            Material components used during this part of the spell would be used for channeling the
                            energies involved \footnote{ Material Component could be damaged (magically) if it cannot
                            contain the energies involved}. Somatic and verbal components add to this part of the spell
                            process as does any meditative state or trance.. The mage determines how much energy will be
                            applied at this point. The time taken in focusing the energies is spent in setting up the
                            various actions to be performed by the energy. The time spent in applying the energy is
                            fairly constant compared to the time spent focusing the energies.</para>

                            caster may partake of will be considered florentine actions. Passive Concentration duration
                            spells last for as long as the caster is concious and or clear minded. Permanent spells last
                            until dispelled or disrupted. Spells that have a numeric duration buy the scale and value of
                            the duration. By default the scale is in pulses and the value is the mage's PSI. .</para>

                        the energy being used. Normally, invested items can resist. With sufficient preparation the
                        resistance can be dropped to 0. Warding rituals are similiar. \section{Spell Design Tables}

                    <title>The flow of casting.</title>
                    <para>There are three steps in any manipulation of mana. (whether it be cantrip, spell, ritual or
                        rite). The first is gathering the energy, the second is focusing that energy and the third is
                        releasing it.</para>
                    <section>
                        <title>Gathering</title>
                        <para>athering the energy is a fundamental part of the casting process. Most spells will use the
                            mage's internal energy to summon and manipulate the specific type of energy needed. How well
                            a character can access their own power is governed by their PSI stat. Using the power to
                            gather energy expends Mental Fatigue. This MFT can be supplemented by energy from Material
                            Components, Magic Items, Living Sacrifice, Worship, Physical Exertion, or just by being
                            given the energy by another. The skill used in gathering the energy is Manipulate Energy. An
                            ME skill is needed for each type of energy to be manipulated. ME: skills such as ME:Fire can
                            be used to make perception rolls for detecting the energy in question. A perception skill
                            for a specific energy type can be used to determine the intensity and extent of the
                            energy.</para>

                        <title>Focusing</title>
                        <para>In focusing the energy the caster directs and channels the energies toward a specific end.
                            Material components used during this part of the spell would be used for channeling the
                            energies involved \footnote{ Material Component could be damaged (magically) if it cannot
                            contain the energies involved}. Somatic and verbal components add to this part of the spell
                            process as does any meditative state or trance.. The mage determines how much energy will be
                            applied at this point. The time taken in focusing the energies is spent in setting up the
                            various actions to be performed by the energy. The time spent in applying the energy is
                            fairly constant compared to the time spent focusing the energies.</para>

                    <title>Casting Types</title>
                    <para>Spell types Spells vary in their complexity and in the time it takes to cast them. There are
                        special names for spell casts of a given complexity and cast time. Those names are Sorceries,
                        Cantrips, Spells, Rituals and Rites.</para>
                    <section>
                        <title>Cantrips</title>
                        <para>Cantrips are simple magicks. They are simple in structure and low powered. Often simple
                            material components will supply the power needed. A caster casting cantrips needs to have a
                            skill in Casting:Cantrips in order to be considered ranked in the action they are
                            attempting.</para>

                            are generally fairly flexible.</para>

                        <para>Spells are ritualized sorceries. They have a structure and effect that are determined when
                            they are designed. Thus a caster using a ``Throw Fire'' spell may only vary the specific
                            effects of the spell taht are designed to be varied.</para>

                        <para>A ritual is a highly structured and detailed spell that involves the manipulation of more
                            than one mages worth of energy at a time. In order to do this the caster must gather power
                            from some outside source. To cast rituals requires the Hold Energy skill for energy type
                            being used.</para>

                        <member>Resistance (RES). Resistance is how easily can the spell be resisted. The higher this
                            value is the better it is for the caster. When doing spell design the designer will be
                            modifying Resistance. When the spell design is complete the value for RES will be used to
                            generate the Resistance Difficulty Factor (RDF) inlineequation 1. Resistence RDF = 7 -
                            Resistance</member>
                        <member>Quantitative Effect (QE). A quantitative value for the total effect a spell can have. QE
                            is a numeric constant. This is translated to actual effect via a table. For Damage or
                            Restoration spells this directly translates as the damage done by the spell.</member>

                        <member>Energy Cost (EC). The Energy Cost is the amount of Mental Fatigue used to cast the spell
                            from start to finish.</member>
                        <member>Casting Time (CT). Casting Time is the time taken in pulses or any appropriate time
                            unit. More casting time is lower cost, less casting time is higher cost.</member>

                        <para>Duration(DUR). Duration is the length of time that the effect of the spell lasts. An
                            Instaneous spell lasts for a very small and fleeting duration. Active Concentration duration
                            spells last for as long as the caster concenmtrates on the spell. Any other actions the
                            caster may partake of will be considered florentine actions. Passive Concentration duration
                            spells last for as long as the caster is concious and or clear minded. Permanent spells last
                            until dispelled or disrupted. Spells that have a numeric duration buy the scale and value of
                            the duration. By default the scale is in pulses and the value is the mage's PSI. .</para>

                    <para>A spell is designed by starting with 25 + Mages MST in SDP. All spell statistics are 0. CDF =
                        0, Resistance = 0; DUR = 0; RNG = 0; QE = 0; EC = 0.</para>
                    <para>A {\it Laser} spell is designed as follows.</para>

                    <para>Now let us design another spell. We will design a {\it Lightnings Hand} spell. We specify
                        multiple targets. \section{Other Notes that are of interest} Investment Rituals are specific to
                        the energy being used. Normally, invested items can resist. With sufficient preparation the
                        resistance can be dropped to 0. Warding rituals are similiar. \section{Spell Design Tables}
