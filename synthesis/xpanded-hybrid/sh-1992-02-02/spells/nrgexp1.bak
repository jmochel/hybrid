Mana isthe internal energy used by all spell casters to manipulate energy.How well a character can access their own power is governed by theirPSI or MAP stat.The power of the caster is used to raise, focus, and apply energy.MFT is expended during the use of power. Power itself is neverdirectly measured in \SH\ .  Various Manipulate Energy skills (ME:)are needed to control the energy.  ME: skills such as ME:Fire can beused to make perception rolls for detecting the energy in question.A perception skill for a specific energy type can be used to determinethe intensity and extent of the energy.Spells cost as Tech Ops. Ritual design is an Engineering Skill.Perception skills are Mental Disciplines.The diagram below details out the relationship between Power and the other energiesavailable for manipulation\footnote{What about Electricity and general force ? }.\begin{picture}(4in,4in)\put(2,3.8){World View of Energy}\put(.5,3.5){\framebox{Eternals}\put(.5,3.0){Belief}\put(.5,2.8){Fabric}\put(.5,2.6){Stream}\put(2,3.5){\framebox{Elements}\put(2,3.0){Fire}\put(2,2.8){Water}\put(2,2.6){Air}\put(2,2.4){Earth}\put(2,2.2){Light}\put(2,2.0){Dark}\put(2,1.8){Life}\put(2,1.6){Death}\put(3.5,3.5){\framebox{Ephemerals}\put(3.5,2.2){Starlight}\put(3.5,2.0){Shadow}\put(3.5,1.8){Nature}\put(3.5,1.6){Decay}\end{picture}\section{Power}Power is the energy that exists in and around living creatures.  It isfast to summon (when it comes from internal sources ). Power is easilymanipulated at an intuitive level. Power will readily form simple andfragile patterns. Those patterns are disrupted by the flow of otherenergies in the area. Most power has a personal flavor to it.\section{Eternals}Eternal Energies are slow to summon, hard to redirect, difficult tobanish, usually leave lasting effects and echos, and are highlyordered. The highly ordered nature of the energie may not be readilyapparent to a spellcaster.\section{Elementals}Elemental powers are faster to summon than the eternals and easier tomanipulate. Elemental powers are ordered at a level that is sometimesapparent to most casters. Elemental energies are less likely to havelasting magical effects then the Eternal energies. Elemental energieshave fairly lasting physical effects.\section{Ephemerals}The Ephemerals are easily and quickly summoned, easily manipulated and quick to fade. They are ordered at a level far lower than most casters canperceive. \chapter{Spell Casting}\section{Raising Power}\section{Focusing Power}\section{Applying Power}\chapter{Spell Formats}\section{Rituals}\section{Cantrips}\section{Spells}\chapter{Spell Design}\section{Factors in Spell Design}\section{Spell Attributes}\section{Basic Rules of Spell Design}\end{document}
