First, roll against Perception. If the perception roll is successful, the 
Initiative roll is 

	\[Initiative =  2d10 - {Unengaged Speed}\].

If the character has a preset reaction and the perception roll is 
successful the Initiative roll is

	\[Initiative =  2d10 - {Engaged Speed}  - 2 \times {Rank Speed} \]

If the perception roll is failed the Initiative roll is 

	\[Initiative =  2d10 \].

Once the character is past the first Initiative roll, the Initiative roll
is 

	\[Initiative =  2d10 - {Engaged Speed}  - {Rank Speed} \]
