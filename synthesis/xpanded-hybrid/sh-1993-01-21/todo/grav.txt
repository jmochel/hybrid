Hi Folks,
	While I was tracking down some data I came across some interesting
notes about the effects of accellaration. Just thought I would share it
for those who work with Space Games.

1g	Terran Norm
2g	Hands and feet are heavy and climbing is difficult but not
	impossible.

3g	Walking And Climbing Impossible , Crawling almost Impossible
5g	Only slight movements of arms and head possible

3.5	-	8.0	g's Blackout
4.0	-	8.5	g	Confusion, unconciousness

And fo those of you that enjoy the sensational, William Beding
survived 83g of accellaration for 0.1 seconds . He only had a headache
and was shaken up for a while afterwords.

(I can't believe they found someone to voluteer for that one !!!! )
