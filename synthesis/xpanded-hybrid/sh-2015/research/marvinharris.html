<H1>Marvin Harris</H1>
<p align = "right"><IMG SRC="harris10.jpg"><br>
1927 - 2001</p>


<p>
Update: <b>Marvin Harris</b> died on October 25, 2001. The <em>New York Times</em> obituary includes the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<hr>
Dr. Harris, who called his approach "cultural materialism," was an anthropology professor at Columbia University from 1953 until 1980, including three years as department chairman. From 1980 until 2000, he held a graduate research professorship at the University of Florida. 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
But his provocative ideas, and equally provocative presentation, gave him a sphere of influence greatly exceeding that of an ordinary academic. Many of his 17 books were aimed at general audiences. 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
The Hindu ban on killing cows? Absolutely necessary as a strategy of human existence, Dr. Harris contended: they are much more valuable for plowing fields and providing milk than as a one-time steak dinner.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
"Westerners think that Indians would rather starve than eat their cows," he told Psychology Today. "What they don't understand is that they will starve if they do eat their cows."
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
In Dr. Harris's view, then, a manufactured "divine intervention" was needed to encourage people simply to do the practical thing.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
The Jewish and Muslim bans on eating pork? Pigs eat the same foods as humans, he reasoned, and are expensive to keep. Sheep, goats and cattle, by contrast, thrive on grass, and provide wool, milk and labor. 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Warfare? A way of curbing population when protein gets scarce. Neckties? A badge men wear to indicate they are above physical labor.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Witchcraft? A convenient culprit for the rising protest that church and state faced from the 15th century to the 17th. 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Dr. Harris's zest for controversy was suggested by the title of an article he wrote for The New York Times Magazine in 1977: "Why Men Dominate Women." So was his contention that Aztec cannibalism sprang from a need for protein sufficiency, a view that drew some strong opposition. "It takes an heroic act of utilitarian faith to conclude that this sacrificial system was a way the Aztecs had for getting more meat," Marshall Sahlins wrote in The New York Review of Books in 1978.
<hr>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course what Douglas Martin, the author of the obituary neglects to reveal is that Harris believed that Sahlins distorted cultural materialism, and Harris later <a href = "javascript:alert(harris);">strongly criticized</a> Sahlins's obscurantism in <em>Cultural Materialism</em>. But then, Harris has never been the media darling that Claude Levi-Strauss (Sahlins was a spokesman for the work of Levi-Strauss, according to Harris) and E.O. Wilson and other non-cultural materialists have been. 
And he also fails to mention the fact that field studies increasingly support Harris's theories on the widespread and varied cases - and causes - of cannibalism worldwide.
</p>
<p>
<b>R. Brian Ferguson</b>, currently one of the foremost proponents of cultural materialism commented about the <em>Times</em> obituary:<br>
<blockquote>
...it leaves out 80% of him--his dedication to making anthropology a science, his perserverance as a generalist while all else were specializing, his opposition to biological reductionism when most anthropologists were ignoring it, his never-ending
effort to grapple with issues of modern society, from "America Now" to the
collapse of the  USSR, and a political committment which in the obituary,
sounds like crankiness.
<p align = "right">personal correspondence, October 30, 2001</p>

</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Cultural Materialism is 
<blockquote><font color="000888">
"...based on the simple premise that human social life is a response to the practical problems of earthly existence..." (<i>Cultural Materialism: The Struggle for a Science of Culture</i>)</blockquote></font>

<p>Cultural Materialism is one of the most important ideas developed in the 20th Century, although its importance will not be recognized until the 21st. Its fundamental premise - that all human culture is shaped most significantly by the environment in which humans live - is so elegant, so parsimonious, and so superior to competing paradigms that it is frankly amazing that cultural materialism is not more widely accepted. It is particularly dismaying that cultural materialism is not better known because Marvin Harris has been publishing excellent text books, scholarly volumes, and books for general audiences since the 1960s. His most popular books include <i>Cows, Pigs, Wars and Witches</i> and <i>Cannibals and Kings</i> and his most recent publication, <i>Our Kind</i>.

<p>
Throughout his books, Marvin Harris uses cultural materialist theories to explain a wide variety of cultural phenomenon including food taboos, Christianity, male supremacy and warfare. A good example is this discussion, in <i>Cannibals and Kings</i> of the phenomenon of the sacred cow in India:
<blockquote><font color="000888">
The tabooing of beef was the cumulative result of the individual decisions of millions and millions of farmers, some of whom were better able than others to resist the temptation of slaughtering their livestock because they strongly believed that the life of a cow or an ox was a holy thing. Those who held such beliefs were much more likely to hold onto their farms, and to pass them on to their children, than those who believed differently... Under the periodic duress of droughts caused by failures of the monsoon rains, the individual farmer's love of cattle translated directly into love of human life, not by symbol but by practice. Cattle had to be treated like human beings because human beings who ate their cattle were one step away from eating each other. To this day, monsoon farmers who yield to temptation and slaughter their cattle seal their doom. They can never plow again even when the rains fall. They must sell their farms and migrate to the cities. Only those who would starve rather than eat an ox or cow can survive a season of scanty rains.</blockquote></font>

<p><font color="000000">
A comprehensive analysis of cultural materialism can be found in Marvin Harris's master work <i>Cultural Materialism - The Struggle for a Science of Culture</i> published in 1979. The book has two functions - to explain cultural materialism, and to critique competing theories.


<p><font color="000000">
<b>Theoretical Principles of Cultural Materialism</b>
<ul>
<li><strong><font color="#000888">Infrastructural determinism</font></strong> <font color="000000">-"human beings must expend energy to obtain energy (and other life-sustaining products.) And like all bioforms, our ability to produce children is greater than our ability to obtain energy for them." Cultural materialism is opposed to theories that say that thoughts and words have more influence on culture than the physical realities of existence.</li><br><br>

<li><strong><font color="#000888">Bio-Psychological Constants</font></strong> <font color="000000"> -<ol>
<li> People need to eat and will generally opt for diets that offer more rather than fewer calories and proteins and other nutrients.</li>
<li>People cannot be totally inactive, but when confronted with a given task, they prefer to carry it out by expending less rather than more energy.</li>
<li>People are highly sexed and generally find reinforcing pleasure from sexual intercourse -- more often from heterosexual intercourse.</li>
<li>People need love and affection in order to feel secure and happy, and other things being equal, they will act to increase the love and affection which others give them.
</ol>
</li><br>
<li><strong><font color="#000888">The Significance of Food Production and Human Reproduction</font></strong> <font color="000000">-cultural materialism recognizes the interplay between nutrition and population, and their driving role in warfare and technological innovation. It does not avoid examining the methods used by pre-technological cultures to control population, including female malnutrition, crude abortion techniques and infanticide.</li><br><br>
</ul>

<p><b>Alternatives to Cultural Materialism</b><br>
The competing anthropological theories are identified in the second half of the book as:
<ul>
<li><b>Sociobiology and Biological Reductionism</b> - "a research strategy that seeks to explain human social life by means of the theoretical principles of Darwinian and neo-Darwinian evolutionary biology... Cultural materialists of course accept neo-Darwinist principles when applied to the explanation of social life of infrahuman species, but we insist that the same principles are capable of explaining only an insignificant proportion of human sociocultural differences and similarities."<br>
Sociobiology is currently very poplar in American mass media, and is often cited as proof that that men are "naturally" polygamous and women are "naturally" monogamous. But as Harris notes:
<blockquote>
The idea that males naturally desire a plurality of sexual experiences while women are satisfied by one mate at a time is entirely a product of the political-economic domination males have exerted over women as part of the culturally created, warfare-related male supremacy complex. Sexually adventurous women are severely punished in male-dominated cultures. Wherever women have enjoyed independent wealth and power, however, they have sought to fulfill themselves with multiple mates with no less vigor than males in comparable situations. I cannot image a weaker instance of genetic programming than the polygyny of <i>Homo sapiens</i>. Sexuality is something people can be socialized out of only at great cost. But people can be socialized into and out of promiscuity, polygyny, polyandry, and monogamy with conspicuous ease, once the appropriate infrastructural conditions are present.</blockquote>
</li><br>

<li><b>Dialectical Materialism</b> - Cultural materialists agree with dialectical materialists - often known as Marxists - on the importance of infrastructure. But cultural materialists reject the dialectical view of history developed by philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, which plays a central role in Marxist theories.</li><br><br>

<li><b>Structuralism</b> - In spite of the proponents of structuralism declarations of the primacy of the infrastructure, structuralism places more importance on words and ideas. Additionally, structuralism resists scientific method:
<blockquote>
Part of the appeal of structuralism is precisely that it permits armchair anthropologists to work with collections of myths or kinship terminologies in libraries far removed from the live context in which the data were originally collected. "To discover hidden meanings is what structural analysis aims at" (Maquett, 1974:123). What can be more delightful than to discover hidden meanings that no one can dispute?</blockquote></p>

<p>One of the joys or reading Harris is his irreverence. The heading for the section on the corpus of structuralist theory is entitled <i>The Raw, the Cooked, and the Half-Baked</i> a play on Structuralism founder Claude Levi-Strauss's <i>The Raw and the Cooked</i>.</li><br><br>

<li><b>Structural Marxism</b> - "...combining aspects of structuralism with aspects of dialectical and historical materialism. Structural Marxists heap scorn on cultural materialists as 'mechanical,' 'vulgar,' and 'so-called Marxists.'"</li><br><br>

<li><b>Psychological and Cognitive Idealism</b> - "An adversary situation exists between cultural materialism and cognitivist and psychological strategies only when cognitivists and psychological anthropologists claim that the mental, emic, and personality espects of sociocultural systems determine the etic and behavior aspects..." Harris illustrates the differences this way: "war is not caused by the Oedipus complex" (as psychological/cognitive theories have it) "rather, the Oedipus complex is caused by war."</li><br><br>

<li><b>Eclecticism</b> "By picking and choosing epistemological and theoretical principles to suit the convenience of each puzzle, eclecticism guarantees that its solutions will remain unrelated to each other by any coherent set of principles."</li><br><br>

<li><b>Obscurantism</b> - "Obscurantism is a research strategy whose aim is to subvert the possibility of achieving a science of human social life" Harris names Carlos Castanedas and Marshall Sahlins as purveyors of the anti-scientific, morally opaque approach to culture.</li><br><br>
