<p><font face="Arial"><b><font color="#008080" size="6">M</font><font size="5">aterialism</font>, as an approach
to understanding cultural systems, is defined by three key principles, cultural
materialism, cultural evolution, and cultural ecology, and can be traced back at least to
the early economists, Karl Marx and Frederick Engels (see Principal Concepts).</b></font> </p>

<p><font face="Arial"><b>These basic premises, defined below, have in common attempts at explaining cultural
similarities and differences and modes for culture change in a strictly scientific manner.
In addition, these three concepts all share a materialistic view of culture change. That
is to say, each approach holds that there are three levels within culture ---
technological, sociological, and ideological --- and that the technological aspect of
culture disproportionately molds and influences the other two aspects of culture.</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><b><font color="#408080">Materialism</font> is the &quot;idea that technological
and economic factors play the primary role in molding a society&quot; (Carneiro 1981:218).
There are many varieties of materialism including dialectical (Marx), historical (White),
and cultural (Harris). Though materialism can be traced as far back as Hegel, an early
philosopher, Marx was the first to apply materialistic ideas to human societies in a
quasi-anthropological manner. Marx developed the concept of dialectical materialism
borrowing his dialectics from Hegel and his materialism from others. To Marx, &quot;the <font
color="#408080">mode of production</font> in material life determines the general
character of the social, political, and spiritual processes of life. It is not the
consciousness of men that determines their existence, but on the contrary, their social
existence determines their consciousness&quot; (Harris 1979:55). The dialectic element of
Marx&#146;s approach is in the feedback or interplay between the infrastructure (i.e.,
resources, economics), the structure (i.e., politcal makeup, kinship), and the
superstructure (i.e., religion, ideology). The materialistic aspect or element of
Marx&#146;s approach is in the emphasis placed on the infrastructure as a primary
determinate of the other levels (i.e., the structure and the superstructure). In other
words, explanations for culture change and cultural diversity are to be found in this
primary level (i.e., the infrastructure).</b></font> </p>

<p><font face="Arial"><b>Marvin Harris, utilizing and modifying Marx's dialectical materialism, developed the
concept of <font color="#408080">cultural materialism.</font> Like Marx and White,
Harris also views culture in three levels, the infrastructure, the structure, and the
superstructure. The infrastructure is composed of the mode of production, or &quot;the
technology and the practices employed for expanding or limiting basic subsistence
production,&quot; and the <font color="#408080">mode of reproduction</font>, or
&quot;the technology and the practices employed for expanding, limiting, and maintaining
population size&quot; (Harris 1979:52). Unlike Marx, Harris believes that the mode of
reproduction, that is demography, mating patterns, etc., should also be within the level
of the infrastructure because &quot;each society must behaviorally cope with the problem
of reproduction (by) avoiding destructive increases or decreases in population size&quot;
(Harris 1979:51). The structure consists of both the domestic and political economy, and
the superstructure consists of the recreational and aesthetic products and services. Given
all of these cultural characteristics, Harris states that &quot;the etic behavioral modes
of production and reproduction probabilistically determine the etic behavioral domestic
and political economy, which in turn probabilistically determine the behavioral and mental
emic superstructures&quot; (Harris 1979:55,56). The above concept is cultural materialism
or, in Harris' terms, the principle of infrastructural determinism.</b></font> </p>

<p><font face="Arial"><b><font color="#408080">Cultural evolution</font>, in a Marxian sense, is the idea
that &quot;cultural changes occur through the accumulation of small, quantitative
increments that lead, once a certain point is reached, to a qualitative
transformation&quot; (Carneiro 1981:216). Leslie White is usually given credit for
developing and refining the concept of general cultural evolution and was heavily
influenced by Marxian economic theory as well as Darwinian evolutionary theory. To White,
&quot;culture evolves as the amount of energy harnessed per captia per year is increased,
or as the efficiency of the instrumental means of putting the energy to work is
increased&quot; (Bohannan and Glazer 1988:340). Energy capture is accomplished through the
technological aspect of culture so that a modification in technology could, in turn, lead
to a greater amount of energy capture or a more efficient method of energy capture thus
changing culture. In other words, &quot;we find that progress and development are effected
by the improvement of the mechanical means with which energy is harnessed and put to work
as well as by increasing the amounts of energy employed&quot; (Bohannan and Glazer
1988:344). Another premise that White adopts is that the technological system plays a
primary role or is the primary determining factor within the cultural system. White's
materialist approach is evident in the following quote: &quot;man as an animal species,
and consequently culture as a whole, is dependent upon the material, mechnaical means of
adjustment to the natural environment&quot; (Bohannan and Glazer 1988).</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><b>Juliand Steward developed the principal of <font color="#408080">cultural ecology</font>
which holds that the environment is an additional, contributing factor in the shaping of
cultures. Steward termed his approach <font color="#408080">multilinear evolution,
</font>and
defined it as &quot;a methodology concerned with regularity in social change, the goal of
which is to develop cultural laws empirically&quot; (Bohannan and Glazer 1988:321). In
essence, Steward proposed that, methodologically, one must look for &quot;parallel
developments in limited aspects of the cultures of specifically identified societies&quot;
(Hoebel1958:90). Once parallels in development are identified, one must then look for
similiar causal explanations. Steward also developed the idea of culture types that have
&quot;cross-cultural validity and show the following characteristics: (1) they are made up
of selected cultural elements rather than cultures as wholes; (2) these cultural elements
must be selected in relationship to a problem and to a frame of reference; and (3) the
cultural elements that are selected must have the same functional relationships in every
culture fitting the type&quot; (Bohannan and Glazer 1988:321).</b></font> </p>

<p><font face="Arial"><b><a name="Points of Reaction"></a><font color="#800000" size="4">Points of Reaction</font></b></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><b>Materialism, in anthropology, is methodologically and theoretically opposed to
Idealism. Included in the latter are culture and personality or psychological
anthropology, structuralism, ethnoscience, and symbolic anthropology. The many advocates
of this idealistic approach &quot;share an interest in psychological phenomena, and they
tend to view culture in mental and symbolic terms&quot; (Langness 1974:84).
&quot;Materialists, on the other hand, tend to define culture strictly in terms of overt,
observable behavior patterns, and they share the belief that technoenvironmental factors
are primary and causal&quot; (Langness 1974:84). The contemporaneous development of these
two major points of view allowed for scholarly debate on which approach was the most
appropriate in the study of culture.</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><b><a name="Principal Concepts"></a><font color="#800000" size="4">Principal Concepts</font></b></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><b><font color="#408080">Mode of Production:</font> &quot;a specific, historically
constituted combination of resources, technology, and social and economic relationships,
creating use or exchange value&quot; (Winthrop 1991:189). This concept was initially
defined and refined by Marx and Engels. For these economists, a &quot;mode of production
must not be considered simply as being the production of the physical existence of the
individuals. Rather, it is a definite form of activity of these individuals, a definite
form of expressing thier life, a definite mode of life on their part&quot; (Winthrop
1991:190). With respect to specific, historical, precapitalist socities, the mode of
production manifests as a combination or interplay between individuals, their material
enviroment, and their mode of labor.</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><b>A similar definition proposed by Maurice Godelier, an anthropologist, states that the
mode of production is &quot;a combination -- which is capable of reproducing itself -- of
production forces and specific social relations of production which determine the
structure and form of the process of production and the circulation of material goods
within a historically determined society&quot; (Winthrop 1991:190). In addition, a
particular society is not restricted to one particular mode of production; that is to say,
&quot;any given society at a particular historical juncture may involve multiple modes of
production in a specified articulation&quot; (Winthrop 1991:190).</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><b>Winthrop notes that this particular concept (i.e., as defined above), though discussed
often, is not consistently applied. Particularly with respect to cultural evolution and
cultural materialism, the application of the concept differs from the above definitions in
two ways: (1) &quot;most evolutionary studies assume that a social form can be
characterized by its technology, that is, that technological processes determine economic
relations&quot; and (2) &quot;such studies treat each society in terms of a single mode of
production&quot; (Winthrop 1991:191).</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><b><font color="#408080">Law of Cultural Development</font>: &quot;culture advances
as the amount of energy harnessed per captia per year increases, or as the efficiency or
economy of the means of controlling enery is increased, or both&quot; (White 1959:56).</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><b><font color="#408080">Culturology: </font>the field of science which studies and
interprets the distinct order of phenomena termed culture (White 1959:28). This term was
developed by Leslie White because he believed that cultures should be explained, not in
terms of pyschology, biology, physiology, etc., but in terms of culturology (i.e., the
study of culture). During this time in anthropology, the notion of society was being
developed and becoming a key focus of study. White believed that the primary focus of
study in anthropology should be culture and not society. In addition, explanations for
cultural development and change should come from anthropology and methodological approach
should be scientific.</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><b><font color="#408080">General Cultural Evolution:</font> &quot;the successive
emergence of new levels of all-round development&quot; (Sahlins and Service 1988:28). To
White and others, general evolution is based on the amount of energy capture and deals
with &quot;C&quot;ulture, per se. Again, quoting White, &quot;culture advances as the
proportion of nonhuman energy to human energy increases&quot; (1959:47). In addition, this
concept is characterized by the progression from lower to higher orders of organization.
In other words, changes in the complexity and organization of cultural forms is a result
of changes in the amount of engergy capture. When general evolution is discussed, culture
is viewed as a closed system. &quot;That is, culture is taken out of particular and
historic contexts&quot; (Sahlins and Service 1959:46).</b></font> </p>

<p><font face="Arial"><b><font color="#408080">Specific Cultural Evolution:</font> the historical
sequence of particular cultures and their lines of development. Unlike general cultural
evolution, specific evolution is based on the efficiency of energy capture with respect to
specific cultures. That is to say, a particular culture in a given envirnoment maybe less
complex, both technologically and socially, in the general evolutionary scheme; however,
this particular culture may, at the same time, be the best adapted (i.e., most efficient
at harnessing energy) to their environment. This concept is analogous to biological
evoultion, in that, specific evolution can be viewed as historical, phylogentic lines of
descent (Sahlins and Service 1959:16). General evolution, on the other hand, can be viewed
as ordered complexity of living organisims.</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><b><font color="#408080">Law of Cultural Growth:</font> &quot;culture develops as
the efficiency or economy of the means of controlling energy increases, other factors
remaining constant&quot; (White 1959:55).</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><b><font color="#408080">Culture Core</font>: &quot;the constellation of features
which are most closely related to subsistence activities and economic arrangements&quot;
(Winthrop 1991:47). This concept was developed by Juliand Steward in his 1955 publication
&quot;Theory of Culture Change.&quot;</b></font> </p>

<p><font face="Arial"><b>The method of <font color="#408080">Cultural Ecology</font> &quot;has three
aspects: (1)the analysis of the methods of production in the environment must be analyzed,
and (2)the pattern of human behavior that is part of these methods must be analyzed in
order to (3) understand the relationship of production techniques to the other elements of
the culture&quot; (Bohannan and Glazer 1988:322).</b></font></p>
