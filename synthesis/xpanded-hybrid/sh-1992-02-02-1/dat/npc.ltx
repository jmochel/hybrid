 Anilram is a shrewed and dangerous man. He will not let any of the oher
churches get in the way of his work. But his pride is his one weakness. He is	
long haired, with a flowing white beard. Blue eyes and he is missing one hand.

{\em Comment}\\
Shivarra is in many ways a typical Moonsinger. She is sympathetic,		
friendly and ruthless. She has joined with Koreal and Ezra's group because she  
is fond of Finrin and because it allows her to learn more of her enemies. 

She is of the Kevar royal line and has some spiritual authority as a result.

 Has respect for life insofar as it is a commodity for which people will
exchange money. Spent some time in a local militia before being inducted into	
the Guild.  Believes in no particular power except the presence of death.		
Considers assassination to be the highest of art forms and the most noble of	
callings.  The cleaner the job, the better.  He despises bullies, although he is
not beyond bulling himself if it will suit his ends.  He also believes in law	
and order.  While he appreciates a job done without unnecessary violence, he is 
also cognizant of the value of intimidation.

{\em Comment}\\
A DANGEROUS ADVERSARY. A HONORARY MEMBER OF THE DROW OF THE SILVER		
LIVES. HE IS KNOWN IN ROKE AS TOO CHAOTIC FOR THEIR LAW. BANNED FROM ROKE AND	
CULMAIEA. HIS EXISTENCE PUZZLES THE MIMBRATE BECAUSE HE IS LOWBORN AND A
GREATSWORDSMAN. He is the son of a lordless landless peasant.
He is a hard bitten pragmatic man. He expects payment, either
in material, people, labor, or improvement in his own skill.
{\em History}\\
Thrown out of his birthplace by the lord of the region for 
being visibly mageborn. Trained as a Diviner under Derian Altou.
His mentor was killed and he was enslaved by Orcs. He became a skilled 
slave gladiator and escaped seven years later. He wandered the Kasan desert and
the southern wastes for 12 years. When he came back he was self trained as
a battle mage and psychic. He has since simply drifted from village to village. 
Taking pay to destroy the creatures left over from the cataclysm. He has
a simple keep in the Wind Hills populated by orphans, freed slaves, 
his wives and handmaidens, a small number of Mercenaries and an assortment of
children.

 DRAVINOR IS CONSIDERED TO BE ONE OF THE FASTEST RISING YOUNG STARS ON  
THE ASSASSINATION SCENE. HE IS CUNNING AND QUICK WITH A GOOD SENSE OF TIMING SO 
CRITICAL TO THE EXECUTION OF HIS PLANS. HE IS NOT STUPID AND WILL NOT ATTEMPT TO
FACE ANYONE IN A STRAIGHT FIGHT IF HE CAN HELP IT. HE IS MOST AT HOME IN THE	
SANDS AND WILL BE HANDICAPPED IF FORCED TO WORK OUTSIDE OF THE DESERT REGIONS.  
		 MOST OF THE ASSASSINATIONS HE HAS DONE HAVE BEEN POLITICALY BASED AND  
HE PREFERS TO WORK IN THAT CIRCLE. HIS AVERAGE PAY IS 500 G.P. PLUS THE COST OF 
POISONS.

		 HE IS CONSTRAINED FROM ENTERING THE REGION BY AMOS KAB AND DOVA KABA	
BOTH OF WHOM HAVE A VESTED INTEREST IN KEEPING THEIR AREA FREE OF THE GREATER	
WOLVES. AS DO THE WOLVES THEMSELVES WHO WILL DO NOTHING TO HELP AND MUCH TO		
HINDER.																			
		ABU KAB IS DEATHLY AFRAID OF BEL'KANI'KATA THE DEMON OF THOUGHT WHO ALSO 
INHABITS THIS PLANE.															
		ANY PRIME MATERIAL ENTITY ON THIS PLANE WILL BE MUCH HARDER TO SCRY THAN 
NATIVES OF THE PLANE. IT IS FOR THIS REASON THAT ABU KAB WILL PROBABLY SUMMON A 
HEROE FROM THE PRIME MATERIAL PLANE AND TELL HIM THAT HIS TRUE NAME IS KNOWN TO 
ABU KAB AND HIS LIFE IS FORFEIT IF HE DARES REBEL.
