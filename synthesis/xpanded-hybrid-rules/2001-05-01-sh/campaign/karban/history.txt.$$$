Just a few notes (neutral, unbiased) on our run of July 5th:  

<jimjm>just a few additions (neutral, unbiased) on the notes.<jimjm>

As you may recall, we left the last system with 30 miners on board, 
including Rissa Dortinsdottir.  We had bought out their contracts and 
took them with us.   

As we entered the current system, we saw a transition point activate - 
presumably a ship or two had just left the system as we arrived.  
We approached a star system.  Orbiting the star was a Jovian gas 
giant, with a ring similar to Terra's Saturn (only thicker).  
However, instead of consisting mainly of fine particles and frozen 
crystals, this planet's ring was almost an asteroid belt.  
Also orbiting the gas giant, generally within the asteroid ring, was a 
moon, or planetoid.  Orbiting the planetoid was a 4-meter metallic 
sphere.  

<jimjm>
just a little more detail:
The third planet out was the super Jovian gas giant.   The asteroid ring
had a thicker cross-section that is typical for such a ring.   Also, that ring
was canted at a fifteen degree angle.

The planetoid was roughly four fifths the size of Sol III's moon.

Our hero, the Alphan Ambassador, conducted a short-term mystokinetic 
probe into the area's near future.  What he saw was a vision of a ship 
in proximity to the planetoid and sphere.  He had pre-cognition of 
danger' which was associated with seeing an object 'bounce' off the 
sphere/planetoid system.  

<jimjm>
Timing and sequence are a little off.
It was at this time that Dr. Barry told Karban that they needed to move
anyone who was there out of conference room A. Mr. Brazil and 
Karban had a short discussion about Dr. Barry's apparent  condition.
Mr. Brazil insisted that Dr. Barry give him her light saber for the time being 
before Karban would let them out of the laboratory.

The Ambassador strolled up onto the bridge to assess the general 
demeanor of the crew and to ascertain whether any ships had been 
sighted.  The crew was calm, but focused; and no other ships were 
evident.  

<JimJM == revised version ==>
As the ship approached the planetoid and its sphere, several things 
happened:

Mr. Ishido indicated that he was doing an orbital analysis of the asteroid belt 
in the immediate area of the planetoid in order to determine when an asteroid 
would next hit the planetoid. Karban indicated that if no asteroid was going to hit
in the next ten minutes she would order a missile launch with a deactivated warhead
at the planetoid. In effect, poking it.

An asteroid on an impact course with the planetoid was identified.
The crew on the bridge observed the asteroid being 
deflected from the sphere/planetoid system, just as the Ambassador had 
foreseen.

Several of the ship's internal systems were fried by what appeared to be
point source emanations in the ship. It was at this point that conference room A was engulfed
in an electrical system derived fireball.

Karban and the captain  issued orders for the ship to reverse itself
and get a distance away from the planet.

During the reversal another asteroid was deflected from the planetoid.
Other systems about the ship were rendered inoperative, including the engine
of one of the drop shuttles, a security camera in the cargo bay, and a door 
lock on one of the unsecured levels. 

The Field Commander called yet another of her incessant PRAC meetings in 
Conference Room B. The resourceful Ambassador was able to patch in to his 
extensive library of Alphan historical and theoretical documents; - 
regretably, his background search came up blank.  The meeting droned on 
nonetheless. 

The wise Ambassador removed himself to his quarters, where he could 
productively consult with the spirits of his ancesters regarding their 
ancient knowledge of objects like the sphere.  Indeed, his family was 
acquainted with the form and style of construction, and identified it as an 
artifact created by - what the crew would say - the 'Ykraine'.  
Immensely satisfied with the fruits of his inquiry, the Ambassador 
dutifully alerted the crew of the vessel that he had discovered information 
vital to interacting with the sphere.  The Field Commander inexplicably 
tossed aside this intelligence, and delayed the Ambassador's 'report' for 
an hour - for another meeting(!).  To add insult to insanity, the Field 
Commander generally notified the crew that this meeting was optional(!).  
Well, - convinced that there was only one individual actually bringing 
any critical thinking to bear on the situation, the Ambassador moved 
into action.  With the aid of powerful meditation focus devices, he 
was able to perform an especially spectacular 'surface read' of the 
sphere.  In that extraordinary effort, he discovered that the sphere 
contained a sentient being!  

Deftly, the Ambassador switched his intention from passive assessment 
to active communication.  He successfully hailed the being in the 
sphere and opened up a dialogue - hereafter referred to as the 
Sentinel'.

Although telepathic link with an alien mind at astronomical distances 
is frighteningly difficult, the Ambassador was able to engage in an 
extensive conversation with the Sentinal.  

In that conversation, the Alphan was able to convey the sense to the 
Sentinal that he had come in peace, to explore and investigate.  Among 
other things, the Sentinal asked what his relationship to the Yssdak 
was - the Ambassador replied "hostile/adversary".  
The Ambassador requested permission to approach the Sentinal.  The 
Sentinal replied with the reponse "Logic For?" - which the Ambassador 
mis-understood as "Logic 4" - a common error message in Alphan 
programming.  Nevertheless, at this point, the Sentinal initiated 
contact with the ship itself and the crew.  It began a ship-wide probe 
of the hull, then the internals of the ship (inadvertantly overloading 
some of the input portals for the computer system). A wide variety
of the systems were cycled through their paces.

Dr. Barry, moving towards the bridge, noticed
that her light saber had a number of lights flickering on it. She stopped,
Cast her life saber away from her and had Karban isolate the hallway.
She and Nathan Brazil watched the light saber from the other side
of a bulkhead door. Mr. Ishido checked a visual of Dr. Barry's office
and confirmed that one of the other Ykraine artifacts was also 
flashing lights.

The Sentinal first initiated communication as coded sequences of light 
on the bridge, but later moved to more primitive audio interfacing in 
Spanglish - to accomodate the mental limitations of the crew.  The 
crew muddled through contact with the Sentinal, discovering by 
accident that the Sentinal considered both Terrans and Yssdak to be 
descendants of the 'Ykraine'.  

The sentinel displayed a series of images of import.  Including multiple
 images of the Ykraine, a race somewhat larger than but akin to the 
Yssdaak, and a race similar to cro-magnon man. In addition it displayed
the location of six other star systems that  may contain other Ykraine colonies.
The sentinel declined to identify the Friendlies but did query the bridge 
with a picture of a shadowy creature that flowed between a black 
semi-amorphous and a semi crystalline lobster/alien mix.   It also 
identified an area of the galaxy which might belong to these creatures.

In almost comic absurdity, the crew spent most of their contact-time 
with the eons-old Sentinal asking for directions.  The Sentinal did 
show them the local star map, identifying the sixteen transition 
points in the system, and where those points mapped to.  

Meanwhile, the Ambassador was delving deeply into the higher thought 
processes of the entity.  In response to the Sentinal's query 
Warrior/Priest?", the Ambassador replied "Priest?" - to which the 
Sentinal responded "Not Yet".  (This conversation was echoed on the 
bridge in Spanglish for the crew, who encountered "Status Event 
Change" associated with the presence of "Warrior/Priest".)  

The Ambassador requested of the Sentinal:  "Altar/Treasure/Protected 
Things?" and after that: "Where?"  - and in response was shown a 
vision of himself bathed in light.  In its last communication before 
signing off, the Sentinal said "Gift".  As a token of its appreciation 
for its contact with the Alphan, religous artifacts of mystical 
knowledge were then transported from the Sentinal to the Ambassador.  

This same conversation, with warrior as the focus, took place between
Dr. Barry and the sentinel. She does report this later when reports are
handed in.

The gift sent to the Ambassador floated through space into one of the 
cargo bays of the ship.  The Ambassador immediately attempted to 
secure it, but, exhausted from the effort of the telepathic link with 
the Sentinal, was unable to teleport the gift into his room.  The 
Ambassador then spent neeeded time in a healing/rejuvinating trance to 
recover completely - about four hours.

Upon returning to normal consciousness, the Ambassador responded to 
the Field Commander's request for a tete-a-tete.  However, rather than 
respect the dignity of the office which the Ambassador held, the Field 
Commander attempted to berate him for not attending the 'optional' 
PRAC meeting.  In spite of the disrespect shown, the Ambassador 
courteously related the information culled from his ancestral research 
which the Field Commander and crew had so easily dismissed before.    
Returning to his quarters, the Ambassador was again unable to recover 
the gift.  At around midnight, his third attempt to transport the gift 
to his quarters finally succeeded.  The gift turned out to consist 
mostly of sequential religous icons.  The Ambassador - though tired 
from the day's work - was intrigued by what he had been given.  
Not ten minutes later, his weary contemplation was rudely interrupted 
by the crew.  Even after receiving the "Privacy" response from both 
the Ambassador's door and comm system, the crew insisted upon 
intruding - by contacting his bodyguard directly.  The crew and even 
the other ambassadors seemed to be frantic - clamoring at his door 
about some missing books.  
Worn out from the events of the day, and unwilling to start a 'wild 
goose chase' at that hour for something the crew had evidently 
misplaced, the Ambassador calmly granted an audience for the next 
morning to discuss whatever they were so excited about.  
Thus ending the run.
