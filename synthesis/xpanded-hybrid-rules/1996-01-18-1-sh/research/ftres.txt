AB: Full-text searching is likely to become an even more important activity
in the future as the amount of information in computer-readable form
increases and the demand for information grows. The CD-ROM provides a
cost-effective medium for storing large quantities of information.
Unfortunately, its physical characteristics limit its retrieval
effectiveness. As a result, new storage structures, especially those
uniquely suited to the CD-ROM, need to be considered for improving
retrieval times. This paper introduces the multi-character trie as an index
structure for full-text retrieval on CD-ROMs. The structure offers several
advantages when compared to other structures currently in use. Experimental
results provide several comparisons with the widely used  B sup P tree.
Comparisons are also made with other structures used for full-text
retrieval.

AB: The current method of information retrieval used for bibliographic and
full-text databases of journal articles assumes a semantic representation
together with stemming, Boolean connectives, etc. This  requires searchers
to have a well-defined idea of what it is that they are searching for. This
is unhelpful for many categories of searcher, in particular expert browsers
and non-expert searchers. An alternative method is developed in this paper,
based on the idea that  articles advance an argument and that this
argumentation can be represented in a manner which enables flexible and
robust searching to be carried out.

articles is gradually becoming reality, according to Racine, who summarizes
Tenopir's factors leading to adoption of full text and  Basch's conditions
that must exist before full text can be provided successfully. Focusing on
issues, Racine addresses the format (ASCII vs. bit-mapped), the mailability
of journals in full text, time coverage of full-text titles, promoting the
service, providing appropriate hardware and software for access,
encouraging end-user accessibility, and costs.

AB: While the retrieval of the full-text of a document might seem to end
all the hassle of using traditional retrieval systems, the results of  the
MEDLINE/Full-Text Project indicate that retrieval from the current
full-text databases of biomedical journal literature does not  match the
dream. During the first phase of the project the researchers learned that
searching the full-text databases resulted in the retrieval of a
significantly larger number of relevant documents than MEDLINE. However,
the full-text databases also resulted in a large number of non-relevant
documents. Currently the researchers are focusing on how to search these
databases to continue  retrieving the large number of relevant documents
but without so many non-relevant items.

AB: General computer experience and knowledge of a specific system being
used at any one time are often assumed to be important predictors of
successful information retrieval sessions. Individual differences such as
cognitive and learning styles may also play some role. Both sets of
variables have been studied in recent information retrieval research.
However, thus far, subject knowledge in the area being searched has
generally been overlooked as a key factor. This study examines the
experiences of novice end users with a multi-file, full-text information
retrieval system. A regression model is developed of the relative
contributions of computer, system, and subject area knowledge to search
success. Success is operationalized as user judgments of the relevance of
retrieved documents. Results indicate that all three variables play a role
in search success as defined.

field of the humanities are clearly more diverse and subtle than the
behavior of information seekers might lead one to expect. These results
emphasize the importance of multi-file searching and the need  to use both
natural language and controlled vocabulary terms. Further investigation of
search vocabulary is particularly important with current developments in
full-text searching and end-user access to databases. The authors discuss
what their research findings imply for the future of online information
retrieval in an environment where (relatively) untrained users will be

AB: Full-text documents are usually searched by means of a Boolean
retrieval algorithm that requires the user to specify the logical
relationships between the terms of a query. This paper summarizes the 
results to date of a continuing program of research at the University of
Sheffield to investigate the use of nearest-neighbor retrieval
algorithms for full-text searching. Given a natural-language query
statement, such methods result in a ranking of  the paragraphs
comprising a full-text document in order of decreasing similarity with
the query, where the similarity for each paragraph is determined by the
number of keyword stems that it has in  common with the query. A
full-text document test collection has been  created to allow systematic
tests of retrieval effectiveness to be carried out. Experiments with
this collection demonstrate that nearest-neighbour searching provides a
means for paragraph-based access to full-text documents that is of
comparable effectiveness to both Boolean and hypertext searching and
that index term weighting schemes which have been developed for the
searching of bibliographical databases can also be used to improve the
effectiveness of retrieval from full-text databases. A current project
is investigating the extent to which a paragraph-based full-text
retrieval system can be used to augment the explication facilities of an
expert system on welding.

AB: An exploratory study was conducted of elementary school children
searching a full-text electronic encyclopedia on CD-ROM. Twenty-eight 
third and fourth graders and 24 sixth graders conducted two assigned 
searches, one open-ended, the other one closed, after two demonstration
sessions. Keystrokes captured by the computer and observer notes were
used to examine user information-seeking strategies from a mental model
perspective. Older searchers were more  successful in finding required
information, and took less time than younger searchers. No differences
in total number of moves were found. Analysis of search patterns showed
that novices used a heuristic, highly interactive search strategy.
Searchers used sentence and phrase queries, indicating unique mental
models for this  search system. Most searchers accepted system defaults
and used the AND connective in formulating queries. Transition matrix
analyses showed that younger searchers generally favored query refining
moves and older searchers favored examining title and text moves.
Suggestions for system designers were made and future research questions
were identified.

AB: This project was designed to test the relative efficacy of index
terms and full-text for the retrieval of documents in those MEDLINE
journals for which full-text searching was also available. The full-text
files used were MEDIS from Mead Data Central and CCML from BRS
Information Technologies. One hundred clinical medical topics were
searched in these two files as well as the MEDLINE file to accumulate
the necessary data. It was found that full-text identified 
significantly more relevant articles than did the indexed file, MEDLINE.
The full-text searches, however, lacked the precision of searches done
in the indexed file. Most relevant items missed in the full-text files,
but identified in MEDLINE, were missed because the searcher failed to
account for some aspect of natural language, used a logical or
positional operator that was too restrictive, or included a concept
which was implied, but not expressed in the natural language. Very few
of the unique relevant full-text citations  would have been retrieved by
title or abstract alone. Finally, as of  July, 1990 the more current
issue of a journal was just as likely to  appear in MEDLINE as in one of
the full-text files.

AB: A study of how high school students use an encyclopedia in both
print  and electronic form is discussed. Over three sessions and
prompted by a set of protocols administered by a participant observer,
16 subjects each conducted three searches, one a verbal simulation, and
one each with the print and electronic versions of a general purpose
encyclopedia. Observer notes, audio tapes of all sessions, captured
keystrokes of the electronic searches, and responses to a final
interview were used to compare print and electronic versions, analyse 
subjects' development of mental models for the electronic system, and
evaluate the human-computer interface effects. Encyclopedias seemed to
be default sources of information for these subjects. Subjects
demonstrated satisfactory use of them by sequentially reading articles
rather than scanning and without using the index. Some subjects simply
applied print models to their electronic searches, not taking advantage
of full-text searching or hypertext capabilities. Most were able to use
some of the electronic system's features and a few took good advantage
of these features and thus appeared to develop distinct mental models
for the electronic encyclopedia by adapting their existing mental
models. Subjects took almost twice as much time, posed more queries, and
examined more articles in the electronic searches. Designers and
instructors are encouraged to guide adaptive transitions by focusing
attention on the  interactive features of electronic systems and the
unique features for browsing, querying and filtering information.
Recommendations about display effects, navigational aids, and query
formulation aids are also made.

AB: This is a description of the IRx system supporting the retrieval of
full-text information within the ORW (Online Reference Works in

Boolean strategies. Retrieval of a reference work using a linear
structure has been successful. Work is now progressing on a revised
system, IRx.2, for retrieval from hierarchically structured texts with
many different elements such as tables, footnotes, figures, etc.  These
special objects are tagged. The use of structure and object-oriented
approaches to retrieval requires an encoding of the source text to
identify both objects and structures. Many publishers now use a Standard
Generalized Markup Language (SGML) for documents. This development
enables text to be published online as easily as in hard copy.

AB: Problems encountered under the syntactic analysis of free text
documents are discussed. As these problems are of general interest in 
nonautomatic or automatic syntactic indexing or search systems, these
problems are presented. The system called COPSY (context op erator sy
ntax), which uses natural language processing techniques during fully
automatic syntactic analysis (indexing and search) of free text
documents is described. Applications under real world conditions are
mentioned as well as evaluation and technical aspects.  Further
developments in the field of thesaurus building and full-text analysis
using the linguistic algorithms of the syntactic retrieval system are
outlined. COPSY was developed as part of a text processing project at
Siemens, called TINA (Text-In halts-A nalyse: text content analysis).
Software from TINA is actually being tested by the U.S. Department of
Commerce for patent search and indexing.

measures of overall success in searching a fact base. The five measures
were success/failure, precision, search term overlap, number  of search
cycles, and time per search. A prelimiary evaluation of the validity of
each measure was also undertaken by examination of respective
psychometric properties and the relationship between an individual
student's score for each measure and that student's score for the
composite of all five measures. The measures are shown to hold promise
for evaluating searches of fact bases.

AB: The rapid proliferation of full-text databases poses serious
problems  to the natural language processing components of information
retrieval systems. Not taking text-level phenomena of written natural 
language discourse into account causes a marked decrease of performance
for many text information system applications. Consequently, appropriate
text parsing facilities must be capable of recognizing the rich internal
structure of full-texts on lower levels  of text connectivity as well as
on the global organizational level of text coherence. This paper
introduces such a parser which is based  on the conceptual knowledge of
its domain and is organized as a collection of distributed lexicalized
grammar modules (word experts) which communicate through
message-passing. Emphasis is placed on text  grammatical specifications
which state formal conditions for recognizing higher-order text
constituents and their coherent configuration on the global level of
textual macro organization.

AB: This paper discusses an exploratory study of elementary school
children searching a full-text electronic encyclopedia on CD-ROM.
Twenty-eight third and fourth graders and 24 sixth graders conducted two
assigned searches, one open-ended, the other one closed, after two
demonstration sessions. Keystrokes captured by the computer and observer
notes were used to examine user information-seeking strategies from a
mental model perspective. Older searchers were more  successful in
finding required information, and took less time than younger searchers.
No differences in total number of moves were found. Analysis of search
patterns showed that novices used a heuristic, highly interactive search
strategy. Searchers used sentence and phrase queries, indicating unique
mental models for this  search system. Most searchers accepted system
defaults and used the AND connective in formulating queries. Transition
matrix analyses showed that younger searchers generally favored query
refining moves and older searchers favored examining title and text
moves. Suggestions for system designers were made and future research
questions were identified.

methods include document clustering methods,  as well as comparisons of
local document excerpts in specified global contexts, leading to
structured text representations in which similar texts, or text

document retrieval. MetaIndex uses a simple transition network parser 
to recognize a language that is derived from the set of main concepts in
the Unified Medical Language System Metathesaurus (Meta-1). MetaIndex
uses a hierarchy of medical concepts, also derived from Meta-1, to
represent the content of documents. The goal of this approach is to
improve document retrieval performance by better representation of
documents. An evaluation method is described, and the performance of
MetaIndex on the task of indexing the Slice of Life medical image
collection is reported.

The method used in this study was based on partial match retrieval techniques using various elements of new records (i.e., those to be classified) as "queries," and a test database of classification clusters generated from previously classified MARC records. Sixty individual methods for automatic classification were tested on a set of 283 new records, using all combinations of four different partial match methods, five query types, and three representations of search terms. The results indicate that if the best method for a particular case can be determined, then up to 86% of the new records may be correctly classified. The single method with the best accuracy was able to select the correct classification for about 46% of the new records.

AB: In recent years researchers have become increasingly convinced that the performance of information retrieval systems can be greatly enhanced by the use of key phrases for automatic conceptual document indexing and retrieval. In this article the authors describe two programs, INDEX and INDEXD, which locate repeated phrases in a document, gather statistical information about them, and rank them according to their value as index phrases. The programs show promise as the basis for a sophisticated conceptual indexing system. The simpler program, INDEX, ranks phrases in such a way that frequently occurring phrases which contain several frequently occurring words are given a high ranking. INDEXD is an extension of INDEX which incorporates a dictionary for stemming, weighting of words and validation of syntax of output phrases. Sample output of both programs is included, and we discuss plans to combine INDEXD with linguistic and artificial intelligence techniques to provide a general conceptual phrase-indexing system that can incorporate expert  knowledge about a given application area.

AB: It is well recognized that automatic indexing is one of the important  functions of a modern Document Retrieval System. Numerous techniques  for this function have been proposed in the literature ranging from purely statistical to linguistically complex mechanisms. Most of these techniques result from examining properties of terms. In this article term distribution is examined within the framework of the Poisson Models. Specifically the effectiveness of the Two-Poisson and  the Three-Poisson Models are examined. The more general Three-Poisson model is examined to see if generalization results in increased effectiveness. The results show that the Two-Poisson model is only moderately effective in identifying index terms. In addition,  generalization to the Three-Poisson does not give any additional power. The only model within the framework of Poisson models which consistently works well is the basic One-Poisson model. The article concludes with a discussion on term distribution information.

AB: The benefits of a well constructed thesaurus to an information retrieval system have long been recognized by both researchers and practitioners in the field. Previous experiments have investigated the construction of thesauri by manual, semiautomatic, and automatic means. Automatic thesaurus generation in particular has proven to be an especially difficult problem. This paper examines both early and current approaches to automatic thesaurus construction and describes an approach to the automatic generation of global thesauri based on the term discrimination value model of Salton, Yang, and Yu and on an  appropriate clustering algorithm. This method has been implemented and applied to two document collections. Preliminary results indicate  that this method, which produces improvements in retrieval performance in excess of 10 and 15 percent in the test collections, is viable and worthy of continued investigation.

AB: Automatic publishing systems are now widely used to produce books and  documents of many types, and the text of these materials, available in machine-readable form, can be used for automatic processing. This study describes automatic methods to generate back-of-the-book indexes based on a syntactic analysis of the text and a phrase-generation system that identifies meaningful index entries.

AB: The author discusses the design of document retrieval systems (DRS), which aid in the retrieval of citations to documents which have potential reference to the user. The author examines the representation of documents or document indexing as a function within  the framework of the Two-Poisson model of automatic indexing. The model is examined with two objectives: 1) to improve the model; 2) to  compare this model to other statistical models for automatic indexing. The distribution of an index's term's within document frequencies is the underlying concept which is addressed.

AB: Connecting and evaluating thesauri is an important task for the systematic development of better information retrieval systems. Connecting thesauri includes not only determining when terms in different thesauri are the same but also determining what kinds of relationships can be transferred from one thesaurus to another. This paper first presents issues in connecting and evaluating thesauri. Various experiments in connecting a particular thesaurus, the Medical  Subject Headings, with other medical thesauri are described. In these experiments, similar terms in two thesauri are recognized and then differences in two thesauri are exploited to create more powerful thesauri. Part of the evaluation requires the thesaurus to support automatic indexing and retrieving of documents.

DT: Report
AB: Research is being conducted in the Indexing Aid Project, Automated Classification and Retrieval Program, Lister Hill National Center for  Biomedical Communications, on the development of interactive knowledge-based systems for computer-assisted indexing of the periodical medical literature. The principal areas of research are knowledge representation and indexing for document retrieval. The report describes the project and the prototype indexing Aid System. The system uses an experimental framebased knowledge representation language, FrameKit, implemented in Franz Lisp, and is designed to interact with trained MEDLINE indexers who will be prompted to enter subject terms as slot values in filling in document-specific frame data structures that are derived from the knowledge base frames. In addition, the automatic application of rules associated with the knowledge base frames produces a set of MeSH keyword indices to the document. The Indexing Aid System exhibits important features which are characteristic of frame systems; representation of explicit relationships through slots which express the relations; slot values,  restrictions on slot values, and rules attached to slots (procedural  attachments) made available by inheritance through inherits-from hierarchies; and slot values made available by retrieval from other slots (internal retrieval). The report is in three parts: Overview of  the Indexing Aid Project and System. Indexing Aid System Design Document, and Indexing Aid System User Manual.

AB: A computer-based technique for automatic selection of features for the classification of non-Gaussian data is presented. The selection technique exploits interactive cluster finding and a modified branch and bound optimization of piecewise linear classifiers. The technique  first finds an efficient set of pairs of oppositely classified clusters to represent the data. Then a zero-one implicit enumeration implements a branch and bound search for a good subset of features. A  test of the feature selection technique on multidimensional synthetic and real data yielded close-to-optimum, and in many cases optimum, subsets of features. The real data consisted of a) 1284 12-dimensional feature vectors representing normal and abnormal breast tissue, extracted from X-ray mammograms, and b) 1060 30-dimensional feature vectors representing tanks and clutter in infrared video images.
