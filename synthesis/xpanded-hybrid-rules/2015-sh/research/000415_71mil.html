&nbsp;417-354 Million Years Ago<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;
(www.paleoportal.org/time_space/period.php?period_id=13)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Caledonian mountains formed
in the early half of this period.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(DD-EVTT, p.21)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The heyday of the brachiopods was
the Devonian period when they occupied the sea floor in amazing numbers.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(DD-EVTT, p.250)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In Devonian time the early simple
growths of plants were joined by the first fern-like plants.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(DD-EVTT, p.246)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;By the early Devonian the
Appalacian ocean had been completely squeezed out of existence in the
north.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(DD-EVTT, p.226)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Floating or swimming creatures,
such as graptolites, were plentiful in the Cambrian, Ordovician and
Silurian seas, but together with other shallow-water planktonic forms
of life they became extinct in the Devonian.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(DD-EVTT, p.251)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In the Devonian there was a
veritable explosion of the scaled and finny. Perhaps the rivers and
lakes of the new Devonian continents became accessible at a time when
the fish had reached a point in evolution where they could adopt to
non-salty waters.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(DD-EVTT, p.254)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Earth movements throughout early
Paleozoic times occurred frequently in Europe and North America and
reached a climax in the Devonian. Known as the Caledonian orogeny, this
climax was accompanied by the intrusion of granites and widespread
alteration of the old geosynclinal sediments. Resting upon the eroded
stumps of the Caledonian rocks are the Old Red Sandstone formations.
Boulder and pebble beds, sands and clays derived from the underlying
formations, these beds contain the remains of strange and armored
fresh-water fish.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(DD-EVTT, p.197)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The land area that arose in the
North Atlantic region has been called the North Atlantis or the Old Red
Sandstone continent. It spanned what is now the North Atlantic but
perhaps the lines along which it would break in the Mesozoic were
already established.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(DD-EVTT, p.237)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;A continuation of the Caledonian
orogeny along the maritime coast of Canada is called the Acadian earth
movement.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(DD-EVTT, p.236)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Nearly all the continent of N.
America was covered by transgressive seas in the Ordovician and the
Devonian, and again in the Cretaceous.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(DD-EVTT, p.171)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In eastern Australia a large
mobile best lasted until the Permian period. This, the Tasmanian
geosyncline, experienced many disturbances and volcanic episodes
alternating with quiet periods.<br>

<br>
415-360 Million&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In Devonian strata from Greenland in
1948 there was found the fossil, Ichthyostega, the earliest and most
primitive of known fossil amphibian.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(E&amp;IH, 1973, p.125)<br>
<br>
412-354 Million&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Devonian. Placoderms, fishes with
armored heads and trunks were abundant during the Devonian but died out
towards the end. They moved their tails from side to side and included
Dunkleosteus.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(NH, 6/96, p.24)<br>
<br>
400 Million&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Scientists in 2004 reported that an
insect fossil named Rhyniognatha, found in Scotland in the 1920s, dated
to this time and speculated that it had wings and could fly.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(SFC, 2/12/04, p.A2)<br>
400 Million&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Fossil remains of coelacanth fish have
been identified in deposits dating back nearly 400 million years. The
fish has a rostral organ in its skull, a feature similar to one that
sharks use to detect the weak electric fields given off by their prey.
Living specimens in 1938 were caught off the coast of East Africa and
in 1998 were caught in Indonesian waters. The females were found to
bear live young following internal fertilization.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(NG, 6/1988, p.833-834)(SFC, 9/24/98, p.A2)<br>
400 Million &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The evolutionary path of sharks and
humans parted about this time.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(NH, 9/96, p.40) <br>
400 Million&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Subduction of the Pacific plate under the
American continent formed the Kalmiopsis wilderness in southeastern
Oregon.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(SFEC, 6/20/99, p.T8)<br>
400 Million BP&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Astronomers in 2002 identified a
binary black hole from this time that resulted from the collision of 2
galaxies and blended to form NGC6240.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(SFC, 11/25/02, p.A6)<br>
<br>
400-300 Million&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Pan-African orogenies. This period of
transformation almost doubled the stable crust in Africa. The
previously separate cratons and the newly heated and compressed
mountain root regions between them were fused into a single shield.
Apart from small areas in the north-west, south-east and the Cape
region, the continent had achieved the outline we know today.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(DD-EVTT, p.148)<br>
<br>
390 Million&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The oldest known insect fossils (390
million yrs) was reported in Science on Nov 11, 1988.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(MC, 11/11/01)<br>
<br>
380 Million&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Reconstruction from fossils of North
American Devonian reef formations of life on a coral reef shows:
sponges, corals, lampshells, snails, trilobites, sea lilies,
octopus-like cephalopods, together with fronds of seaweed and moss
animals.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(DD-EVTT,illustr.#17)<br>
380 Million&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Creatures with four limbs began to appear.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(NYT, 6/7/96, p.B1)<br>
<br>
Middle Devonian&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Slowly did the sea make its way back
into the continental interior of North America. After this slow start
the flooding began to quicken so that in middle Devonian time it
reached across the interior around the Canadian Shield. Only the
Transcontinental Arch, the Ozark Dome and other minor regions were not
covered. To the west the shallow waters spread over an area that began
to warp gently into one of the most remarkable of shelf basins, the
Williston Basin. The deposits of the Williston Sea gave rise to oil and
gas in huge quantities that were preserved in the porous reef rocks and
limestones close at hand.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(DD-EVTT, p.175-176)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Real forests
of lush plants with well-developed leaves and fronds had taken root by
the Middle Devonian, and at the end of the period were reaching 7
meters or more in height, towering over a thick underbrush of ferns,
mosses, liverworts and other smaller plants.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(DD-EVTT, p.246)<br>
<br>
375 Million&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Coralville Lake in Iowa, USA, overflows a
spillway in 1993AD and bares fossils beneath the soil downstream of
creatures of the Devonian period. The fossils indicate that the area
was under water during this period.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(NG, Geographica, Jan, 94)<br>
<br>
370 Million&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Devonian corals are now known to have
secreted skeletons of calcium carbonate, calcite, in a very regular
way., adding tiny rings of it to the top of their skeletal cup as they
grew. The daily increments of regular measure repeat in units of 400
rather than 365. At that time the day would have bee 21.9 hours long.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(DD-EVTT, p.110)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;There were protozoans by the
millions. Only when they, too, developed a hard case of calcium
carbonate late in the Devonian period did they bequeath something of a
fossil record. The blankets of sediment from these tiny animals
accumulated with the corals and crinoids to give us the limestone of
today.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(DD-EVTT, p.251)<br>
370 Million&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Similar corals found in both Morocco and
New York indicate that the two areas were neighbors at this time.<br>

from Alabama to Newfoundland in eastern North America, Britain,
mainland Europe, and coastal north-west Africa. This was another
geosyncline-like belt.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(DD-EVTT, p.198)<br>
<br>
365-357 Million&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;A 2nd known mass extinction occurred
near the end of the Devonian.<br>

<br>
360 Million&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Towards the end of the Devonian period
the seas drew back from the Gondwana super-continent.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(DD-EVTT, p241)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;By late Devonian time the fish
were accompanied by other bony fish that not only undoubtedly had
lungs, but also had stumpy or lobed fins, the antecedents of legs.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(DD-EVTT, p.254)<br>
360 Million &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Acanthostega, the oldest known tetrapod.
It used its limbs to paddle along the bottom of shallow bays and
estuaries. It was about 2-feet long and its limbs ended with 8 delicate
fingers.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(NH, 6/96, p.39)<br>
<br>
c355-344 Mil BP&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In 2002 it was reported that a 1971
fossil from Scotland, initially believed to be an extinct fish, was
actually a tetrapod, one of the earliest creatures to have walked on
land. It was identified as a member of the Whatcheeriidae family and
named Pederpes finneyae.<br>

was one of the first reptiles. It resembled its amphibian ancestors but
laid its eggs on land. Its skull and limb girdles were more robust than
that of an amphibian. Its fossils are found in the Joggins formation at
the base of the upper carboniferous in Nova Scotia.<br>

<br>
350-270 Million&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The amphibians, newts, salamanders
and frogs are all that remain today of a group that became highly
successful and varied in the Carboniferous and Permian periods. The
rise of the insects provided a generous food supply. The amniote egg
allowed the animal to develop to a stage resembling a fully grown adult
gave freedom from the watery environment. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(DD-EVTT, p.254-255)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The first amniotes were small,
apparently secretive insect eaters. The remains of the earliest
representatives were found inside fossilized trunks of hollow Nova
Scotia logs.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(NH, 6/96, p.41)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Over vast area of the
Carboniferous sea floor the crinoids, the delicate, stalked,
flower-like group of echinodermata, lived by the millions, raising
their fragile calyces as much as a meter from the bottom.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(DD-EVTT, p.251)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;From an atmosphere rich in carbon
dioxide the growth of the Carboniferous forests may have removed much
of it in exchange for oxygen.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(DD-EVTT, p.247)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In North America forests covered
about 260,000 sq. km. of the mid-continent; in Europe perhaps 100,000
sq. km.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(DD-EVTT, p.238)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Early in Carboniferous time the
North American continent seems to have slid quietly under the waves to
an extent scarcely matched before or since. For a very brief period
there was stagnation... and it became an expanse of dead, still water.
Slowly the waters became populous again... and from the North-west
territories of Canada to Mexico and from the Pacific ocean to east of
the Mississippi there was once again a shallow sea, the Madison Sea.
This was the last of the great Paleozoic floodings of the N. American
continent.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(DD-EVTT, p.178)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;It was a period during which the
plant kingdom reached an unprecedented luxuriance. Periodic salt water
flooded coastal marshes and killed off the plant growth. Accumulation
of carbonaceous material settled over time to produce peat, lignite and
coal in turn. Multiple cycles of climate and or earth movement caused a
varying proportion of marine and non-marine sediment to accumulate,
which can be measured and which suggest where land and sea lay. The
cycles are called cyclothems.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(DD-EVTT, p.178-181)<br>
<br>
350-200 Million&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Glacial conditions during the
Permo-Carboniferous times laid down a series of rock sediment in all
the southern continents, Australia, Antarctica, India, Africa, and
South America. It is called the Dwyka series in Africa and occurs over
much of the country between the southern cape and the equator. In many
places they are 600 meters thick. A continental polar region answers
the demands nicely with glaciers carrying debris off radially from
around the pole.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(DD-EVTT, p.194)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Gondwana glaciations and the
Glossopteris forests stretched into what is now eastern India where,
again, the ice was moving northwards. In South and East Africa the ice
spread northwards as far as Lake Victoria on the present equator. There
may have been as many as five major glacial ages with warmer spells
between. Between the long cold periods, Glossopteris forest occupied
the well-watered lower regions in South America as it did on the
eastern side of Gondwanaland.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(DD-EVTT, p.241)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;As many as eleven successive old
moraine deposits, one upon another, are known in Australia. The
Paleozoic glacial chill may have lasted 20 million years.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(GH-ADH, p.25)<br>
<br>
345-280 Million&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;A hypothesis was proposed by Gans et
al of the Univ. of Michigan that an oxygen pulse occurred during the
late Paleozoic. An increase of atmospheric oxygen concentrations from
15-35% may have lasted for about a 100 million years. Today the
atmosphere contains about 21% oxygen. The idea is supported by the
extraordinary number of new species documented during this period. A
dense atmosphere would promote insect flight and primitive lung
effectiveness.<br>

<br>
300-250 Million&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Evidence of widespread former
glaciers occurs in strata of this age in eastern South America,

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Lower Permian Red Beds in Texas
and Oklahoma have fossils of the fin-backed reptile, Dimetrodon, which
belong to the group called pelycosaurs. They were probably the first
stage in the development of mammals from reptiles. These meat eater had
teeth of different sizes, long at the front and short in back. The
sail-like fin was probably was probably an early stage in the
development of warm-bloodedness.<br>

<br>
270-210 Million&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Karoo Basin in South Africa,
first took shape in the late Carboniferous and lasted about 60 million
years. It is filled with fluvial, lake and swamp deposits including
coals. At the end of this period were great outpourings of basalt in
the region, when lava flows covered much of the basin to a depth of
1,000 meters, the Drakensberg lavas.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(DD-EVTT, p.164,184)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;On top of the glacial formations
comes a coal measure sequence. The Ecca formations are about 1800
meters in total thickness and contain many beds of thick coal. These
were deposited in the Permian.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(DD-EVTT, p.182)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;This basin subsided beneath layer
upon layer of sedimentary deposits. At least 7000 meters of continental
sediments were deposited here between late Carboniferous and
mid-Triassic times.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(DD-EVTT, p.178)<br>
<br>
270-225 Million&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Reptiles arrived during the Permian
period.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(DD-EVTT, p.21)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Only a few species of trilobites
were alive in the Permian period and none are known from later rocks.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(DD-EVTT, p.249)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In Permian times there was a
progressive drying up of the whole continental area (of Gondwanaland).
Wide areas of the old shields in Australia and South America were
flooded by the shallowest of seas, and when from time to time these
were cut off and desiccated, deposits of dolomite, anhydrite and salt
were left behind. The ice persisted later in Australia where it stayed
till late Permian time.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(DD-EVTT, p242)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Appalachian orogeny seems to
have been concentrated into the Permian period in North America. The
fierce volcanic activity widespread in Europe was not extended into the
west. All of Europe and North America became land. In central Europe
and parts of Russia, in the high Arctic areas of Canada and Siberia and
parts of the southern USA there were limited shallow, very salty seas.
Coral and algal reefs and shell banks sprang up in some parts of the
seas, notably in Texas and new Mexico, and in the lagoons deposits of
gypsum and salt were precipitated.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(DD-EVTT, p.240)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Upper Permian Beaufort sandstones
of South Africa have fossils of the mammal-like reptile Lycaenops. Its
body was dog-like with its legs under its body. It had long killing
teeth at the front and shearing teeth at the back. It was a large group
with size ranging from a few cm. to some as large as a cow. The larger

80 Million&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;A Cretaceous era creature known as the
maiasaur roamed what is today the northern United States. Multimedia
simulations by the Royal Ontario Museum have brought the creature back
to life.<br>

80 Million&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Upper Cretaceous Oldman and Edmonton
formation in Alberta, Canada, has fossils of Struthiomimus. It was
typical of the "ostrich dinosaurs," the last of the coelurosaurs. Their
forelegs had three-fingered grasping hands. The body was long,
horizontal, and balanced by a long rigid tail. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(TE-JB, p.58)<br>
80 Million&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Upper Cretaceous Oldman Formation at Red
deer River, Alberta, Canada, has fossils of the crested duck-billed
Lambeosaurus. It had a massive array of grinding teeth, strong hind
legs with three toes tipped with hoofs and stood 7 m. The smaller front
legs had four toes, two of which had hoofs. There were webs between the
fingers and its tail was flattened from side to side. Other crested,
duck-billed dinosaurs include Corythosaurus, Saurolophus, and
Parasaurolophus. Nests of Maiasaura discovered in Montana in 1979 have
a number of young an advanced stage of development that indicate adult
supervision of the young.<br>

80 Million&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Fossil eggs and embryos of titanosaurs and
apatosaurus of this age were later found in the Patagonian badlands of
Argentina.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(SFC, 9/28/01, p.D8)<br>
80 Million&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Upper Cretaceous Bahairia Formation in
Egypt and Niger have fossils of Spinosaurus. It had fins on its back
supported by strong spines projecting up from the vertebrae. It was the
largest of the fin-backed dinosaurs and the spines were about 1.8 m
long. <br>

80 Million&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;An eighty million-year-old egg was found
in Mongolia&#8217;s Gobi desert by paleontologists who claim it is the first
embryo ever found of a meat-eating dinosaur called oviraptor. A report
on the discovery appears today in the journal Science. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(WSJ, 11/4/94, p.1)(SFC, 2/14/02, p.A6)<br>
80 Million&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Bones from a velociraptor in the Gobi
desert indicated that the dinosaur had a wishbone. The wishbone, fused
collarbones, later provided attachment points for muscles that allow
birds to fly. Also found was a placental mammal with epipubic bones,
structures that had been only associated with marsupials and monotremes.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(SFEC, 10/5/97, p.A20)<br>
80 Million&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Ukhaa Tolgod basin of Mongolia had
fossils from the late Cretaceous. The site was first discovered by Roy
Chapman Andrews during his 1923 Gobi Desert expedition. The 25-foot
tall, 85-foot long Nurosaurus qaganesis was of this period.<br>

80-70 Million &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Late Cretaceous to Early Cainozoic.<br>
<br>
80-70 Million&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Laramide orogeny of the late
Cretaceous was largely responsible for the major features in the
structure of the Western Cordillera.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(DD-EVTT, p.291)<br>
80-70 Million&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The north-west states&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp; of Washington, Idaho and Oregon at this stage became the site of
a flood of basalt lavas from many local fissures. By the time it was
over, some 1500 meters of lava flows had accumulated, covering about
512,000 sq. km.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(DD-EVTT, p.291)<br>
80-70 Million&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;It might be said that for South America
the orogenic crunch came in the late Cretaceous. At that time the giant
bathyliths of the Andes were intruded and the whole region was raised.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(DD-EVTT, p.292)<br>
80-70 Million&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Only one family of flowering plants is
known from the earliest late Cretaceous, but by the end of that period
at least 67 families existed.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(DD-EVTT, p.281)<br>
80-70 Million&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;South-west of Delhi and covering much
of the north-western half of the Indian shield are thousands of square
kilometers of flat-lying floods of late Cretaceous and early Cainozoic
basalt, the Deccan traps.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(DD-EVTT, p.146)<br>
80-70 Million&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;During India&#8217;s passage northward its
western margin seems to have crossed a hot spot on the crust. This
resulted in the release of floods of basalt over the western part of
the subcontinent.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(DD-EVTT, p.288)<br>
80-70 Million&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Mesozoic era closed with the
continents apparently emerging from the waters once again.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(DD-EVTT, p.270)<br>
80-70 Million&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To what extent climactic change set off
the train of extinctions at the close of the Mesozoic era is uncertain.
The cycads and about half the species of early flowering plants died
out and the conifers began to extend their realm little by little from
the cooler areas. Floating, single-celled, algal plants became very
abundant and secreted the minute limey platelets, known as coccoliths,
which built up as chalk. Their photosynthetic activity may have tilted
the abundance of the atmosphere in favor of oxygen and depleting it of
carbon dioxide generating a reverse "greenhouse effect."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(DD-EVTT, p.273-274)<br>
80-70 Million&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Among the typically Paleozoic groups to
fade away at the end of the Mesozoic were certain large protozoans or
foraminifera, the trilobites, the strange segmented eurypterids, the
rugose corals, many bryozoa, echinoderms and brachiopods.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(DD-EVTT, p.275)<br>
80-70 Million&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;By the end of the
Mesozoic the ammonites became extinct and only a few species of their
hardy but possibly more primitive relatives, the nautiloids, survived.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(DD-EVTT, p.277)<br>
80-70 Million&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The squid-like belemnites together with
some families of bryozoa, echinoids and floating foraminifera all
disappeared.<br>

76 Million&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Point Loma Formation near Carlsbad,
CA., contained a nodosaurid, a quadrupedal herbivorous dinosaur with an
extensive covering of bony armor.<br>

75 Million&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Birthday Site of northwestern Montana
features 3 types of hadrosaurs: the Prosaurolophus, the Gryposaurus,
and the Hypacrosaurus. The Daspletosaurus (a 30-foot carnivorous
dinosaur) and the human sized Troodon were also here. The site was
shallow lake water and the array of bones indicates some type of
catastrophic event.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(NH, 4/97, p.66)<br>
<br>
75 Million&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In 1994 the fossil of a birdlike dinosaur
was found in Montana. It was about 3 feet long and weighed about 7
pounds. It was named Bambiraptor feinbergi.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(SFC, 3/18/00, p.A10)<br>
<br>
75 Million&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The ornithominids of this time were
long-necked, birdlike dinosaurs that evolved beaks with comb-like
structures to strain nutrients from water.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(SFC, 8/30/01, p.A4)<br>
<br>
c75 Million BP&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The 30-foot dinosaur Majungatholus
atopus lived here. Its fossils were discovered in 1996. It was similar
to creatures whose fossils were found in Argentina and India. The
horned dinosaur was a remote cousin of T. rex and had sharp serrated
teeth. In 2003 scientists determined that 2-ton, 30-foot creatures were
cannibals.<br>

74 Million BP&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In the Manson Impact a meteorite hit
what is now Manson Iowa at an estimated 60,000 mph and formed a crater
24 miles wide with an impact 3 1/2 miles deep.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(SFEC, 7/5/98, p.A10)<br>
<br>
71 Million&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Earth's continents were clustered
together and sea level was much higher. The Atlantic Ocean was small,
the Pacific was enormous and covered half the Earth. The Tethys Sea, a
shallow, salty body of warm water separated the northern and southern
hemispheres. Enriquetta Barrera, using evidence from one-celled
foraminifera, has found indications of a gradual high-latitude cooling
and a rapid and sharp decrease in deep ocean temperatures in
conjunction with a 150 foot drop in sea level. This lasted about a
million years, when sea levels went back up.<br>
