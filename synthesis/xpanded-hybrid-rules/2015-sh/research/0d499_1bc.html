<hr width="100%">496-406BCE&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Sophocles added valuable
elements to the developing tragic drama. His work involved all men in
the tragic elements of life. His work included the drama Philoctetes.
It was about how the Greeks needed the aged Philoctetes and his magic
bow to capture Troy, but had exiled him to a remote island. They send
Neoptolemus, son of Achilles, to secure the bow by deceit and trickery.
In 1990 the play was rewritten by Seamus Heaney, 1995 Nobel poet
laureate, as "The Cure at Troy."<br>

<br>
494BCE&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In Rome the first victory of the plebeian
class over the patricians resulted in an agreement between the two
classes to allow the plebeians to elect officers, and tribunes with the
power to veto any unlawful acts of the magistrates.<br>

<br>
490BCE&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Sep 2, Phidippides of Athens set out on his
26-mile run that inspired the Marathon. Phidippides was sent to seek
troops from Sparta to help against the invading Persian army. The
Spartans were unwilling to help, until the next full moon, due to
religious laws. On Sept. 4th, Phidippides returned the 26 miles
Marathon without Spartan troops.<br>

<br>
490BCE&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Sep 9, First Persian attack on Greece. Greeks
led by Miltiades defeated the Persians at the Battle of Marathon.
Pheidipiddes, a hemerodromi or long-distance foot messenger, was
dispatched to run 26 miles from marathon to Athens to announce the
victory. He reached Athens and proclaimed: "Rejoice! We conquer!" The
he dropped dead. In the Battle of Marathon Darius the Great of Persia
was defeated by the Greeks. The Greeks initiated the war when Persia,
the strongest power in western Asia, established rule over
Greek-speaking cities in Asia Minor. [see Sep 12]<br>

<br>
490-479BCE&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Greco-Persian War is commonly regarded
as one of the most significant wars in all of history. The Greeks
emerged victorious and put an end to the possibility of Persian
despotism.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(eawc, p.10)<br>
<br>
c490-430BCE&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Greek philosopher Zeno of Elea
proposed a number of paradoxes to support the claim of Parmenides that
the world was a motionless, unchanging unity. The race between Achilles
and the tortoise is one example.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(WUD, 1994, p.1660)(SFC, 7/14/97, p.E5)<br>
<br>
486-465BCE&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Xerxes I ruled over Persia from India to
the lands below the Caspian and Black seas, to the east coast of the
Mediterranean including Egypt and Thrace. Its great cities Sardis,
Ninevah, Babylon, and Susa were joined by the Royal Road. East of Susa
was Persopolis, a vast religious monument. To the north of Persia were
the Scythians. [2nd source says 485-465]<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(V.D.-H.K.p.49)(eawc, p.11)<br>
<br>
c485BCE&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Athenian democracy was accompanied by an
intellectual revolution with beginnings in Sophism. Sophists situated
ethics and politics within philosophical discourse, which before was
limited to physics and metaphysics alone. Protagoras, the leading
Sophist, stated: "Man is the measure of all things." For him all truth,
goodness, and beauty are relative to man's necessities and inquiries.
In opposition to the Sophists emerged Socrates, Plato and Aristotle,
each of whom offered alternatives to the Sophist's relativism.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(eawc, p.11)<br>
<br>
484-420BCE&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Herodotus was the first historian to lay
out a coherent story. He authored the 9-book history of the
Graeco-Persian War: "Researches into the Causes and Events of the
Persian Wars," and the "The Histories of Herodotus." He also wrote a
book dedicated to his travels through Egypt.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(V.D.-H.K.p.53)(SFC, 3/26/97, p.A12)(eawc, p.11)<br>
484-420BCE&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Herodotus claimed that the Etruscans were
Lydians who had immigrated to Italy from Asia Minor. But modern
scholars believe the Etruscans evolved from an indigenous population of
Iron Age farmers of the Villanovan culture.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(NG, 6/1988, p.710)<br>
484-420BCE&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Greeks always called the Etruscans the
Tyrrhenians, after the prince Tyrrhenus who, according to Herodotus,
led them to the shores of Etruria.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(NG, 6/1988, p.718)<br>
484-420BCE&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Herodotus mentioned gold-digging ants and
that some were kept at the palace of the Persian king. It was later
learned that the Persian word for marmot is equivalent to mountain ant,
and that marmots in the Dansar plain of northern Pakistan bring up gold
dust from their burrows. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(SFC, 11/25/96, p.A10)<br>
<br>
484-406BCE&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Euripides was an Athenian tragedian who
brought the gods and heroes down to earth. He presented pictures of
human life that were sometimes tragic, sometimes comic, but always and
undeniably real. [see 480-406]<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(V.D.-H.K.p.52)<br>
<br>
487BCE&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Sep 23, Greek dramatist Euripides, was born.
He wrote "Medea" and "The Trojan Women." His plays used a device called
"Deus ex Machina," literally "God from a machine." Today the term
refers to sudden events that come from nowhere to advance the plot.

481-221BCE&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Waring States period of the Chou
Dynasty. [see 475-221] The states of Ch'in and Ch'u emerged as the
primary competitors in the struggle to found an empire. During this
period a 4-tiered class structure emerged consisting of lesser nobility
(including scholars), the peasant farmers, the artisans, and the
merchants, who held the lowest position in society. This was also known
as the period of the Hundred Schools of Thought with the emergence of
several schools of political philosophy that included: Confucianism,
Taoism, Mohism and Legalism.<br>

the Persian navy at Salamis. Phoenician squadrons were at the heart of
Xerxes' fleet; the king of Sidon was among his admirals. 31 states of
the Hellenic League fought Xerxes.<br>

c480BCE&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Vardhamana Mahavira, the semi-legendary
teacher who reformed older doctrines and established Jainism, died. He
is regarded as the 24th and latest Tirthankara, one of the people to
have attained personal immortality through enlightenment. Jainism was
founded as a dualistic, ascetic religion as a revolt against the caste
system and the vague world spirit of Hinduism.<br>

human life. In 1997 Greek archeologists claimed to have discovered the
island cave where he worked. [see 484-406, 487]<br>

322BCE&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Mar 7, Aristotle (d.322 BCE) died. His
writings included treatises on logic, metaphysics, ethics, politics,
rhetoric and natural sciences. He first described language in terms of
subject and predicate as well as parts of speech. Aristotelian logic is
based on a small number of unambiguous constructs, such as, "if A, then
B": the truth of one implies the truth of another. This celebrated rule
gives Aristotelian reasoning the power to establish facts through
inference. The constructs also included A=A, representing that every
entity is equal to itself. He defined politics as the science of the
sciences that looks after well-being. His writings included "De
Generatione Animalum." His "Historia Animalium" was later translated by
D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson." "Hope is a waking dream." The opening of
his "Metaphysics" began: "All men by nature desire to know."<br>

the "Warring States." King Zheng engaged in a process of unifying 7
kingdoms in China under a central bureaucracy. He killed most of the
