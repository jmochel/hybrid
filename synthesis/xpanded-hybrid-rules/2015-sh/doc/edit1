Good day folks,

You receive this because at some point you expressed an interest, wholehearted 
or tentative, in gaming.

I have been promising all of you that I would be sending something like this out 
and now I have gotten my butt in gear. I have actually spent a great deal of the 
past month or so in designing the races and cultures of the world we are going 
to play in. My intention is to create an enjoyable and rich experience.

Let me tell you what is going to happen:

1. We are going to do a doodle poll to determine when we can play our first game

	My intention is to go for one game every two months. I'd like to go from 9 AM 
	or 10 AM in the morning till roughly dinnertime. I'd like to have the first 
	game here at my house after that I figured we would rotate homes depending on 
	how people want to manage it.
	
	Here is the link for the doodle poll: http://www.doodle.com/5bscvvgzchkgpdri
	
			
	Please fill it out as soon as you can and select any of the days that would 
	work for you. We will go with the day that we can get the most people for.

2. People will start playing with character concepts and designing their characters.

	I will be setting up times to meet with people and design and create 
	characters. I just want to point out those were starting out for the first 
	time that this is supposed to be fun and is supposed to involve asking 
	questions and getting answers and figuring out what you'd like to play. 
	
	There is no right way to do this.
		
	As part of this, I have written a short description of each of the major 
	cultures as well as a set of short vignettes or stories, to give you a feel for 
	some of the different cultures. I will be adding to the vignettes over time. 

	The vignettes are located at:
