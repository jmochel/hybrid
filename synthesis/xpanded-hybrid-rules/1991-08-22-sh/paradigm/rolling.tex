\chapter{Rolling the Dice}

\section{Outline}
This chapter discusses the way in which dice are used in Space Hybrid.

\section{The One True Roll}
There is one main type\footnote{Excluding Rolls against a table}
of die roll in Space Hybrid. The roll is made
with percentile dice against a Target Number (TN). Normally the TN is
derived by multiplying the Ease Factor (EF) of the roll times the 
Stat Basis (SB) of the roll. Depending on how well the roll is made, 
special or critical sucesses may be achieved.

\subsection{Examples}
As an example, let us look at a simple roll. The character must make a
ease factor 7 roll against a stat basis of 8. The target number is
thus: \(7*8 = 56\). The character rolls a 4 on percentile dice. The target
number - the roll is 52. The numeric quantity gain is
referred to as Gain Number (GN).

Some typical rolls are displayed below.

\begin{itemize}
	\item An EF = 4 roll, SB = 7, TN = 28
	\item An EF = 10 roll, SB = 8, TN = 80
	\item An EF = 6 roll, SB = 5, TN = 30
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Calculating Succes}
In calculating the effects of a SN one simply takes the expected 
gain of the roll and multiply by the Effect Number on the right hand 
side of the table.

In the case of non-numeric gains it is up to the GM to decide 
what is the overall gain of the roll.
