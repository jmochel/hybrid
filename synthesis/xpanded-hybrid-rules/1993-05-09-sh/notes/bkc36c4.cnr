        This is the idea I favored the last time GMAST discussed a
Public Domain RPG, but I was stymied by the problem of breaking up
all the possible realms of ability into categories and sub-categories.
However, I now have a Brilliant Inspiration: instead of working from the
top down, take each skill and work from the BOTTOM UP... that is, when a
player picks a skill he'd like to have, the GM works BACKWARDS from this to
find how many levels there are above it. For example, the player says "I'd like
to have Defense." So the GM says, "Well, that'd be a subset of Combat, and that
would be a subset of Physical Ability, and that would be a subset of General
Ability." So Defense would be a Level 4 ability.

        Now the only problem is to decide point costs by level... this would be
sort of arbitrary (as would the GM's system of classification), but I'd suggest
either base 2 or base 3. Thus level 1 might be 128 points per skill point,
level 2 would be 64, level 3 would be 32, level 4 would be 16, etc. (for a
total of 8 possible levels).

        I have to get to work now but I'll try to elaborate on this later...
if anyone has any comments, by all means send 'em in.
