 GMAST-L Role-Playing Game Designers' Guidelines (Proposed)      Revised 12/11
===============================================================================


These Guidelines are intended to be the model by which we compare and criticize
others' ideas.  Instead of saying that an idea is stupid or won't work, point
out that it doesn't account for such-and-such in the Guidelines, and we can
discuss from there.



I. Goal

Discuss the problems of creating a role-playing game (RPG) and conceive a
well-designed RPG.



II. Subject

We will create a game that can be used as a generic, or universal,
role-playing system.  However, such a generic RPG is not very playable (and
not very interesting), so we will simultaneously create a Fantasy module to
supplement it.

Choosing a single genre allows us to choose some skills and weapons to deal
with, so that we have concrete examples with which to work.

Fantasy was chosen because most designers are quite familiar with the
concepts of the Fantasy genre, and the problems inherent in creating such a
game.  Also, this genre includes a wide range of intriguing problems to
solve, such as weapon, hand-to-hand, and ranged combat; magic and casting;
deities and monsters; and so on.

However, every effort should be made to make the RPG as general as possible, so
that new modules can be added to the RPG for other genres.  The only reason we
are limiting ourselves to Fantasy is to reduce the amount of work and provide a
narrower focus.



III. Aspects

As discussed, we will strive to satisfy many different aspects or mini-goals
that we find desirable in RPGs in general.  These aspects are detailed below.


A. Clarity

The rules -- and proposed rules! -- should be clearly written and easily
understood.

B. Efficiency

Whenever possible, rules should be in their _simplest form_.  This does not
imply that the rules cannot be complex, just that we need to strip away extra
baggage that is not necessary.  Game mechanics should be easy to use.
Eliminate tables, charts, and formulas whenever possible.  Mark optional rules
as such.

C. Skill-based

The foundation of the game system will be the attribute and skill systems.
There will be no _forced_ "classes" or "archetypes."  All other game systems
will be founded on the concept of skills.

D. Basis

Every term will be reduced, whenever possible and desirable, to its simplest
forms.  That means Dexterity might be reduced to Agility, Manual Dexterity,
Grace and Reflex, if this is desirable.

E. Modularity

The game should be composed of separate sections that can be removed and
replaced easily.  The sections should be independent of each other, but all
based on the same skill/attribute system.  It should be easy to add-in new
systems, such as a new type of magic system, and so on.

F. Scalability

As much as possible, the game should allow the players and GM to scale the
various systems to the levels of detail that they prefer.

G. Unification

The systems created should apply to as many different creatures, beings,
and items as possible.  Thus characters, monsters, and divine beings should
all be describable using the same rules.  Animals, characters, and objects
should all have similar characteristics and attributes, as much as
possible.



IV. Copyrights, etc.

All contributions to this project go into the Public Domain.  The final
project becomes part of the Public Domain.  All contributors should receive
a mention in the credits.  No one may copyright all or part of the GMAST-L
RPG design project.

 Order of Business (Proposed)                                    Revised 12/11
===============================================================================

The following Order of Business should serve as a step-by-step checklist for
our game designing efforts.  We should attempt to limit our posts to the
current subject.  If you have an idea for a later topic, write it up and _save
it_ to send later.  Please stay on-topic, so as to not create chaos, wreak
havoc, or release Bthulhu (the ancient cow demon lord of entropy).


A. Concepts and Guidelines
B. Foundation systems
    1. Attribute names & definitions
    2. Task resolution system
    3. Temporal concerns (game turns, combat rounds)
C. Skill lists & definitions
D. Combat system
    1. Hand-to-hand (HTH)
    2. Ranged
    3. Special cases
E. Advancement or experience system
    1. Normal advancement
    2. Between-session training
F. Magic system
    1. Types of magic, magic theory
    2. Adjudication of casting
    3. Examples, guidelines, spell lists (if necessary)
G. Character Generation
H. Development

 Task Resolution System (Proposed)                               Revised 12/11
===============================================================================

Credits

This is a look at my proposed difficulty system.  I first saw this system in
Adventure Quest/Jaern, a fantasy RPG published by Lafayette Simulations, a
small game company out of Valparaiso, Indiana.  The game was released at GenCon
'91 this last August by the designers, Daniel Lawrence and Robert Blake.

This is what I'd call an inverse difficulty system.

Character stats are numeric (rated 0 to some number).  Task difficulties are
rated in terms of DICE -- an easy task might be rated "1d6" and a hard task
might be rated "5d6".


Task Resolution

To resolve tasks, the dice described by the difficulty rating (e.g., 4d6) are
rolled and compared to the skill or attribute stat.

If the roll is equal to or less than the stat, the roll succeeds.  If the roll
is more than the stat, the roll fails.

Example:

X has a Strength of 12, and wants to lift a heavy rock.  The GM sets the
difficulty of this task at 4 (4d6).  X rolls 4d6 and compares it to his
Strength.

If he rolls between 4 and 12, X succeeds.  If he rolls greater than 12 (13-24),
X fails.  X rolls a 24 (all sixes!) and the GM rules that X herniates himself
in the effort.  =)


Opposing Rolls

In situations where two characters are doing opposing actions -- e.g., arm
wrestling, or combat -- they make opposing rolls.

The character with initiative would choose a number of dice and make a task
roll with those dice.  If he succeeds, his opponent must make a similar task
roll using the same number of dice, and succeed to avoid losing against the
character with initiative.

The player's choice of dice can indicate his character's attitude toward the
task.

Example:

X and Y are arm wrestling.  X has a Strength of 11.  Y has a Strength of 8.
X has initiative.

X chooses to roll 3 dice, rolls 3d6, and gets a 10 (success).  Y rolls 3d6 and
manages to get a 6, which succeeds (6 < 8).  Nothing happens that round.

Y has initiative the 2nd round, and chooses to roll 2 dice, rolls 2d6 and gets
a 7 (success).  X rolls 2d6, and rolls an 11 which barely succeeds.  Nothing
happens.

X chooses to roll 4 dice to get this over with, rolls 4d6, getting a 14 --
failing his Strength roll.  Nothing happens.

Y chooses to roll 3d6 and manages to succeed with another 7.  X rolls 3d6 and
gets a 12 -- tough luck!  X fails that roll and loses the arm wrestling match.
