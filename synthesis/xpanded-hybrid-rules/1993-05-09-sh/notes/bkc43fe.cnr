Subject:      So when will we see some drafting?!?
To: Multiple recipients of list GMAST-L <GMAST-L@UTCVM>

It certainly seems that the list is fired up about game design and the Unified
Field Theory of gaming!
        I'm all for a comprehensive system; modular, scalable, efficient, etc.
are all watchwords for me as well.  Yet another Computer Science student!
        I'd be more than happy to critique, add to, and suggest mods to any
draft rules which drifted my way; unfortunately, I haven't done much in the way
of game design, only campaign design.
        I do, however, have some features I like in existing systems:

                The modularity factor in PARANOIA,

                The option for established classes/archetypes OR
                custom-designed characters from the attributes up of Shadowrun
                (what SR player hasn't spent hours on p. 53, "creating an
                Archetype"?), and

                The impressive scalability of GURPS.

        I'm an advocate of skills making the character, rather than the
character class dictating the skills.  Using sample class models makes for a
good starting point, if just learning the system, but I like the example my GM
sets the way he arbits Star Trek: if you need a skill, roll it up.  He runs
things such that attribute checks and skill checks make up most of the action,
and almost everything in between is roleplaying.  If something needs more
detail, however, he tends to rely on improvisation rather than any set modular
structure.  Rulebooks would probably help...
        ...But I digress.  A more concrete system, just as flexible, just as
simple, but with true modular expandability and consistent combat scales ("just
how effective *is* a ship-mounted phaser on stun setting, John?") is exactly
what the roleplaying world needs.  Just imagine...Galaxy-class starships
battling magical galleons, dodging psifire via boosted reflexes while casting a
fireball with one hand and firing a Luger with the other...SIMPLY!  A dream?
Perhaps.  But at least worth a real try and excellent discussion.

                Ursus
