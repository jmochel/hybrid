As a general note on how finely you wish to split attributes, it makes a big
difference on whether skills are "skill-driven" or "attribute driven".

Take the fine/coarse dexterity example.  If skills are attribute driven,
ala GURPS and Hero, a person with a high Dex who buys *any* Dex skill, will
automatically have a good score in it.  On the other hand, if attributes
contribute much less to the skill (ala TimeLords...shameless plug;), the
attribute only gives you a better default, which is not all that high.  In
the first case, you might need two Dex'es (agility/coordination), while on
the other, the person's ability to "pickpocket" is independent of their
"acrobatics/combat dodge".

As one of the cornerstones of all other mechanics, you'll need to decide how
this is done.
