        Paranoia and TimeLords both include "optional" rules sections for
those who like extra detail. A good idea, I agree. And of course there's the
famous example of Basic and Advanced D&D (and whatever other flavors there
are -- if I'm not mistaken, there was an Expert Set too, and maybe one
or two others).
        However, there are two difficulties:

        1) An "optional" rule may, if the designer isn't careful, cascade and
require changes in fundamental rules as well.

        2) If a designer has the talent to sidestep the simplicity/realism
problem through scalability -- i.e., by allowing the GM to choose the balance
he prefers -- I say great. But few designers do have that talent; most "lean
toward" one design philosophy or another, and as a result they can't
convincingly write a system, or a set of optional rules for a system, that
utilizes a different philosophy (even Paranoia's "advanced" rules, for example,
are still simple and quick).

        A fine idea -- earlier today I posted a long message on TWERPS,
which is about as "grandly unified" as you can get (one attribute, STR, for
everything -- people, animals, cars, barns). By the time I'd finished writing
the message I'd persuaded myself that I like TWERPS better than Paranoia...
wow, I should be a professional orator.
        If you have the time, please post a more detailed description of how
you utilize "unification" in your system(s).

GM: Okay, you attack the barn, but your attack doesn't seem to have as
much effect as it should have.
PLAYER: Hmm... I attack it again.
GM: No luck. It's a very hearty barn. Roll for perception... okay, you
notice a circular plaque on the wall above your head, and sense an aura
of stoic faith emanating from the barn.
PLAYER: Aaugh! An Amish barn! These things are indestructible!
