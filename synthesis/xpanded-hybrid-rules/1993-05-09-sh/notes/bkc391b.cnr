    I think we are talking about different things. The kind of problems I
was talking about are those that would arise from trying to solve every
statistical aspect of the system with only 1 or 2 different scales. An
indivuidual scale might be closed or open-ended, but it would be tought to
resolve weapon damage on the ability score scale. I think that it is
important to have at least a few different rolling meathods for resolving
the numbers of the different scales. Some might be linear scales, and
others might be bell curves. There are times when both are appropriate.

    How about slots like those for skill proficiencies (pardon my AD&D
vocab), and possibly a relativistic power scale that could be controlled by
the caster. Not necessarily spell points, but along the same lines. But I
definately agree that there needs to be something that allows for the
felxibily ot spell-point systems.

    Another concept that has been used is a measure of the characters
current stress level, or how threatening the situation at hand is when the
skill attmept has been made. The worse the case, the higher the reward for
failure.

    I'n not so sure about this one. If I have learned something to a
certain skill level, and then fail in the attempt to utilize that skill, I
would just really screw-up that time. I wouldn't forget what I already
knew. If you want to deal with skill dropping, then set a time limit for
their uise based on some kind of memory/int stat. If the character doesn't
use the skill within this period then there is a chance that it could drop.

    The pantheon isn't necessarily part of the RPG, but if there is a
priest type character that could be created, who would get powers from
god-types then I feel the better thing to do is tie the religion to the
world, and not to the game. The religion system is part of the game,
though.

    I'm not so sure about this one, but it is doable if using the
open-ended/relativistic stat scale you mentioned above. Personally I don't
think that the diety itself needs to be described, so much as the dieties
belief system/religion for the character that is a follower. If you want to
have Avatars (tm TSR) then you might need to descibe them as PC's so that
they can interact appropriately.

    Yes, but if you look at what I was saying above, this will lead to a
limited number of different scales that can be used to resolve statistical
situations.

    This was partly my point as well....

    True, but as you say below there are times when you don't want any
realism in the system. And unless you are designing a GURPS type kind of
game, you really don't need to worry about the scalability of realism
because the level (ar at least the upper bound) will be defined by the
flavor of the game and the genre.

    Thanks, for the compliment. And I agree, let's keep this talk going...
