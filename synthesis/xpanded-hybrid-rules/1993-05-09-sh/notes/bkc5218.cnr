Who, me?  Oh, I guess not.  But I'm gonna reply anyway.

		PHYSICAL	MENTAL
Strength	muscle		leadership
Coordination	dexterity	intelligence
Agility		agility		creativity
Health		endurance	willpower
Beauty		appearance	charm

The names (e.g., "muscle," "dexterity," and so on) aren't important here; it's
just the concept I'm demonstrating here.  I think it has merit.

Can anyone else think of any categories that are applicable to this model?

I'd like to make this a PD project, so that anything that is contributed to the
project becomes public domain material by default.  No one owns the project.

I someone decides to take the time to completely develop the patchwork ideas
here into a workable game system, hurrah for them!  I'd pay $15 for a
well-thought-out game that I helped design.  At least I'd know that the game
was what I wanted...

I haven't seen the GURPS rules in a couple years, and I've never seen the
TimeLords game, sorry... =)

I'd prefer to go with a system like Cyberpunk's:  roll d10, add a skill and the
applicable attribute, compare against a difficulty level.

Example: d10 + Pistol + Reflex

Well, those "poor unfortunates" can pay their $12 for the game.  They'll be
getting a laser printed copy with, hopefully, some nice charts and graphics.

What's the law on PD?  Can someone take material from the PD and copyright it,
thus prohibiting others from using the (once-PD) material without prior written
permission?
