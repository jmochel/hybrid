I understand what you mean, and all, but I don't like it much.  Though
attributes and skills can be treated similarly, I don't think they can be
treated equivalently.

One major weakness of your system is that all PCs would be identical, unless
they took skills.  And how would you differentiate between two characters who
both had the Strength/brawn skills?  Which is stronger?

Also, skills and attributes BOTH add to a character's chance of success.
Attributes affect a wide range of situations and are generally trait-like
(acquired in some part from birth).  Skills are more specifically applied, and
are generally learned.

Having both attributes and skills doesn't impose much figuring.  Only simple
arithmetic is needed -- if my system (AQ's) is used, then just add an attribute
and a skill stat, roll some dice, and compare.  Easy!

Right-o.  Let's go with "Strength," then.  Tomorrow, I'll repost the
"RPG: Attributes" message with all the suggested changes.

So, should I leave it as Quickness, and just change the Quickness description
to include Reflex?

There would be surprise situations where you might add-in Quickness,
Perception, or both.  Right?

I think Perception should be kept out of dodge rolls, just to keep it simple.
