After finishing the string... let me add a bit more, and perhaps change a few
things in my suggestion.   First, I have Agility in a category of its own.
We could easily divide this into manual dexterity and grace.  Again d100 for
Agility, plus 2d10 to split.  thus a thief could indeed be an artful cutpurse,
but, if he can't climb walls, he wont trip over his own two feet either.

Finally, add a stat for Willpower.  d100.  It wouldnt be under intellect,
because even the smartest people can be tempted to, say, play with internet all
week instead of studying for finals.

An example:  Hroth's player rolls the following on a d100 for the five major
             groups.

    44      29      87      82      60

             The player wants Hroth to be a fighter type so he assigns them
like this:
 Fitness: 87   this gives   Strength: 87   Endurance: 87
 Intellect: 44              Reasoning: 44  Knowledge: 44
 Willpower: 29
 Agility: 60                Manual Dex: 60 Grace:60
 Charisma: 82               Appearance: 82 Personality (Charm): 82

 This gives a basic definition.  He is very fit and healthy.  Not dumb, but not
smart.  Not clumsy, but not a Barishnikov.  Handsome, though, and funny; "nice"
Now, the player rolls the 2d10s.  He ends up with:
     3,4 (7)   8,2 (10)   9,7 (16)   10,5 (15)
Again, Hroth is a fighter type so these are distributed as follows:

16 Fitness   87  and mod-   Str: (+6) 93    End: (+10) 97
15 Intellect 44  ifies so   Reas: (+10) 59  Know: (+5) 49
   Willpower 29
16 Agility   60  that he    M.Dex: (+0)     Grac: (+16) 76
10 Charisma  82  gets:      App: (+3) 85    Per: (+7) 89

 So Hroth is quite strong and can keep going for a very long time; he certainly
isn't dumb, but he obviously didn't learn as much as he could have.  He's about
average, intellectually.  He can keep his feet most of the time, but he might
have trouble with origami.  He is handsome and very witty.  However, he is a
sucker for a beautiful girl.

Note:  d100 isn't vital to this.  I used that as an example; all games seem to
use d10s, so why not use JUST d10s?  This would give the game a good set of
stats to use for any given situation;  does he know a certain fairy tale? Know.
What happens when the barmaid gets flirtacious with him? Will.  How much damage
can he take?>  End.  He jumps off the edge of the roof and tries to catch the
ledge of the next building.  does he make it? M.Dex.  He jumps to the next
rooftop.  However, it is winter and there is a spot if ice.  Does he fall?
Grace.  And so on.

Comment away.                                 Michael baswell
