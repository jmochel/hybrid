\subsection{Physical Fatigue}

To recover physical fatigue (PFT) requires a Physical Endurance 
roll,  EF 4, towards a gain of 1 Fatigue. This roll can be made once 
every 5 minutes. After the first roll is made the EF of each 
subsequent roll goes up by 1. 

\subsection{Physical Endurance}

To recover Physical Endurance (PEN) requires a Physical Endurance 
roll, EF -2, towards a gain of 1 PEN.  This roll can be made once 
every 10 hours. After the first roll is made the EF of each 
subsequent roll goes up by 1. 

\subsection{Mental Fatigue}

To recover mental fatigue (MFT) requires a mental Endurance 
roll,  EF 4, towards a gain of 1 Fatigue. This roll can be made once 
every 5 minutes. After the first roll is made the EF of each 
subsequent roll goes up by 1. 

\subsection{Mental Endurance}

To recover mental Endurance (MEN) requires a mental Endurance 
roll, EF -2, towards a gain of 1 MEN.  This roll can be made once 
every 10 hours. After the first roll is made the EF of each 
subsequent roll goes up by 1. 

Healing can be augmented via medication, regeneration treatments, or 
meditation.
