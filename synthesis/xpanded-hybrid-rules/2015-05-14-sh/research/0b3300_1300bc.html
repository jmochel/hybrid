<hr width="100%">3,300BCE&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The beginning date of the
Mayan calendar. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(L.C.-W.P.p.2-3)<br>
3,300&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Around this time the
inhabitants of Sumer in present day Iraq adopted the practice of
storing tokens in sealed clay jars. The tokens represented the counts
of foodstuffs, livestock , and land. The stored tokens provided a more
permanent record but required that jars be broken in order to examine
the record. Then someone hit on the idea of making marks in the soft
clay covers of the jars to represent the tokens inside. Archeological
evidence shows that the marked jars led almost immediately to a system
of marks on clay tablets.<br>

3,300&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Archaic cylinder seals [of
Sumeria] of this time were later collected by financier Pierpont Morgan.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(SFC, 2/15/97, p.D1)<br>
c3300BCE&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; German hikers Erica and Helmut Simon found
a well-preserved prehistoric corpse, later named Otzi (Frozen Fritz),
on Sep 19, 1991, in a glacier on the Hauslabjoch Pass, about 100 yards
from Austria in northern Italy. It was kept at the Univ. of Innsbruck
for study. In 1998 analysis indicated that the Ice Man had internal
parasites and carried the woody fruit of a tree fungus as a remedy.
Tattoos on the body were also found to be placed over areas of active
arthritis. A flint arrow was also found in his back.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(SFC, 4/27/96, p.A-5)(SFC, 12/25/98, p.A4)(SFEC,

<br>
3,300-3,200BCE&nbsp; In 1998 clay tablets were reported from this date
from the tomb of a king named Scorpion. The tablets had writing that
recorded linen and oil deliveries as a tithe to the king. The tomb was
in a cemetery at Gebel Tjauti in Suhag province, some 250 miles south
of Cairo. Egyptologists John Coleman Darnell and wife Deborah
discovered the tableau in 1995.<br>

<br>
3300-1000&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The earliest known civilizations occupied
the Aegean world. The Minoan and Mycenaean civilizations rose and fell
over this period.<br>

3,200BCE&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Semitic people come to the area around
Byblos, Lebanon. It was then called Gebal and the people Giblites, who
with flat axes cut timber from the mountains.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(NG, Aug., 1974, p.174)<br>
c3200BCE&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;A white limestone vase was made depicting
Sumerians offering gifts to the goddess Innin along with scenes of
daily life in Uruk. It survived for thousands of years and came to be
called the Sacred Vase of Warka.<br>

circular constructs, are enigmatic features of Neolithic and Bronze age
Britain.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(SFC,11/11/97, p.A12)<br>
3200-1600BCE&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Indus Valley civilization grew up
along the banks of the Indus River in what is now Pakistan. The cities
of Harappa and Mohenjo-Dara showed the development of multi-level
houses and city-wide plumbing. A natural disaster that altered the
course of the Indus River appears to have brought about the collapse of
this civilization.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(eawc, p.1)<br>
<br>
3,100BCE&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Menes, the legendary first pharaoh of Egypt,
ruled upper Egypt from Nekhen before he conquered lower Egypt and moved
his capital to Memphis.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(NG, May 1985, R. Caputo, p.586)<br>
c3100 BCE &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The upper and lower kingdoms were united
to form the 1st Dynasty of Egypt. The fertile Nile Valley and
prevailing environmental conditions led to the formation of villages
along the river&#8212;Upper Egypt in the south and Lower Egypt in the north.
These villages grew into 'kingdoms' centered around Naqadah (later
Hierakonopolis) in the south and Behdet (later Buto) in the delta.
According to tradition, the upper and lower kingdoms were united into
one centralized government by King Menes around 3100 BCE. However,
modern scholars are unsure whether King Menes was actually several
kings, including Narmer and Aha. Menes' reign lasted a substantial 62
years before being killed by a hippopotamus (again according to
tradition).&nbsp; The 1st dynasty lasted until about 2890 BCE.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(HNQ, 11/2/00)<br>
c3,100BCE&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In the protodynastic period of Egypt
"Scorpion" ruled&nbsp; and was followed by Narmer.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(R4,1998)<br>
3100BCE&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Cuneiform writing emerged in Mesopotamia. The
wedge-shaped characters were used to record the first epics in world
history, including "Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta," and the first
stories about "Gilgamesh."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(eawc, p.1)<br>
3100BCE&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Writing was related to Sumerian language. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(V.D.-H.K.p.10)<br>
3100BCE&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The first known incarnation of Stonehenge,
the ancient stone monument in the south of England, is thought to have
been built by native Neolithic peoples around this time. Archaeological
interpretation of the site is primarily based on a series of modern
excavations carried out since 1919. The studies have concluded that
there were three different building periods representing markedly
different materials and methods. Stonehenge I was primarily an earthen
structure built by native Neolithic peoples using deer antlers as
picks. Two entry stones were also placed to the northeast of the
circle, one of which (the "Slaughter Stone") survives in the latest
monument. <br>

abstract curving stroke of a snake. It is now in the French Louvre.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(WSJ, 1/29/98, p.A16)<br>
<br>
3100-2500BCE&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The village of Skara Brae on the Orkney
mainland was inhabited continuously over this time. Inhabitants were
settled farmers who ate sheep, cattle, grain and fish.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(SFEC, 3/23/97, p.T3)<br>
<br>
c3050&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In Egypt Hor-Aha ruled and

3000BCE&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The use of coca in Bolivian culture can be
traced back to at least this time. It is commonly called hoja sagrada,
or sacred loaf.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(SFC, 6/29/00, p.A12)<br>
c3000BCE&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In Britain timber temples were constructed
prior to stone circles. Remains of one was found in 1997 at Stanton

c3000BCE&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Thoth developed the Egyptian calendar whose
year begins with the autumn equinox. The year was divided into 12
months of 30 days with 5 or 6 days added at the end but not counted as
a part of any month.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(K.I.-365D)<br>
3000BCE&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Egyptians used reed brushes on papyrus to
write hieroglyphics.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(SFC, 7/26/04, p.F4)<br>
c3,000BCE&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Ayurveda, a holistic Indian science, had
its beginnings. It later taught that the balancing of the mind, spirit
and body is the secret of health, vitality, longevity and beauty.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(SFC, 4/25/00, p.C6)<br>
c3,000BCE&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Hatha Yoga, a combination of mind and body
exercises, began in India about this time.<br>

c 3,000BCE&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In the area of present Lithuania at the
end of the 3rd millennium a new wave of nomadic cattle-raisers moved in
from the south and south-west and brought with them a corded pottery
culture.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(DrEE, 10/12/96, p.2)<br>
c3,000BCE&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;A Neolithic temple at Mnajdra, Malta, dates
to this time.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(AM, 7/01, p.15)<br>
c3,000BCE&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The goddess as a cultural figure began
losing power about this time as the process of reading and writing
developed. In 1998 Dr. Leonard Shlain published "The Alphabet Versus
the Goddess: The Conflict Between Word and Image."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(SFC, 1/19/99, p.B1)<br>
c3000BCE&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;On the Orkney mainland the 12 Stones of
Stennes were built about this time.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(SFEC, 3/23/97, p.T3)<br>
c3000BCE&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Gold and silver began to be refined via
cupellation, a process that produces 300 parts lead for every part
silver.<br>

c3000BCE&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Bituminous surface deposits were exploited
in the Near East as early as this time.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(AM, Mar/Apr 97 p.56)<br>
3000 BCE&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;It is suspected by Earth scientists that the
sun shone particularly brightly about this time. This episode is called
the Altithermal, and may have contributed to the rise of the early
civilizations. Another similar high heat episode occurs around 1000 CE.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(NOHY, 3/90, p.127)<br>
c3000BCE&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Scientists say that the weather changed
about this time and that the first El Nino Pacific Ocean temperature
flip occurred. Analysis of Peruvian coastal middens of this period
indicated a diet change from tropical mollusks to cold water mollusks.
The idea was first proposed in 1983 and evidence was added from Japan
and Greenland. Skeptics claim that the change was due to mollusks
harvested from now vanished warm water lagoons.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(SFC, 9/13/96, p.E2)<br>
3,0000BCE&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Urartu existed in eastern Anatolia starting

the collapse of the temple culture.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(AM, Jul/Aug '97 p.44)<br>
<br>
3000-2000BCE Bronze might have been invented in ancient Afghanistan
around this time. True urban centers rose in two main sites in
Afghanistan--Mundigak, and Deh Morasi Ghundai. Mundigak (near modern
day Kandahar) had an economic base of wheat, barley, sheep and goats.
Also, evidence indicates that Mudigak could have been a provincial
capital of the Indus valley civilization. Ancient Afghanistan was a
crossroads between Mesopotamia, and other Civilizations.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(www.afghan, 5/25/98)<br>
3000-2000BCE&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Early Minoan civilization, centering
around Crete, named after the legendary Cretan king. Early, middle, and
late are periods divided by Sir Arthur Evans. Pottery was decorated
with incised or pricked patterns filled in with white powdered gypsum
to make a pattern on a black background up to this time. Early Minoan I
began to make colored decoration. Ornament was restricted to simple
geometrical patterns. The pottery was made without a wheel. In this
period short, triangular daggers in copper are found. In Early Minoan
II Pottery designs are more free and graceful, simple curves appear.
The potter's wheel was introduced. Rude and primitive idols in marble,
alabaster, and steatite are found, but the use of flint and obsidian
was not wholly abandoned. Early Minoan III begins to show seals with a
kind of hieroglyphic signs upon them, apparently imitated from Egyptian
seals.<br>

Gilgamesh." In 1844 Westerners discovered an epic poem based on
Gilgamesh on stone fragments in Mosul, Iraq. 5 Sumerian versions were
later acknowledged. The 1st part of the poem was published in 1876. In

change can be most easily accounted for by the assumption that the art
passed from one race to another. And the sudden disappearance of
fine-line technique coincides so completely with the subjugation of the
Philistines, that we can hardly hesitate to painted ware displaying the

1347-1338BCE&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Tutankhamun, Pharaoh of Egypt, ruled for
nine years. He was followed by King Ay, and then a soldier named
Horemhab, whom some regard as the last Pharaoh of the Eighteenth
Dynasty while others think he was the founder of the Nineteenth.
Horemhab is thought to have prevented the dynastic marriage of
Ankhesnamun [Ankhesenamen], the widow of Tutankhamun, to prince
Zananza, son of the Hittite king, Suppilliliumas. Documents discovered
at the Hittite capital of Boghaz-Koy in Turkey prove beyond doubt that
the young queen was writing to Suppililiumas imploring him to send her
one of his sons so that she might make him King of Egypt. It is
suspected that the young prince was killed on his was to Egypt under
the orders of Ay or Horemhab. Howard Carter discovered the tomb of
Tutankhamen.<br>
