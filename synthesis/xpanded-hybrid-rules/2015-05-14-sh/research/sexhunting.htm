<P>     Marvin Harris, one of the Twentieth Century’s most controversial anthropological minds, scrutinizes the effects and causation factors of gender specific roles in the chapter entitled, &quot;Sex, Hunting, and Deadly Force,&quot; excerpted from, &quot;Our Kind.&quot; Harris suggests that the biological differences between the sexes accounts, in large proportions, for the roles that males and females accept in a given culture. Harris believes that the roles of men and/or women are determined by physical attributes and limitations, as decreed by nature and environment.  Harris states women do act as food gatherers through small game hunting and collecting fruits and grains. He further contends the male role as the hunter of large game and as dominators over the female counterparts, stems from the male’s role as manufacturers of implements of destruction. He cites the works of other renowned anthropologists, notably, Eleanor Leacock and her work in Labrador among the Montagnais- Naskapi, Colin Turnball and his studies in the field with the Mbuti of Zaire, and Marjorie Shostak’s and Richard Lee’s work among the !Kung, as examples of near egalitarian relationships. However, Marvin Harris is quick to point out that the equality of the sexes in these studies never reaches full egalitarian status. He also pronounces that these aforementioned cultures were studied under conditions in which some semblances of authoritarian rule exist. Harris asserts that under conditions where no civil rule was present, males, as the makers and wielders of lethal weapons, would completely dominate the female constitutes of the respective culture. </P>
<P>     While Marvin Harris’s reputation and standing in the academic community are to be noted, it is interesting that, in the unlearned opinion of this undergraduate, his argument, while compelling, is not without some room for doubt. His data may not draw as true a picture as it seems, his views contradicts too many of those who are as learned as himself, and/or his analysis seems to be biased and self-serving.</P>
<P>     Harris relates statistical data describing the male anatomical domination over the female. While these figures show obvious male characteristics that would indicate a male role of big game hunter, protector, and provider, Harris’s contention that this data, coupled with the assumption that the sex with the deadliest weapons is the alpha, seems a bit too trite. While the cultural traditions are beyond denial, it would seem, that since humans are advanced forms in the animal kingdom, and while in some species the male is merely a sex object to be consumed, or avoided when that purpose is achieved, it may be by a simple twist of biological fate that the human species is male dominate. After all, studies have indicated the female members of the species tend to have greater strength against pain (Hinman, 1998) and considering that big game hunting must surely be rated high in terms of painful injuries, a ripple in the gene pool could have reversed the roles.</P>
<P>     Harris cites several of his esteemed colleagues in his discussion, then proceeds to disregard or overrule their theories in favor of his own, or according to, &quot;my reading of ethnographic evidence…(Harris, 280). It is also interesting to note that Harris states, &quot;… I cannot agree with Eleanor Leacock and other feminist anthropologists who claim that gender roles in foraging societies are completely egalitarian (Harris, 280).&quot; Marvin Harris has every right and the credentials to disagree, however this statement leaves one to wonder if counterparts with more male chromosomes had done the research, if Harris would have been a bit more eclectic. </P>
<P>     This is not to say that Marvin Harris is wrong or not justified in his belief that the men who control the weapons and naturally possess the brawn, would dominate through terror. There is amble evidence, even in today’s police blotters, to indicate that this premise is probably true. Harris’s use of anatomical data, while compelling, seems to fall short of giving a complete picture of the physical differences that allow for the male to assume the role of big game hunter. Moreover, his overall analysis of the causation factors contradicts those of other respected leaders in the field and the statement of disregard of the feminist point of view tends to weaken, rather than, strengthen his argument. Further research might be necessary in order for the casual reader to be aptly informed to make a careful decision.  </P>
