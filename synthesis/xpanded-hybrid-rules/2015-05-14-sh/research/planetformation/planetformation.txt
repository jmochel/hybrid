                         Bibleography of Articles related to Planet Formation



     Here is a listing of the various articles that were useful in providing information about the theories of planet formation. Some provided details used in the algorithms of my
     program to model certain effects. Others provided background information useful in understanding the process by which a solar nebula evolves into a system of planets. If
     you have an interest in this area I recommend them to you. Also try NASA ADS Article Service to find articles on this topic.

     note: the first two articles by James Arnold were essential in providing algorithms to determine the probability of an encounter between two bodies in intersecting orbits.
