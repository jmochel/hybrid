<hr width="100%">1CE&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Dec 25, The
celebrated birth of Christ in Bethlehem. The birth of Jesus is
celebrated on Dec. 25th because the Romans needed to replace the pagan
holiday called the Feast of the Unconquered Sun. In Ethiopia Jan 7 is
the day that Christmas is celebrated. According to the gospel of
Matthew Joseph soon fled with his family to Egypt following a decree by
Herod that ordered all boys of Bethlehem under age 2 to be put to
death. [see 2-6 BC]<br>

Church of the Holy Sepulchre. In 1998 Robert Funk and the Jesus Seminar

30CE &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;When the Roman governor of
Palestine was confronted by an angry Jewish crowd demanding the
execution of the leader of a small, radical religious movement, like
Socrates, he cross-examined him. When he asked him if he was a king,
the man replied, "To this end I was born, and for this cause I came
into the world, to bear witness to the truth. Everyone that belongs to
the truth will hear me." The governor, being a Roman, answered as any
educated Roman would. For Pontius Pilate had been raised on the Greek
and Roman skeptical traditions that denied that there was anything like
certain truth, only probable knowledge. So, as any other Roman would
have done, he asked the question, "What is truth?," but received no
answer. In 2000 Ann Wroe authored the historical novel "Pontius Pilate."<br>

was eminently qualified for this martial task. He was fresh from

played a significant role in the conquest of Britannia (Britain) by
Nero&#8216;s predecessor. Joseph, meanwhile had assembled his own army from
the rebel bands of Galilee and trained them in the Roman model. He also
fortified many towns, the strongest being Jotapata, a natural fortress
perched on a rock outcrop.&nbsp; It was surrounded on three sides by
steep valleys that made attack virtually impossible. The only approach

celebrated Samhain on October 31 as the end of the season of the sun
and the beginning of the season of darkness. It was believed that on
this day the souls of the dead revisited their homes. Bonfires were lit

the traditions of Samhain to form a major fall festival at the end of
October.<br>

205-270CE&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Plotinus was an Alexandrian philosopher in
Rome and founder of Neo-Platonism, which strongly influenced the later
Augustine, who taught of a mystical union with the Good through the
exercise of pure intelligence. He founded Neo-Platonism, a religion
that for a time rivaled Christianity. Neo-Platonism developed out of
the philosophical doctrines of Plato in the fourth century B.C.
Plotinus developed the spiritual side of Plato's thought into a
mystical philosophy teaching reunion with the One and that material
things are unworthy. Saint Augustus, formerly a Neo-Platonist, brought
some of his ideas into Christian theism.<br>

executed another St. Valentine around the same time. The Catholic
Bishop Valentine was clubbed, stoned and beheaded by Emperor Claudius
II for refusing to acknowledge the monarch&#8217;s outlawing of marriage. The
Catholics then made Valentine a symbol to oppose the Roman mid-February
custom in honor of the God Lupercus, where Roman teenage girls&#8217; names
were put in a box and selected by young Roman men for "sex toy" use
until the next lottery. The two Valentines merged into a single
legendary patron of young lovers. St. Valentine&#8217;s Day evolved from
Lupercalia, a Roman festival of fertility.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Valentine's Day probably has its
origins in the Roman feast of Lupercalia, which was held on February
15. One of the traditions associated with this feast was young men
drawing the names of young women whom they would court during the
following year--a custom that may have grown into the giving of
valentine's cards. Another legend associated with Valentine's Day was
the martyrdom of the Christian priest St. Valentine on February 14. The
Roman emperor believed that men would remain soldiers longer if they
were not married, but Valentine earned the wrath of the emperor by
secretly marrying young couples. The first American publisher of
valentines was printer and artist Esther Howland, who sold elaborate
handmade cards for as much as $35 at the end of the 19th century.
Complex and beautiful machine-made cards brought the custom of
valentine exchanging within the reach of many Americans.<br>
