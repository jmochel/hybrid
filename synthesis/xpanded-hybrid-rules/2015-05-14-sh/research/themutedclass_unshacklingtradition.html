<FONT SIZE=4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dominant groups dominate discourse. Subordinated groups whose discourse differs from the dominant mode may not be heard; Edwin Ardener  (1975) termed them "muted groups". Shirley Ardener explained, in her introduction to <I>Defining Females </I> (1978), that muted groups are not deficient in their capacity for language, nor are they necessarily more quiet than the dominant group. "The 'mutedness' of one group may be regarded as the inverse of the 'deafness' of the dominant group, as the 'invisibility' of the former's achievements is an expression of the 'blindness' of the latter. Words which continually fall upon deaf ears may, of course, in the end become unspoken, or even unthought" (S. Ardener 1978:20). I want to suggest here that the concept of mutedness is a powerful entr&eacute;e into the field of scholarship focusing on women, whether we are discussing women as subjects of research or women as scholars.<P>

</CENTER></H3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us first note that in 1989, the Modern Language Association published a handbook on <I>Language,Gender, and Professional Writing</I> (Frank and Treichler 1989) that gave its imprimatur to the standard of non-sexist writing. The handbook illustrated the absurdity of traditional formal practice with excerpts such as this:<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The central issue in man's evolution was bipedalism. When man thrust himself erect, he truly became <I>Homo erectus</I>: for he discovered front-to-front copulation. And woman in her turn was rewarded by orgasm, unknown to all other species (Frank and Treichler 1989:189).<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not to mention,  "Man, being a mammal, breast-feeds his young" (Frank and Treichler 1989:4). These examples do more than flag foolishness; from the Ardeners' perspective, they show how thoroughly the dominant class has expropriated the accomplishments of the subordinated class, in this case, of women.<BR>
We who are women are members of a class for whom formal higher education was until this century generally proscribed. What was on top of our heads -- our long and tediously arranged hair -- was our crowning glory; what was inside our heads was muted. Take this 1921 note from a male professor at Smith College:<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Mme. Curie is to be here tomorrow. . . . The average student, however, <I>I imagine</I> to be much more interested in the Prom. . . . These students seem much less interested in the  pursuit of learning than in avoiding as far as possible its pursuit of them (quoted in Rossiter 1982:357 n. 59; my italics).<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The philosopher Marjorie Glicksman Grene recounts a story typical of women who persisted in scholarly interests rather than Proms:<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Alasdair MacIntyre . . . was lecturer in philosophy . . . when . . . I myself fell luckily into a   temporary lectureship. . . . I was teaching Descartes to Kant . . . and MacIntyre had   drummed into the students the thesis "There is no philosophy from St. Thomas to Hegel."   Every time I came close to convincing the class that something in <I>my</I> period was worth attending to, I could just see their dear little minds ticking over:  "But MacIntyre says there <I>is</I> no philosophy from St. Thomas to Hegel" (Grene 1986:356).</BLOCKQUOTE><P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parenthetically, we can point out that Grene's notion of luck seems rather perverse. She studied at Harvard, at Freiburg with Heidegger and at Heidelberg with Jaspers, and upon completing her doctorate (in 1935), wrote to 129 schools seeking a position. "[N]obody gives jobs to women in philosophy," she was told, but a small junior college did take her, and then the University of Chicago as an instructor during World War II, until the boys came back and she was, as she says, "forcibly retired".  For fifteen years, she was "exiled from her profession," struggling on a "shabby, back-breaking, debt-ridden farm" until Michael Polanyi hired her as his research assistant in Manchester (Grene 1986:355-356).   <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The standard histories of archaeology seem to avoid as far as possible the pursuit of identifying women's contributions to the discipline.  Willey and Sabloff's sole reference, in their <I>History of American</I><U> <I></U>Archaeology</I>, to Memoir No. 1 of the Society for American Archaeology, the work of a woman, is via somebody else's citation:<P>
<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"It was John W. Bennett who realized the functionalist implications of Martin's and Rouse's writings. In 1943, he published an article . . .in which . . .he referred to archaeological uses of the concept of <I>acculturation</I>, by T. M. N. Lewis and Madeline Kneberg in Tennessee (1941) and by D. L. Keur (1941) in the southwestern United States" (Willey and Sabloff 1980:135; their italics).<P>
</BLOCKQUOTE> <P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened to Dorothy Keur?  She gave up attempting to work in archaeology and used her husband's connections to carry out ethnographic study -- pioneering study, as had been her Big Bead Mesa  work -- in Holland and the Caribbean. And Madeline Kneberg? She and Lewis rate a second reference (Willey and Sabloff 1980: 138) via Walter Taylor's praise of them.  <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the 1987 Carbondale conference "Writing the History of Archaeology", I brought up Willey and Sabloff's muting of women's contributions. In the published version of the conference, editor Andrew Christenson (1989:76) states, "of 562 individuals whose gender I could determine in the index of Willey and Sabloff (1980), 31 (6%) were female and of 405 individuals in Daniel's (1981) index, only 12 (3%) were female." Christenson continues (1989:76-77), "These data do not necessarily indicate any gender bias in these volumes because we do not know the actual gender ratio of archaeologists for the times and locations covered." Ratios seem hardly relevant beside the historical fact that Keur's monograph inaugurated the memoir series of the preeminent organization of American archaeologists.     <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I began planning a women's studies' course in my university, it seemed to me that the course could best be considered revisionist history. I wanted to share with the students information on interesting people who had raised radical questions. This to me was another way of teaching anthropology, the discipline that raises profoundly radical questions about human nature and societies. My students had read about Tom Paine, I wanted them to know the ideas and the tragic life of his fellow writer for the <I>Analytical Review</I>, Mary Wollstonecraft (whose <I>Vindication of the Rights of</I> <I>Women</I>  appeared in 1790, a year before Paine's <I>Rights of Man</I>. They had heard of Susan B. Anthony and perhaps Elizabeth Cady Stanton, two respectable middle-class ladies, and I wanted them to hear about Victoria Claflin Woodhull, not respectable in the eyes of the dominant class but the first woman to run for president of the United States (with ex-slave Frederick Douglass as her running mate), first woman stockbroker on Wall Street, first to publish in America an English translation of Marx and Engels'<I>Communist Manifesto</I>.  Revisionist history is the history of muted groups.   <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about the anthropology component of my course?  Revisionist anthropology? I did use that term in a paper in <I>Current Anthropology </I> in 1981 (Kehoe 1981). There I challenged the standard view of American Indians as largely non-agricultural, arguing that our Eurocentric picture of agriculture obstructed our recognition of the alternative agricultural practices developed in America. Jennings (1975) had labeled colonist entrepreneur' blindness to American Indian accomplishments the "cant of conquest," and Trigger (1980) made it quite clear that American archaeologists' conventional interpretations of American Indian history uncritically perpetuate racist
<P>

<H3>Page 25
</H3>
images. Indians, like Americans of African descent, are relegated to castes labeled "primitive" and therefore to be without histories. Coupled with historians' reluctance to recognize historical knowledge in the discourse of Indians (cf. e.g., Berthong 1989) the first nations of our continent have been effectively muted for half a millennium.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In social anthropology, the work of Jane C. Goodale on <I>Tiwi Wives</I>  (1971) published eleven years after the conventional analysis on the Tiwi by her fellow graduate student Arnold Pilling, and the more recent <I>Women of Value, Men of Renown</I> by Annette Weiner (1976) are certainly revisionist anthropology. In each case, a woman anthropologist worked among the same people studied by male anthropologists, and in each case she obtained the obverse of their pictures of the societies. Tiwi women, Goodale found, marry younger men. Kiriwina men, Weiner found, work to provide means for their wives to present themselves as persons of value. Women, it was demonstrated, were muted in the studies of male anthropologists, not so much because they as men were excluded from women's rituals, but more so because they paid little attention to women's activities, premising a priori that only men's activities would figure significantly in understanding the society. Goodale and Weiner threw off the shackles of this tradition when they gave voice to the muted class.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victoria Claflin Woodhull dramatically proves that class, as well as gender and caste, biases mute much of human history. Claflin's father was a stablehand and horse trader, her mother a house servant. To earn a few bucks, the parents exhibited Victoria and her sister Tennie as imitation Fox Sisters on the mid-nineteenth-century county fair circuit. Entirely without formal education, Victoria became an effective orator, invited by Congressman Benjamin Butler to herself read before the House Judiciary Committee her memorial arguing that the recently passed Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to the Constitution gave the vote to women. (Her interpretation rested on the fact that women are members of the human race, and race membership, she pointed out, cannot be used to deny the franchise). Cady Stanton admired Claflin and attempted to link her crusades to the National Women's Suffrage Association. The Association would have nothing to do with the woman they denounced as a Free Lover and excoriated (quite inconsistently) as the accuser of Henry Ward Beecher, America's most-admired minister. (Claflin published, in her weekly newspaper,  the adultery case brought by Beecher's assistant Theodore Tilton against his employer.) Stanton was forced to drop her alliance with Claflin. When it is remembered that the Woman's Suffrage Association membership overlapped considerably with the eugenics movement, the acceptance of these ladies' campaigns in the standard histories of the dominant class is obvious. Giving the vote to women threatened the rationale of dominance by literate propertied Western European men, but Anthony and Cady Stanton pleaded that their votes could strengthen their class's power. Claflin and her associates, on the other hand, demanded an end to the false consciousness fostered by that class. Challenging bourgeois cultural dominance was a truly subversive act, a real rebellion. Claflin was imprisoned and then induced into exile.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gender, class, caste:  each attribute is used to mute the presence of millions of persons destined to subordination under the ideology of the dominant class of propertied Western European men. Legal scholars are now discussing critical legal histories that one practitioner, Mari Matsuda has termed "outsider jurisprudence." She says her term is preferable to "minority" because that "belies the numerical significance of the constituencies typically excluded from jurisprudential discourse" (Matsuda 1989:2323 n. 15). "Outsider jurisprudence" is a powerful departure from dominant discourse. "Minority" is part of the dominant structure -- the word is meaningless without inclusion in the larger whole -- and "revisionist" still tries to remain in the canon. "Outsider" asserts exclusion, it forces recognition that there<I> are </I>universes outside the dominant cosmology. The position is subtly and masterfully developed by Robert A. Williams, Jr., a Lumbee: "The ultimate goal of such a scholarship is to rediscover through this disinterring act our own discrete insurrectionist discourses suppressed by the tyranny of totalizing visions of knowledge and power" (Williams 1987:104).  <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another legal scholar, Joan C. Williams, emphasizes the insurrectionist foundation of outsider discourses when she claims that they attack and undermine the theory of possessive individualism central to modern dominant discourse. "The term," she explains, "refers to the liberal premises that society consists of market relations, and that freedom means freedom from any relations with others except those relations the individual enters voluntarily with a view to his own self-interest" (J. Williams 1989:810; she takes the term from C.B. Macpherson, <I>The Political Theory of Possessive</I><U> <I></U>Individualism</I>, 1962). This theory of possessive individualism pervades mainstream anthropology, from the expectation that economic analyses will be prominent in ethnographies, to the lower evolutionary standing assigned to societies that seem not to privilege market relations and, at the extreme, the acceptance of sociobiology. Because it converts to subhuman status persons (slaves, serfs, peons, laborers, discriminated "racial" groups,

<P>
<HR>
<H3>Page 26</H3>
women, children (Haraway 1991:145-147)) who are not free to enter into market relations with a view to their own self-interest, it promotes the continuing dominance of propertied European men. The damning evidence for the cruel self-interest maintained by the dominating discourse lies right in our Declaration of Independence and Constitution, where the authors write of the "self-evident . . . inalienable right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness," then count slaves as three-fifths of a man and refuse the franchise or the full protection of the Constitution to women. <BR>
<BR>
<H3><CENTER>Dominant Discourse in Scholarship<BR>
</CENTER></H3>
<B><BR>
</B>Drawn largely from the professional and upper classes (Ryan and Sackrey 1984), academic researchers tend to accept the tenet of possessive individualism as naturally as Kabyles accept their habitus (cf. Bourdieu 1977:72-95). The "marketplace of ideas" is more than a metaphor; scholars' ideas are indeed their working capital (Barnes 1977), and the relations of competition premised in the Western concept of the market lie unconformably with the ideal of selfless cooperation once propounded by Robert Merton. Cartels in academia are most visible in citation cliques (Cribb 1980), but they build through a more fundamental exclusionary strategy, the definition of what is to count as relevant discourse.  <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alasdair MacIntyre's hegemonic strategy can be glimpsed even in the recent book <I>Engendering Archaeology</I>, edited by Gero and Conkey (1991). The editors declare that in 1987, "There was simply no archaeological literature to cite as contributions, nor was there any defined circle of experts to fall back upon"; only "A tiny smattering of literature identified the <I>existence</I> of women in prehistory" (Gero and Conkey 1991:xi, their italics). Presumably the smattering consisted of the six studies focusing on inferring gender from prehistoric archaeological data, selected for recommendation in the article "Incorporating Gender into Archaeology Courses," (Spector and Whelan 1989) published after a three-year, well-publicized development project begun in 1985. That article cited, of course, the path-breaking methodological paper presented at the 1977 Plains Conference by Janet Spector  and subsequently published in the resulting volume, <I>The Hidden Half</I>, edited by Albers and Medicine (1983). <I>Choice</I>, the librarians' journal, selected <I>The Hidden Half</I> as one of the top ten academic books published in 1983. The research tradition inaugurated by Spector's paper was reinforced at the 1987 Plains Conference in a session organized by Marcel Kornfeld and published as Memoir 26 of the <I>Plains Anthropologist</I>  (Kornfeld 1991) . That same year, a session at the American Anthropological Association annual meeting featured five papers on inferring gender from the archaeological record, and this session, too, has been published (Nelson and Kehoe 1990). Mesoamericanists' work "engendering archaeology" saw print in 1988 as <I>The Role of Gender in Precolumbian Art and Architecture</I>, edited by Virginia Miller. And most obviously, Marija Gimbutas' explicitly gendered <I>The Goddesses and Gods of Old Europe</I> had been published in 1974 (second edition, 1982). There was, in 1986, no "defined circle of experts" on archaeological identification of gender roles in prehistoric societies, but there were a number of concerned researchers.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ironically, it was in the landmark volume <I>The Socio-Politics of Archaeology</I> , co-edited by Gero (Gero, Lacy and Blakey  1983), that Wobst and Keene described "Archaeological Explanation as Political Economy" (Wobst and Keene 1983) .  They emphasized the "superb fit" of precisely the research for which Conkey is noted with the "political economy" of the profession of archaeology, describing the strategy she used, of selecting "the Paleolithic of the periglacial Upper Pleistocene," as likely "[t]o be particularly successful . . . in achiev[ing] control . . . [and causing] other archaeologists . . . to have become enmeshed within a cone of dependence, deference, and predetermination where before they had enjoyed relative explanatory independence." The greater one's success in this political economy, they state, "the higher will be one's citation count" (Wobst and Keene 1983:82-84). Gero and Conkey invited "researchers who had a solid and demonstrated working knowledge either of specific classes of archaeological data (e.g. ceramics, botanical remains, shellfish) and/or of particular perspectives in prehistory (e.g. complex hunter-gatherers, early agricultural societies)" (Gero and Conkey 1991:xii). Exactly as Wobst and Keene outline (1983:81-82), this strategy toward control of a career field chooses "classificatory behavior" (cf. Reiss 1982) from which "a series of statements is then contrived." How this constrains archaeological research and interpretation is confessed, in the Gero and Conkey volume, by Ruth Tringham, "My wish to retain respectability and credibility as a scientific archaeologist was stronger than my motivation to consider<P>
<HR>
<H3>Page 27</H3>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="./gfx/fig3_1.jpg"></CENTER>
<P>
gender relations" (Tringham 1991:95). Conkey elsewhere (1991:111-112) cites Wobst and Keene's paper to explain archaeologists' obsession with "origins," but seems not to recognize the reflections of the strategy they outline in her own career.<BR>
What must be foregrounded in our discussions of feminist critiques and gender-focused research in archaeology is the fundamental issue of alternative discourses (Haraway 1991:147; Wobst 1989). The "cone" strategy of commandeering discourse that Conkey discusses very well, if not reflexively, in her 1991 article is an exclusionary maneuver useful in the maintenance of dominance. From the perspective of outsider jurisprudence, who dominates--white upper-class male or white upper-class female--is beside the point. We can reject the hierarchy of dominance, the 'defined circle of experts," in toto. We can reject the early-modern Western worldview with its insistence on a monolithic centered discourse, and in its place, stipulate the kind of decentered, multiplex, dynamic interplay congruent with modern evolutionary biology and physics. We should assert the validity and viability of 'emergent, differentiating, self-representing, contradictory social subjectivities, with their claims on action, knowledge, and belief," as Haraway (1991:147) passionately urges. Not a canonical literature, but a praxis of research and stimulating discussion, an "archaeology of humans" (Wylie 1991:22) should be the goal nourished by a feminist consciousness.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back in the beginning of archaeology as a professional discipline, Sir John Lubbock pursued the strategy for hegemonic control, omitting citation of work he plagiarized in his establishment of the canon for prehistory (Kehoe 1991). Lubbock was a member of a small self-selected dining club of men openly plotting the takeover of the Royal Society, and in chronicling this group, historian Ruth Barton (1990:72, 81) remarks, "The X-Club devoted enormous energy to gaining power. It is less clear what the Club did with this power:  the records are patchy [but] . . . the greatest symbolic achievement of the X-Club was . . . a conflation of science, church and state," no less! Anthropology, even archaeology, are not the spinning-out of truth within ivory towers. From Asad (1973), Leacock (Etienne and Leacock 1980, Leacock and Safa 1986), and the burgeoning wave they set in motion in social anthropology, through the more recent reflective studies in archaeology (e.g., Fowler 1987, Hinsley 1981, Kehoe 1985, 1989, Kristiansen 1981, 1985, Sch&aacute;velzon 1988), the clear connection between the practice of mainstream anthropology and service to the dominant class in Western states has been amply, though far from exhaustively, demonstrated.
<P>

<H3>Page 28</H3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his brilliant critique of the New Archaeology, Gibbon (1989:180) concluded "that archaeology is a more uncertain, open, challenging and perhaps anxiety-ridden enterprise than our positivist heritage has indicated."<BR>
The grand gesture of embedding quotes from designated muted classes in our dominant discourse will neither absolve us from the moral obligation to listen, nor assist us toward deeper understanding of our species and ourselves. As scholars, we must resist control by favored schools of research, their mapped-out modes of discourse and quoting circles, as earnestly as we seek to uncover field data. Pure science is a virgin mother:  either a miracle unlikely to be met in our lives, or a chimera. Cold appraisal of the lovely vision is discomfiting but necessary if we are not to simply replace one elite group with another  politically astute privileged X-Club. <P>
<H3><CENTER>Conclusion<BR>
</CENTER></H3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we as anthropologists struggle to throw off the shackles of tradition, to hear the muted groups, to see the obscured,  we are fighting for the recognition of human worth to which Franz Boas committed his energies. Let us remember that in 1919, the traditionalists nearly cast out Boas from the American Anthropological Association (Pinsky 1988). Woman or man, we as anthropologists betray the best of our discipline if we blindly hew to the imperialist doctrines still embedded in the theories and only slowly fading from the practice of mainstream anthropology. We who are women particularly should engage in the historically sensitive, emic anthropology developed by Boas and his colleagues, so many of whom were, because of him, women.
<P>
<HR>
<H3>Page 29</H3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boas was an outsider. I think we might, following Matsuda and Rob Williams, say we are engaged in outsider anthropology. We risk never getting prestigious positions, seldom getting cited, seldom invited to participate in popular symposia, but outsiders do get to meet some of the world's most interesting and admirable people. After all, outsiders are by far the largest component of the population of planet Earth.<P>

1.  In Conkey's own research specialty, none other than the revered doyen l'Abb&eacute; Breuil published in 1949 a series of views of a remarkably gendered prehistory where women can be seen doing many activities they are later denied by modern archaeologists.  Perhaps his experiences with one of his most eminent pupils, Dorothy Garrod (Boyle et al. 1963), raised his consciousness of the importance of prominently considering gender roles in human history.  Perhaps we are seeing the quiet influence of Miss Mary Boyle.<BR>
