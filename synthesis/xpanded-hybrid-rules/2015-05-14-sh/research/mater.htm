<B><FONT SIZE=4><P><A NAME="intro">I. Basic Idea</A></P>
</B><P>Cultural Materialism is a scientific research strategy that prioritizes material, behavior and etic processes in the explanation of the evolution of human socio-cultural systems. It was first introduced in <U>The Rise of Anthropological Theory</U> (Harris, 1968). Marvin Harris is the originator and has been the main figure in cultural materialism. He insists that the primary task of anthropology is to give causal explanations for the differences and similarities in thoughts and behaviors of human groups. </P>

<P>1.<U> STEWARD(CULTURAL ECOLOGY)</B></U> </P>
<P>The basic element of cultural materialism comes from Steward’s cultural ecology: socio-cultural adaptation, a human population interacting with its environment.</P>
<P>However, in some points Harris disagrees with Steward.</P>
<B><P>A. Environment</B>: </P>
<P>Steward saw environment as passive background and as an influence on culture. Harris sees people and environment in interaction form one system. Because of this, Harris considers environmental changes while Steward did not. </P>
<B><P>B. Culture: </P>
</B><P>Steward conceived of cultures as sets of traits, while Harris sees culture more as a system, the different aspects of religion, politics, kinship as having interrelations. Therefore, while Steward tended to isolate different cultural practices into traits, Harris sees the practices as more interrelated, forming a system. </P>
<B><P>C. Society: </P>
</B><P>Steward thought of social organization, demography, and levels of integration as sub-sets of culture traits. Harris sees interrelations of different aspects of social organization that are systematic relations between the different kinds of groups, networks, status, and roles (</FONT><A HREF="http://www.des.ucdavis.edu/est133/133-131.htm">http://www.des.ucdavis.edu/est133/133-131.htm</A><FONT SIZE=4>).</P>
<B><P>2. <U>MARX(DIALECTICAL or HISTORICAL MATERIALISM)</U> </P>
</B><P>Cultural materialists are concerned with the causality in socio-cultural systems and hold that, to find it out, we have to study material constraints that human existence is subjected to. They come from the need to produce food or shelter and to reproduce population. These can be renamed as infrastructure. In that cultural materialists prioritize material constraints to explain the socio-cultural systems, they agree with Marxists’ historical or dialectical materialism. However, cultural materialism does not take the notion that anthropology must become part of a political movement aimed at destroying capitalism. Cultural materialism allows diverse political motivation. Cultural materialism does not think all cultural changes result from dialectical contradictions but think that cultural evolution results from the gradual accumulation of useful traits through a process of trial and error. </P>
<B><P>3. <U>SKINNER (BEHAVIOR PSYCHOLOGY, REDUCTIONISM)</P>
</B></U><P>Harris was also influenced by Skinner’s reductionism. Skinner, as a behavioral psychologist, wanted to explain everything, even art, religion, and language by simple mechanisms. He reduced the acknowledgedly complicated human personality as just stimulus-response. Harris worked in behaviorist psychology. He was also interested in people’s behavior and wants to explain every human behavior by his theory. &#9;&#9;</P>
<B><P><A NAME="theory">III. Theoretical Approach</A></P>
</B><P>Cultural materialism considers that all socio-cultural systems consist of three levels: infrastructure, structure and superstructure.</P>

<B><FONT SIZE=4><P>Infrastructural Determinism</B>: The major principle of cultural materialism is that the modes of production and reproduction determine structure and the structure determines superstructure. Giving the priority to infrastructure results from the fact that society adapts to the environment by the infrastructural practices. Harris argues that studies in anthropology should give infrastructure-focused studies the "strategic priority," because, if the goal of science is to find out lawlike generalizations, then one should start with the study about "the greatest direct restraints from the givens of nature"(Harris 1979:57). However cultural materialism does not hold that all system changes come from alternations in the infrastructure. Nor does cultural materialism argue that the structure and superstructure are just passive reactors. They do influence infrastructure. However, if changes in a superstructure or structure are not compatible with the existing modes of production and reproduction, those superstructural or structural changes do not work well. Infrastructural determinism proposes a probabilistic relationship among these three levels. Therefore when we notice a superstructural or structural change of a society, we have to look at its infrastructure first. Marvin Harris explains the collapse of Soviet and East European communism with this paradigm. (See Harris 1992)</P>
<P>&nbsp;<A NAME="epistemology"><B>IV. Epistemological Approach</A></P>
</B><P>Epistemological principles of cultural materialism are specific to the study of human sociocultural systems. For cultural materialists, sociocultural facts have four aspects.</P>
<P>&#9;Emics (phon<U>emic</U>)- native’s viewpoint</P>
<P>&#9;Etics (phon<U>etic</U>)- observer’s viewpoint</P>
<P>&#9;Behavior events - all the body motions</P>
<P>&#9;Mental events - all the thought and feelings</P>
<P>Cultural materialists divide the way of data collection and organization into emic and etic analyses. </P>
<U><P>Emic analysis</U> totally depends on an informant’s explanation. If informants agree on a description or interpretation of data, the data is considered correct. </P>
<U><P>Etic analysis</U> does not rely on an informant’s description alone, but on explication provided by many observers using agreed-on scientific measures. Emic and etic analyses can add mental and behavior analyses. Therefore they can be</P>
<P>The emics of behavior : Informant’s description about a native’s behavior.</P>
<P>The emics of thought : Informant’s description about a native’s thought.</P>
<P>The etics of behavior : Observer’s explication about a native’s behavior.</P>
<P>The etics of thought : Observer’s explication about a native’s thought.</P>
<P>Cultural materialism rejects the research strategy restricted to the emics of thought only, which is idealists’ favorite. Instead, cultural materialists think both emic and etic analyses should go together.</P>
<B><P>V. Methodology</P>
</B><P>Cultural materialism itself is a research methodology. It prefers</P>
<P>· Quantitative methods: Demography, caloric yields</P>
<P>· Ethnography</P>
<P>· Archeological research </P>
<P>· Etic as well as emic analyses.</P>
<B><P>VI. Issues</P>
</B><P>· Food and protein</P>
<P>· Food and evolution</P>
<P>· Demography, Population regulation</P>
<P>· Warfare, culture and environment</P>
<B><P>VII. Reaction</P>
</B><P>In the 1970’s when cultural materialism was introduced, American anthropology split into two groups: those who argued for the humanities and those, including cultural materialists, who advocated an anthropology modeled on natural science. Those who were opposite to cultural materialism argued that anthropology is a humanistic discipline. Geertz argued that "it is not an experimental science in search of law but an interpretive one in search of meaning"(Geertz 1973:5). Moore doubted the validity of the etic analysis, asking "how can we be so dismissive of the informant’s emic viewpoint if culture is rooted in values and meanings held by individuals?"(Moore 1996:200) Most of the reactions are against infrastructural determinism and the etic behavior priority analysis.</P>
