        <para>
        The Confederation of Systems, more commonly known as the 
        Confederation or Confed, is a collection of solar systems and colonies banded 
        together for both defense and trade. There has been a concerted 
        effort by the Confed to limit interference in the internal workings of the 
        actual systems.
        </para>
        <para>
        The Confed emcompasses a number of major racial groups. The Terrans 
        and the various derivative races of <emphasis> Homo Terra Prime</emphasis>  
        constitute a major portion of the current population.
        The Proxima Centaurans and the derivative races of <emphasis> Homo Proxima Centauran Prime </emphasis>
        make up the next largest population foloowed closely by the 
        Alpha Centaurans and the derivative races of <emphasis> Homo Alpha Centauran Prime</emphasis> 
        There are no other known races currently members of the Confed.
        </para>
        <para>
        The duties of the Confederation as a governing body are quite simple: 
        keep the peace <emphasis> between member systems </emphasis> To this end each system 
        donates a portion of its military services to the Confed as well as some monetary support.
