	Yes- Shotokan.  While I agree that SHotokan uses a lot less
defense than Aikido, it still teaches defense strongly.  I would like to see 
that represented.  MAybe it is enough for it to be a tertiary....

ALso I have been thinking of giving up the concept of "related skills"
and handle the entire process of non-level_factor-based inter-skill
relationships with:
double-secondaries(5%{6%?} per rank, possibly adds full speed bonus!)
full secondaries(3%?{4%?} per rank, adds half  speed bonus)
partial secondaries(2% pr rank, adds quarter speed bonuses)
tertiaries(1% per rnak, adds eigth speed bonuses{yes-you must have a ten!})

JUst brainstorming - what do you think?

On Defense:
Terms:(because I am confused)

Unactive defense or Non-defending:  Opponents ignore your DEF secondary stat;
              they are at +40 to hit you; you are at +30 to all physical 
              actions.
Active defense:  Opponents subtract your full DEF secondary stat as long as 
              you are aware of them and not reacting.  PCF perception
              acts as a tertiary to your DEF stat while you are active.
              Your defense skill adds 3% per rank to your secondary stat.
Applied Defense:  You are "using an action" to defend.  You may use your 
              PCF percetion as a secondary to the roll to perform the
              manuever.   Yor defesne skill is rolled as the primary skill.
              It takes 4 counts to perform this manuever.  Your opponent
              takes (-40-your DEF) or (-your DEF*2), whichever is higher.  

      WHen you are activiating your defense it takes no time- you only have
to announce it, and at the next reaction your defense will be activated.  
You may use the speed bonuses due to rank from your Defense skill to activate 
if you wish but then you must re-roll initiative.  The action will take a 
default therefore of one count.  

      When you are usaing applied defense you may use the full speed bonuses
due to rank to the initiative roll leadsing up to the defense manuever.  

SPEED BONUS for an applied defense equals =  SPD + (RANK in DEF-2) +
                                      (Rank in G: MARTIAL_ART-2)/2
Only add martial art if it is activated and if it applies to that martial art.

      Does that answer your questions mark?  IS that how you thought it worked?

From: uunet!umassmed.UMMED.EDU!glhodge (Geoffrey L. Hodge)

	Yeah.  I think all combat styles I can think of generally recommend
that you not let yourself get hit by your opponent.  They all get their
style as a tertiary to base defense.  I think that's pretty good.  Remember
that it can be doubled when using applied (active) defense.
	I think you should outline forms in the following way:  Decide what
skills they concentrate upon, what skills they teach, what skills they do
not (in pure form) teach.  I think many dojos actually steal moves from 
other styles to cover the weaknesses of their own, but you only need to deal
with the pure style.  There is no reason that a Shotokan instructor can't
teach all their students defense.  It just isn't one of the 5 (8, whatever)
main skills of Shotokan (or maybe it is, and some other skill is not).
	Perhaps what you ought to do is figure out what a 1 yr, 3 yr and
5 yr student would have for BT skills in various martial arts styles.  This
will help you decide what the main skills are, how many support skills a
martial artist will have at different levels, and how many main skills they
will have.  Then you can determine a flat number of main skills (and maybe
also support skills) that the style can be applied to as a secondary.
Anything else the style teaches will have the support of the style as a
tertiary.  Other skills can be taken (and might still be useful), but the
style would not add to them.

	I don't like your proposal for changing secondaries and tertiaties.
Part of this may just be your choice of terms, but I think you may be
introducing too many levels as well.  (I know you run many levels now, but
they are always at your discretion as GM.  If you are going to systematize
this, you ought to make it playable, IMO).  I find that 3 levels, at 5%,
3%, and 1% work out fairly well, although 3 levels is a bit cumbersome for
my tastes.  You shouldn't have a problem with it :-)  but I'm not sure about
four.  I would say that 5%, 3%, 1% gives you a good breakdown.  Skills should
probably not add more than half their full chance (5%/rank) unless they are
being used in place of the appropriate skill.
	I also don't like the terms double and partial secondary.  Why have
3 types of secondary and 1 type of tertiary.  I know you were just tossing
out ideas, and this may sound like quibbling, but I think that concise terms
will help reduce confusion (and apparent complexity).  How about secondary
partial secondary, tertiary and partial tertiary (if you must have 4)?
Or how about having "primary," "secondary," and "tertiary," "support skills?"
I don't know--now I'm just tossing out ideas--but I think that terminology
should be chosen carefully.

							-Jeff
From: uunet!juliet.ll.mit.edu!alexj

I agree completely that terms have to be chosen carefully.  I also agree
that partial-secondary and double-secondary are weak and aren't good terms.

I don't think three levels of relationship is too much.  It may not be enough. But for game mechanics sake I would keep it that low.  

Primary, secondary, tertiary, and "bonus" skill?;-) No, not really!  I don't
know what I would call the last level- I think quadrary skills might be too
awkward!  I am using "support skills" to indicate skills that are distinctly linked to  a specific primary or group of primaries.

Okay so:
NAME		CHANCE PER RANK		SPD BONUS	DAM BONUS
Primary			10%		SPD = RANK-2	DAM = RANK-2
Secondary		 5%		SPD/2		DAM/2
Tertiary 		 3%		SPD/4		DAM/4
Quadrary		 1%		SPD/8		DAM/8

Support skills - they act as one of the three secondary

What do you think about it.


			Alex
From: uunet!juliet.ll.mit.edu!alexj

I do not actually intend to have each Genreal skill that developed.

I think every Genrela SKill will have a list of things that it will 
aid as a tertiary(secondary?- too gross?) and that is it.

Like your list for Italian fencing(which I would change thus:)

Sword
  Lunge
  Parry
  Disarm
  Feint
  Retreat
  Press
  Called Shot: Small
Lore

General skills will NO longer be activated by roll.  No chance for 
criticals.  

			Ack!  BAck to work!
				Alex
From: uunet!juliet.ll.mit.edu!alexj

Only skills that are primaries should be put in a general skill.

Because support skills are modifiers of a primary skill.  
I think all General skills should include a :

Appropriate Lore skill
Appropriate Perception skill
+ 5 or so Primary skills that make the pattern

What do you guys think?

			Alex
From: uunet!juliet.ll.mit.edu!alexj

It takes 4 counts or 8 SPD points to make a combat perception.  
It lasts for [DRV + (RANK in appropriate perception)] counts.
During that time you may make perception rolls as a full primary
at every reaction at no speed penalties.  Or you can make specific
perception rolls at 4 counts and have double your chance.  

If you have not taken the time to fully activate your perception a 
passive perception roll is allowed at reactions at half the normal 
value.  

Here are the levels of success:
Crit Failure	- Beats you, you dope.
Failure 	- Know that a strike is occuring.
Partial Success -  Either know +- 30% when it is going to hit(in ten count 
	action +-3 counts; in 5 count action +-2 counts); OR know
	high/low/middle strike location; OR know if going to hit or miss
Full Success	- Know +- 20% when it is going to hit OR know general location
	(left arm/head/chest, etc.) OR know whether a swing is going to 
	miss_by_a_lot, miss, hit, or hit well.
Crit1		- Know +-10% when OR know specific location OR know if it is 
	going to crit/crit miss or not.
CRIT 2- more success levels to get all the stuff.  

Player chooses how to apply the success levels- a Crit1 can allow a player 
	to know the partial success info on all three types of info
	(location, timing, and efficacy of the blow).

Time mods to perception rolls(the character gets the most efficient time for
him- if he/she does a 4 count perception tyhe timing is considered from 
the last count!  If it is a passive perception it is considered from the
count before the passive perception...

1 count before action starts: 	-50 to perception
1st count of action:		-25 to perception
2nd count of action:		+00 to perception
3rd count of action:		+25 to perception 
4th count of action		+50 to perception
5th count of action		+75 to perception

Surprise results from a critical failure on a perception roll; or two 
failures in a row on the same action; or a GM call that the person wasn't
even expecting that kind of event(i.e. a sentry not expecrting trouble 
might be surprised on a single failure when grabbed from behind...)



There you go.....

From: uunet!juliet.ll.mit.edu!alexj


Okay some things:  A passive perception takes no time- it occurs on reaction,
and you can use the info in choosing the action...  One can also make 
specific rolls at 4 counts per and double the chance!  


>    Defense:  Question-- if I am undefending, and someone takes a shot at me,
>and I perform an applied defense, do they still get the +40 for undefending?
>If I activate my normal defense? (while they are swinging)

You automatically activate your defense when you perform an applied defense.
Otherwise you might be better off just activating your defense instead of applying it!  If you had it unactivated, it will unactivate again at the end 
of the applied defense.

>    It seems to me that <bias warning- we're talking Chuck here :-)> it will
>always be easier to hit someone than it will be to avoid a hit. 

	Yes.  The system is designed in such a way that if no active 
defensive measures are taken the aggressor will win.  However, imagine 
two people fighting. Both have 14s in their stats.  They will both have 20 PCFs and no other level factors(just for ease of calculation), both will
have a base defense of 18(I am going to say the Karate does NOT add to 
defense).  Both will have a base speed of 7.  THB for each will be +8. 
One has a RNK 8 in KArate, a RANK 8 in punch, and RANK 8s in two secondaries.
The other has a RANK 8 in Aikido, and RANK 8 in Defense with two secondaries 
at RANK 8.

This means:
Punch = 80(primary) + 20(pcf) +10(mod) + 8(to-hit-bonus) + 46(secondaries) +
	24(Karate) 	= 180% with a speed of 16

Aikidoka can use aikido to add to defense and defense so has base defense 
		of 18 + 8 + 24 = 50
Defense=80(prim) + 20(pcf) + 46(second) + 24(AIkido)= 170% with a speed of 16


It costs 20 speed points to make a punch a one count deal.  To defens against
that  a defense would have to be a two count action.  (defense begins halfway
through technique- at one count a two ocunt defense would start working and ties go to defender).  It costs ten speed points to reduce a defense to a 
2 count action.  

So on average initiative rolls:
(if perfroming pre-sets) is 4.5.  So both roll a 5. 
Both have a negative 11 inititiative.   The Karateka takes those 11 and needs
to generate 9 more to make a one count punch.  That is a -45.  So his chance
drops to 135%.  The Aikidoka uses 10 of his 11 and puts the last speed
point into increasing his chance by 2%!;-) giving him a 182%.

They both roll average- 50.  The AIkido ka has a complete success.  His 
defense is now 100%.  The Karateka rollsa 50 and his chance is 135% -100%
= 35%.  The Karateka misses.  Ther eis a 9% chance ther Karateka will 
critical on the  AIkidoka and a 15% chance that he will critical miss.
In this case the contest goes to the AIkidoka, except of course that
the Karateka will eventually wear him down if he takes no preemptive action.

I think the problem with the system lies in that a good martial artist will
destroy anyone who is a little lower than them at the breakpoint where a lot 
of negative initiative starts racking up.
That breakpoint appears to be around an 12 to 14 SPD.  At that point martial
art strikes can be dropped into the 2 count range- and that starts getting 
to the edge of the system.  One thing that couold control tha  alittle is make speed of action more absolute- charge 10% per speed point instead of 5%.

What do you guys think?

				Alex

From: uunet!umassmed!glhodge (Geoffrey L. Hodge)

	I only had time to skim through all the letters you guys have written,
but I have some gut reactions.  First, Alex, how about "quaternary" instead
of "quadrary?"  Second, I think that the skill structure you outlined, and 
the % chances they add looks good, but I don't know if you want to start 
adding speed and damage/effect bonuses in.  I thought of doing that for class
and area skills, and decided that we would spend half of every run just
calculating the effects of secondary skills.  Yech.  I agree that it would
be more realistic, but I'm not sure the complexity is worth the gain in
realism.
	Glad to hear that general skills will not be rolled against any more.
	I think you might be well off to set down some numbers now.  You have
already said (I think this is right) that any primary skill can have one
general skill, two secondaries and two tertiaries backing it up.  If you
adopt this new skill structure, you'll want to have a number (probably two)
of quaternaries [ :-) ] as well.  Now I think you should decide how powerful
you want general skills to be.  Then set a maximum number of skills that
each general skill can support.  That will help give martial arts styles 
their own unique flavor, and prevent general skills like "nursing" from
popping up again.  I'd vote for 5.  I know you guys might think that's a
bit low, but I'd rather not see general skills become too powerful.  Are 
they still going to add 3%/rank?  Will they also add 1%/rank to other skills?
Will they ever add 5%/rank?  (I hope not).
	Mark:  I'd like to see all MA styles add to base defense as tertiaries
(1% per rank), and some of them add 3% to "applied" defense, and others only
1% per rank.  Depends upon whether or not a style adds to one pool of skills
at 3% and another pool at 1%.  This could be a nice method for distinguishing
between the central skills of the style, and the other skills that the style
teaches.  An aikidoka would get the 3%, but a shotokan person would only get
1% (and maybe also a 1% or even 3% to a "fight from retreat" skill).

	Whew!  That was from skimming the letters.  I haven't even looked
at the combat perception stuff yet!

>I think there are a couple of fallacies in your argument--

Oh come on- that's ridiculous!  How could that be? ;-) 

>1)  If the kareteka does not activate his defense, he is at a +40.

True- I assume that most people keep their defense activated.  It is
not required though.  It would be good in a test of all-out defense vs.
all-out offense.  But then the aikidoka would retreat and evade and...;-)

>  The thrust of my initial comments was not really to compare defense 
>vs offense, but a HARD defense (block) vs an applied defense.

Hmmmm..... 
BLOCK(with HAND)
WSD:	2 counts
MOD:	+10

If the BLOCK is successful the DAMAGE of your BLOCK (same as PUNCH DAMAGE
but using the BLOCK DAMAGE PER RANK mods with PUNCH MODS as Secondary-NEW 
RULE) is subtracted from the DAMAGE of the strike.  Your arm then takes
any leftover damage(minus armor absorption and PAB of course!)

It is probably more effective than a defense- it is also higher committment
and risks damaging you.  There is no doubt in my mind that a Hammerfist
Block is a more direct and easier way to stop an incoming attack.
But i think that is realistic!  Don't you guys? 

How about this nomenclature:

General skills		3% per rank	used against primary skills
	SPD/DAM:  (RANK - 2)/2
	Limit: one per primary
*** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** ***
Support skill		5% per rank	used for support skills specific to 
	SPD/DAM:  (RANK - 2)/2		weapon(called shots, quickstrikes, 
	Limit: one per primary		etc.); or for some general skills
*** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** ***
Secondary skill		3% per rank	used for related skills or secondary
	SPD/DAM: (RANK - 2)/4		support skills
	Limit: two per primary

Tertiary skill		1% per rank	used for skills that are related

Even better:
Taking level factors into account(that is what they are there for!  )
Every skill donates a point per rank after rank 4- so lets cut it down by 
1% on every scale- except for tertiaries becaus ethey are already 
1% and except for general skills.  As for how many a General can directly 
effect- I vote 5 + Lore + Appropriate Perception.  Any othe rskill
that is generaly related it can effect as a tertiary!  It might apply
as a secondary but probably not!

This is really tough- I have been getting lazy about carefully doing 
numbers out and maintaining the  fucking context I have so carefully 
controlled thus far- these numbers reflect that better.  A first level 
spy character can still pump out an 125% base chance on a skill(discounting
level factor, to-hit bonus, and mods which could pump the specialist up to
THB +16; LVF 21;MOD(if easy skill like punch) +10 so... 172% chance is 
possible if the character puts two 18s in the right spot(for both THB and 
the appropriate LVF) uses an easy skill, and dedicates all his skills to the 
right set of interconnecting skills, including a specific support skill,
a general skill, and two very related skills, and two pretty related skills.
THat has a 5 in everything and a 6 in the primary.  Total cost: 44 points
in ISL points, and all your stat points into those two stats.

BTW Jim- I didn't get a chance to acknowledge how great I think Space 
Hybrid is coming.  It is REALLY REALLY showing the tons and tons of work
that you have put into it!  I was very impressed by what I saw.   

It bothered me because it reminded me of how little I have been working
on BT!  I hate the thought that I am now behind you in compilation and 
formulation.  Pretty childish, huh?;-)  Great work!  It is turning into a 
masterpiece!

ON REACTION SPEED:
These are my not so humble opinions:

I think reaction speed can(for gaming purposes) be realistically said to
be generated in this way:

1) data comes in through the perceptions, no reaction to anything can occur
until a perception roll of somekind is made, or it is not a REaction but
an initiation.... as soon as the perception roll is made, then the time
of reaction begins....Steps 2 and 3 are what I call reaction speed.

2) the data is interpreted, and put into a framework the mind can understand

3) the mind makes a decision to act based on the interpreted data

4) the mind commands the body to go and the action speed of the decided
action kicks in...

Native Reaction Speed(NRS) is your mind's ability to process data and
	tell your muscles or whatever  to perform a set task.
	It is based on your  stats.  I think this can be improved but
	I am not certain...

Skill-based Reaction Speed(SRS) is based on being so familiar with a set
	of skills and tasks that they can be mor equickly accessed and
	initiated quicker.  THis is hard to study because ther eis the
	question of muscle memory and how much "faster Actions" are based 
	on the bodies training in the use of those systems(thus they are 
	built up, etc.) and how much is in the nervous system. I think
	both are important(maybe only half the speed bonus can go to 
	initiative and at least half must go to speeding the action up,
	or improving the chance?  )  


Surprised: 
	Neither has much bearing except...your native speed includes
your mental agility.  I honestly think some people have higher processing 
speeds.  I think surprise is a situation whereafter the reaction speed 
is an indictaion of how fast the mind can do step 2.  I think this is 
included in native reaction speed(NRS).  For that reason I think NRS
does have a bearing.  I think the skill filter does not- because at this
point the mind has no reason to be thinking in terms of the skill.  However
at step 3 the skill template comes up quicker than if you have to think the 
whole process through and you react to the stimuli as you have been trained.
Thus the answer:  Both effect it!  I think NRS has mor eof an impact
in surpirse situations but SRS is still significant.
IN SUMMARY: NSR contributes significantly more than SRS

Unengaged:
	NSR is still a little more important, but certainly less than from 
surprise!  SRS becomes important when you make the decision once more.
ANd you are also more "used to" inteprreting offensive movements if you are a 
martial artist and thus may process the data mor equickly but I honestly
think that is a PERCEPTION question and not a SPEED question. 
IN SUMMARY: NRS contributes a little more than SRS

Engaged:
	Here the template is up and running and ready to be applied.  The
perceptions are also cued to recieve those specific stinmuli and push them
through quickly(based on the skill the person has in that field)
A slow person can be absurdly fast when doing somehting they have mastery in.
IN SUMMARY: SRS contributes more than NRS.  

Preset:
	In this case reaction speed isn't even an issue- it is how fast 
the mind can execute the chain of actions.  How often the person has 
consciously done that chain of actions(i.e skill level and training) is
going to be the main quetsion,  In this case SRS is much more important.
IN SUMMARY: SRS contributes a lot more, NRS contributes a little.

My 2 cents!

Return-Path: <glhodge@umassmed.UMMED.EDU>

Mark & Alex, (not discussion related):  I saw a couple of Mercedes coupes
yesterday.  I knew they were bigger than the tiny cars (like Triumphs & MGs)
but I didn't realize how much bigger.  Still definately smaller than a 
Mustang.  They have a back seat.  That means, a place to put your butt.
Leg room is optional.

Quaternary not only sounds more correct to me, but more natural as well.
Maybe that is because being correct comes so naturally to me ;-)
I'd guess that it sounds more natural to Jim, too, he being a chemist and
all...

Block vs. Defense:  I am glad to see that blocking is superior to defense.
I believe that is how it works in a real fight.  If I am correct about what
Alex means by "defense," it is an evasive action performed *without*
retreating.  If that is true, blocks are much much more common in any
fighting styles I've seen (including Aikido, which usually combines the
two, using them roughly equally).

I do think, however, that one of the most common defensive moves is hardly
every used in RPGs.  Both BT and Taliesin (and probably SH as well) have
options for retreating, but nobody ever uses it.  I think that a quick
retreat, followed by closing back into combat range, is an extremely common
combat technique (comparable to blocking, and used much more often that
defense).  I'd like to see an easy system to encourage people to use this
option more in place of defense, but I'm not sure how to go about it.  (I'm
supposed to be working on my magic system :-)

Alex, I also think your format for blocking is unrealistic, although the
realism may not be worth the trouble.  The idea of rolling damage for a
block, and subtracting that from the attack is interesting, but doesn't
take into account the fact that attack forms will be different.  The system
works well if the attack is a swinging attack (like a shuto (sp?)), but
a linear attack like a punch requires much less force to divert than a
swinging attack would.  Is this actually a parry?

Here is what I have been thinking about for Taliesin:  Parrys turn the 
attack aside.  Each level of success cuts either the damage or the opponent's
chance to hit (which do you guys think?) in half, cumulatively.  Blocks,
if successful, completely stop the attack, but the blocking surface takes
full damage (possibly reduced by levels of effect).  The big difference would
be that blocking allows the defender to ignore the "parry mod" of the weapon.
That will encourage people to block with heavy weapons rather than trying to
parry with them (which I think is more realistic).  I am also thinking of
having blocks be more effective for circular attacks (usually CH, CR or SL),
and parries be more effective for linear attacks (usually P).  What do you
think of this idea?

I guess I'd better end this letter, and say the rest in another one--otherwise
nobody will read through the whole thing...

<Don't know if this will make it to Jim-- Pls fwd>
 
I can pretty much see your definitions.  I would disagree that 
native speed has no effect in a surpise situation.    If your 
speed has any mental factors in it, those factors, at least, should 
modify your initiative.  I'm also not sure that physical and skill 
factors are not a factor even in a surprise situation.  What is your 
reaction if someone throws, out of the blue, a punch at you?  I'll 
give you 10 to 1 you'll block it.
 
The whole thing, while accurate, seems a little finely grained.  
Also, it seems to only cover _reactions_.  How do actions work??

From: uunet!juliet.ll.mit.edu!alexj

What do you think of requiring that at least half of the rank bonus go to
action speed.  That would slow down the drastic effect of RANK benefits 
without actually losing.  Then RANK would speed up the reaction and the 
action itself- might be more realistic!  Thoughts?

Jeff - I am still pondering your posts!  I will get back to you!

ON RECOVERY

I absolutely think ther eis recovery.  I am looking at half-weapon speed
as the recovery.  I think the recovery does not require an initiative roll
and begins immediately after(why?  Game mechanics - if we roll init for
recoveries we will be there all day.  Recovery will be based on the weapon 
speedof the weapon not on the speed of the strike!  With one exception:The force of the strike is modeleled by the base dmaage of the weapon, so
if one quickstrikes by reducing damage then the recovery will be that much 
faster, if one great blows and adds damage then the recovery will be 
that much slower!

Any action that FINISHES while recovering from another action will take -20.

ON KATA/TASKS/FLORENTINE

I think florentine is strictly the use of mulptiple actions simultaniously
It hink what I have been calling a Kata is just a skill in doing a series
of actions in sequence, and doing them quickly(or at least efficiently).
I am changing the name form Kata to Tasks or something like that.  
Kata, as we know them from martial arts are a method to teach sets of tasks 
to people.  You learn certain combinations of tasks within the Kata and 
these combinations are what you actually gain skill in through the kata.
That is why it is so feasible to take a piece out of a Kata and execute it.
It think the generic TASKS skillwe  will have to have rules as to how many 
actions can be included in a TASK and how specific the actions have to be.
Thw MG-MG-Rapier would be a task.  What do you think?

	I guess that requiring half a skill's speed points be used toward
reducing the action speed would be more realistic, but it would be more
complicated too.  I think that would be a reasonable change.  If you do
decide to go that route though, what do you think about giving characters
rank # of speed points (instead of Rank-2)?  It is a little less confusing
(it would help to balance out the splitting of points) and the extra 2 speed
points probably wouldn't be felt as much if half are required to go into 
action speed.

	I agree that there is absolutely a recovery time.  Maybe I didn't 
explain things well enough.  The way I have weapons listed currently, the
weapon speed includes the recovery time.  That is why you may use half your
weapon speed when you are "en garde."  What I am thinking of doing is not
really adding a recovery time, but instead just changing the way weapon 
speeds are listed on the Weapon Table.  It used to be safe to assume that
in combat a character would typically use the same weapon and attack form
over and over again.  Those days are long past now.  I was just talking about
presenting the info in a more concise fashion.
	I like the idea that quick strikes have faster recoveries and great
blows have longer recoveries.  As to the -20% to any action which is completed
while another is recovering (I am reading that correctly, right?)--I don't
know if that is necessary.  I am not going to penalize people for recovering
because I think that it is a relatively natural action, and requires little
thought.  Do you think that keeping track of the recovery times of various
weapons is going to get a bit hairy?  I think it will add to the flavor of
combat enough that I am willing to do it anyway.

	I have no idea what you were saying about kata and florentine! :-)
Please try to re-explain your ideas.  I see florentine as a skill which
allows a person to fight with two weapons completely independently of each-
other--almost as if two different people were wielding the weapons (except
that the tactics will be better coordinated).  I have expanded the martial
arts term "kata" to mean any set of specific actions practiced in a specific
order.  In Taliesin, a kata is basically like a quick strike skill for a
series of actions.  The more actions you have, the smaller a bonus you get.
Obviously, the more ranks you have, the higher a bonus you get.  To apply
the kata bonus, the action performed must be preceeded by the action which
preceeds it in the kata.  This requires people to "get into" their kata by
executing the first move without the kata bonus.  They can pick up the kata
at any point, and if they know several kata with the same moves, they can
jump from kata to kata at the shared moves.  I think this is a fairly realistic
model for allowing people the benefit of practicing a particular series of
actions, restricting them to the patterns they practiced, but allow them to
have some practical application to a real combat.
	The concept I was trying to explain is far less specific than a kata,
but considerably easier to learn than florentine fighting (as we have defined
it).  It is practicing with two (or more) weapons to increase the speed and
coordination of use (like florentine), but the particular weapons are used in
a specific order, over and over again.  The idea being that it is much easier
to learn to use weapons in a particular pattern than to have them act
independently.

Here's #2.

I talked a bit with Mark (live) yesterday, and came to some conclusions about
General skills and forms.  First, I think the limit should be 5 primary skills
*including* lore and perception.  Remember, not all gen skills will be MA forms
so they will not all need lores and perceptions.  Also, as Mark pointed out,
the primary skills for most Martial Arts will be Punch (hand), Kick (foot),
Combat Per, and maybe Defense.  Everything else is a support skill.  I also
think, btw, that it is very possible to become very good at one style without
building up much lore.

IMO, most styles will be defined by their support skills--not their primaries.
(Excepion being hard vs soft styles).  I'd like to see forms add 3% to 5
or maybe up to 8 skills--primary or support.  In the case of support skills,
one rank in the form would actually add an extra rank to the secondary skill.
(Instead of adding 3% to the "block" skill, which would get lost since "block"
only adds 3% per RANK, the form would add 3% to the _chance to block_, and
1/2 a point of speed, or whatever).  I like this idea because a limit of 5-8
skills will define a style, and it allows support skills to be influenced by
the form.  What do you think?

Jim:  I roughly agree with your current view, (and Alex's breakdown of
reactions), except that I am not sure there is a difference between engaged
and unengaged.  Presets help to cancel out thinking, which means NRS doesn't
count for much.  Surprise requires one to figure out what is going on before
one can react.  Here, NRS (which I assume is the mental processing time) is
very important.  In both engaged and unengaged situations, the person is
neither surprised or has a preset.  I think both reaction speeds weigh roughly
equally.  The only difference between engaged and unengaged is a matter of
perception rolls.

Speaking of perception rolls, Alex, what does Combat Perception do for you?
I mean really?  I assume that I need to see an attack to block it.  How
much do I need to know about the attack's timing and location?  When do I
start getting plusses?  What do I get plusses to (defense, block, applied
defense, parry, etc) and do the mods differ depending upon the skill they
modify?  Also, what does a feint do for you?  I think they may be too gross,
but I don't know the numbers well enough yet.  I'm having a tough time 
deciding what to do with Combat Perc in Taliesin.  You all know that I think
it is one of the most important skills used in a fight, but I'm not sure 
how to model the fact that it works constantly and passively, but that some
times you are all over an attack, and sometime it catches you by surprise.
I don't want to have people make multiple rolls per attack (I had decided
to give a +10% per segment after 1), but that doesn't model reality that
well.  Sigh.

Finally, I have been thinking about martial arts and hand techniques.  I
would currently run two handed martial arts combats as a florentine action,
or as two weapons reacting independently (but one at a time).  I have done
some thinking about this, since I knew neither was a good model, and thought
of a couple things.  The weapon speeds I have listed are the speed to attack
and recover the weapon to a "ready" position.  That is why you can cut your
weapon speed in half if you are waiting for a chance to attack.  I have toyed
with the idea of splitting these in half and having the attacks go in three
phases:  reaction, action, and recovery (which I believe is what Alex has
decided to do).  This is pretty much how I ran things anyway.  It is just that
it hardly ever comes into play.  I am beginning to think that there is more
to is than that, though.

I think there may be a technique halfway between a kata and florentine.  In
a kata, you learn specific moves in a specific pattern.  In florentine fighting
both hands work completely independently.  I think that many martial arts
teach a specific pattern (left-right-left-right), that is not as specific as
a kata, but more restrictive than a florentine.  This system might not be 
worth modeling for martial arts because cutting out the reaction time will
always make it more desirable to act with the "fresh" hand.  In a situation
where the weapons are of uneven speed, however, I think it could come into
play.  Say I have a rapier and a main gauche.  If P
If I practice a pattern of actions, Main gauche, main gauche, rapier, I
should get quicker at that pattern (like a florentine or kata).  I could
parry/block or attack during any one of the actions, but breaking the
MG-MG-Rapier pattern would break the "semi-florentine."  I'm not sure it is
worth modeling, and I'm just throwing it out as a thought.  What do you
think?

Jesus!  Don't you guys work anymore!!

I just got swamped with mail!
Well, here's my 6 cents worth.  WARNING:  I'm not a GM and therefore I 
tend toward the simplistic / ease of play concepts.

ON KATA:
I always pictured ranks in a skill, particularly weapons, as learning 
hoiw best to use the individual movements with the weapon.  Kata in 
martial arts are studied ways of performing the movements but don't
all weapon skills have built in sequences?  As a players goes up in a
skill he learns how to put the movements together.  I think that the whole
concept of kata should be worked into the weapon speed.  The higher the
skill the faster it becomes, right?  Although, you can learn to physically
move a sword (or hand) faster I think the majority of the increased speed
associated with level comes from the characters knowledge of how the
sequence one action into another with minimal recovery time.

ON LORES:
I think Alex overkills on the lore concept.  If lore equates to history 
and it seems to then I think it is perfectly feasible for a character to
know how to perform a skill without knowing where it comes from or how it
was developed.  The martial arts push lore as part of the class but I think
it is more a teaching style than a requirement.

From: uunet!umassmed.UMMED.EDU!glhodge (Geoffrey L. Hodge)

	On kata:  I just re-read your paragraph about kata.  I don't think
that the best way to model a kata is by breaking it down into "tasks."  To
do that, you would have to break each kata down into every set of sequential
actions from 2 to the number in the kata.  I think what a kata teaches you
is how to move from one specific action, quickly and accurately to another
specific one.  Any time those two (or more) actions are used sequentially,
the kata training will help make that transition quicker and more accurate.

							-Jeff

From: uunet!umassmed.UMMED.EDU!glhodge (Geoffrey L. Hodge)

	Alex, were you in debater mode, on cheap drugs, or really tired when
you responded to my last letter?  You wrote several pages in response to the
several pages I wrote, but I don't think you directly addressed a single thing
I brought up!  :-)

	I suggested you drop the Rank-2 speed pts. formula for skills, and
let skills give the character a number of speed points equal to their rank
instead.  To this, you responded that they were "actually getting rank" 
in speed points, you just set zero skill at a -2.  Hmmm.  Do you really see
that as different?  Just curious. ;-)  Let me rephrase my request.  Perhaps,
in light of the changes involving splitting speed points up between action
and reaction times, you could afford to drop the -2 at rank 0.

	Yes, I was talking about listing weapons on the Weapon Table without
the reaction time included.  I think I will steal your modification of having
the recovery time be proportional to the time of the strike (quick strike
and great blow), although the recovery time in Taliesin will remain equal to
the strike time (rather than 1/2 as you proposed for BT).  I do not intend to
require people to react before recovering their weapon--it will start auto-
matically as soon as the blow is finished.  Blocks, parries, and critical
misses will (as they always have) increase recovery time.  Am I right in
thinking that you will require people to react before covering weapons, but
that it happens as a "free action" (like activating defense) whenever the next
reaction occurs?  Can people preset weapon recoveries?  Would anyone not do
that?

	Yes, as you suspected, I was completely and utterly confused by Edgar
the swordsman.  What the hell were you saying?  :-)

	On kata:  I think the level of specificity (type of attact/defense,
support skills used, and high/middle/low) is very reasonable.  I don't really
see the reason for splitting kata up into "tasks."  You would have to generate
such a huge number of tasks that they would never be recorded on paper
individually.  I think they would just become extra conceptual baggage on what
is already a marathon Bardic Tales journey.

	The press/retreat ideas you have will, IMO, work well for you and BT.
I am hoping to come up with something more streamlined yet still useful for
Taliesin.  No brainstorms yet.

	I think a mixed parry & block system might work well with BT.  If you
are right that it would be "extrordinarily complicated," it might not be worth
while, but if you can come up with a system that is merely "very complicated"
and could be ignored by people who didn't care about it, that might be worth-
while.  I don't remember if I included this in my last letter, but I will
probably make block & parry the same skill in Taliesin.  They both have to do
with predicting the path of the incoming blow, and meeting it at a particular
angle with your own weapon.  The player will chose which technique to use.
The difference will be that blocks stop all damage (it is taken by the blocking
surface) and parries reduce the opponent's chance to hit (or maybe damage).
Blocking will not be modified by parry mods, so heavy weapons will be better
suited to blocking.  What do you think?

	I guess I'll end here.  I want to discuss general skills, but I think
that will be a letter by itself.

							-Jeff

From: uunet!umassmed.UMMED.EDU!glhodge (Geoffrey L. Hodge)

	Okay, here we go.  Alex, you didn't really respond to my suggestion
about how to run general skills.  Did you see & understand it?  The basic
idea was to say that a general skill could enhance 5-8 skills at 3% per rank.
Both primary and support skills would be enhanced by the general skill.  A
support skill like "block" would not have 3% added to the block skill, but
would instead have 3% added to the chance to block.  Anything not covered in
the list of 5-8 skills would not get a 3% per rank bonus.

	You listed several martial arts and the skills that were associated
with them.  I think, first of all, that you included many more very specific
skills in the martial arts (esp. Shotokan) that you know well, but generalized
more on the others.  I also think that you included many skills that are
taught by the style, but do not "define" it.  Sure, Shotokan uses quick strikes
and called shot locations, but does that set it apart from other styles?  Are
they the main focus of the style?  What martial art teaches its students to 
strike slowly at random areas??  (Tai Chi maybe :-)  Do you really think that
Shotokan puts as much emphasis on kicking as Tae Kwon Do?  Then how come you
listed that many kicking skills?

	The point is this:  Almost all martial arts will teach punch, kick,
block, combat perception, quick strike, called shot, defense, press, retreat,
great blow, etc, etc, at least to some degree.  What I am suggesting is thta
you decide which 5-8 skills are the backbone of the style.  They alone would
get the 3%/rank from the general skill: style.  Other skills taught by the
skill would get 1% per rank.  I think you should be able to define most styles
with 8 skills.  It won't cover everything you learn in that style, but it is
not supposed to.  Here is what I would recommend (although I am drawing this
only from descriptions & small familiarity with the styles):

Shotokan:

Shotokan:		Aikido:		Tae Kwon Do:
Combat Percepiton	Comb. Per.	Comb. Per.
Punch			Defense		Jump
Block			Block (bnp)	Block (but not punch)
Great Blow (hand)	Grapple Hold	Spin
Lunge			Throw		Kick
Fight from Retreat	Nerve/Joint 	Quick Strike Kick (maybe)
			   Techniques
			Breakfall

	I think that Aikido and TKD emphasize blocking, but do not emphasize
punching.  I gave TKD a quick strike kick because, although all martial arts
encourage speed, TKD seems to be more concerned with speed of kicks than most
(because that is a main form of attack).  That may or may not be valid.  The
weakness of a kick is that it is slow, and TKD offsets this by teaching speed
just as Shotokan offsets the weakness of punches (they are not as strong as
kicks) by teaching great blow (and lunge).  A Kung-Fu style would improve
punches with quick strikes and maybe called shot & nerve techniques.  This
may not be a completely accurate portrayal of these martial arts (because I
am not that widely versed), but I think you get the idea.  I think you could
define a martial arts style fairly well with 6 skills.  Remember that they
will not be the only 6 skills the student learns--they are just the ones that
are emphasized.

	I have to agree with Britt that you are a bit percetion and lore happy.
It is certainly true that Stephen should know more about guitars than Chuck
or Borealis, but does he really need a "guitar lore" skill?  Why not let the
general skills double as lore skills if you feel that lore is so necessary?
Creating millions of tiny lore skills will make nobody happy (except you and
Stephen :-)

	Does everything have a general skill?  If you critical a skill, can
you put 1 of the 2+ EPs into the general skill?  If not, how do you establish
them?

	Once you have agreed with my ideas for general skills :-) we should
define the skill lists for some of the more commonly used ones.  I have a
G:Science skill.  Yesterday you mentioned a G:Biology skill.  What does that
make G:Science, a "really general" skill?


	About combat perception:  You wrote quite a bit, but all I really
wanted to know is how well do I have to roll vs. my combat perception to get
plusses to my applied defense/parry/block, etc.  What are the actual numbers?
How beneficial is it to roll against the Combat Percepion skill instead of
base perception?  Twice as good?

	I guess that's it for today.  Talk to you later,

ON BLOCKS/PARRIES

]Do you guys think it would be simple enough
]to generate a mixed parry/block system?  When I was workjing on it I 
]developed one that allowed you to choose whether the units of blocking 
](measured in damage- brushblocks were given a "damage number") were applied
]to to-hit of your opponent or damage.  I decided it would be too complicated.
]WHat do you guys think?

Here is my unified parry/block system:  You guys tell me if it is too much!

You roll a parry against an attack you know is coming.  Your to-hit roll 
is subtracted from by your opponents skill at their weapon * 3.  Otherwise
it is straight.  If you suceed you roll full normal damage.   IF you critical
then you figure that in.   Then you have a choice- you can either match the 
guy point for point or you can subtract -5% for every point of damage or any
combination.  

ON REACTION SPEED/ACTION SPEED SPLIT

I was thinking that half of your total SPD points that came from rank- 
including General skills, secondaries and the primary- would go to 
speeding up the action instead of subtracting form initiative.
Do you think that would be that complicated?  It is adding a divided by two 
to a process we already do... is it worth it? 

ON RANK

I did address it, Jeff! I don't think speeds need the help!
I like the -2 init at 0 rank.  I don't know does anyone think we would 
need more speed points?

Jeff says:
>(Instead of adding 3% to the "block" skill, which would get lost since "block"
>only adds 3% per RANK, the form would add 3% to the _chance to block_, and
>1/2 a point of speed, or whatever).  

	I like the idea-but my original conception was to not have support 
skills be included  in the limit- only primaries.  More on that later!

ON KATA

Jeff says:
>  To do that, you would have to break each kata down into every set of 
>sequential actions from 2 to the number in the kata.  I think what a kata 
>teaches you is how to move from one specific action, quickly and accurately
>to another specific one. 

I agree - how else would you run a Kata?  You will always have a list of 
actions in sequence.  How can you avoid that?

Jeff says:
>To this, you responded that they were "actually getting rank" 
>in speed points, you just set zero skill at a -2.  Hmmm.  Do you really see
>that as different?  Just curious. ;-)

	I got it!  But they rae different- what I am trying to be careful of
is losing the speed scale the system is built on.  Right now a person with
a one skill is 1 count slower than their speed.  IF we give straight rank 
then that perosn is one count faster than their speed.  Remeber the change
isn't really going to reflect as much of a loss of speed- more of it will 
just come out of the action!  I am leary(leery?) of giving away more speed!

Jim says:
>I am afraid I have to disagree with the idea that the pluses for kata
>start in and gradually increase.

It isn't clear to me that that is what Jeff had in mind.  The way i 
interpreted it is that once you have the Kata going it is going full steam-
i.e. you get full bonuses(whatever they are) - you just don't get any
bonuses until you do one action of the kata because the skill is a 
"transition skill between specific actions".  I like that!  

DO you guys think Kata's give bonuses to the chances involved with any of 
the skills as they do in my system now.  I am thinking maybe it should just
be a tertiary(1% per rank) and give RANK to the INIT(or half to INIT and half 
to action speed) roll inbetween the actions- I am almost convinced!

ON RECOVERY

>although the recovery time in Taliesin will remain equal to
>the strike time (rather than 1/2 as you proposed for BT).

Do you think it takes a slong to recover as it does to strike in real life? 
 I am not at all convinced of that.  It appears to me to be significantly faster to pull back an attack than to launch it- unless the attack was high
committment.  But that is handled in lunge rules.  Jim, Mark- how long
do you guys think recovery takes compared to strike speed?

Jeff says:
> I do not intend to require people to react before recovering their weapon
>--it will start automatically as soon as the blow is finished. 

	Hmm.  Me neither.  It will run as a background action.  And this gets back to Edgar too...;-)  I propose that a person only rolls one reaction roll.
He uses that number he rolled, say a 7 and a 4{11},  and uses it for his
inti for his next action.  He also uses the "7"(because he rolle dit forst say,
or it was the blue d8, or whatever distinguishing mechanism) as his pre-set init for his reocvery- to which he can apply his weapon skill and it takes 
1/2 WSD to complete.  ANd it goes on WHILE he is reacting and acting on that 
init roll.  I think that MIGHT be more realistic.  I was thinking that 
florentine might be more REALISTICALLY done that way as well- one roll 
spurring two actions.  
	Just a thought!


ON LORES

Britt says(and Jeff similarly before him):

>I think Alex overkills on the lore concept. 

HUMPH!  

>If lore equates to history 
>and it seems to then I think it is perfectly feasible for a character to
>know how to perform a skill without knowing where it comes from or how it
>was developed.  

	Lore is not quite history.  In any skill you pick up a body of 
knowledge that goes along with it.  You learn how you address a master 
mechanic, you learn slang words for various auto-parts, you learn the names
of big auto supply stores- whatever- there is knowledge that goes with
every skill.  IN most cases I am happy enough to have the skill contribute 
that.  If you take auto-repair- you don't have to know that stuff- you could 
have learned at home on your own car.  Hoever- when you are talking about
GENERAL skills it is a little different.  You are tlaking about a set of skills
ties together by some common theme.  Now- I absolutely agree that some guy
could stand on a mountian by himself and develop a style of martial arts 
by fighting every day.  He could have a genral skill and no lore.  

Lore does not technically belong in general skills.  I added it because most 
of the ones I thought of had it.   I withdraw the requirement for both
Lore and Perception(same reasons).  I just think they are in most.  I do think
that the three examples all include lore skills- Tae-Kwon-Do, AIkido, Shotokan,
and Fencing all have Lores associate with them!  Oh never mind!  I hate being
wrong! ;-)  

>I think, first of all, that you included many more very specific
>skills in the martial arts (esp. Shotokan) that you know well, but generalized
>more on the others. 

	Very true- the curse of all game design!  


>I also think that you included many skills that are
>taught by the style, but do not "define" it. 

	I don't think you undesrstood what I was trying to describe in
those lists!  Read on-

> Sure, Shotokan uses quick strikes
>and called shot locations, but does that set it apart from other styles?  Are
>they the main focus of the style?  What martial art teaches its students to 
>strike slowly at random areas??  

	Actually you would be surprised- Shotokan emphasizes called shots
more than any system I have ever studied(with the exception of the sub-form
of SNAKE in KUng-Fu).  SHotokan does not quick strike especially- but I did not
put that as a skill in SHotokan.  I put Instant Attack in SHotokan- which it
does emphasize mor ethan other styles.  That is to attack without reacting.
ALso to clear something up- I wrote the support skills in as limitations, not 
as benefits.  Right now- only Primary skills are covered in my General Skills.
The General skill would only be a tertiary if the person were not using those
techniques.  To be more correct- In Tae-Kwon_DO is should have put ALL as one of the catagories so that it was clear that Tae-Kwon-Do gets the bonus for all foot techniques- Shotokan does NOT get the "all" in any techniques- it teaches 
a very limited set of attacks!

Tae-kwon-DO does not use called shots in general.  Students are taught to kick 
hard to general areas.  (Mind you these are all generalizations that 
differentiate the styles- in the end, a martial is a martial art is a martial 
art...).  Shotokan people are taught to hit specific nerve bundles- with every
shot! 

> Do you really think that
>Shotokan puts as much emphasis on kicking as Tae Kwon Do?  Then how come you
>listed that many kicking skills?

SO you see the Shotokan kick is severly limited(and thus distinguished from a Tae-Kwon-Do kick or Kung Fu kick) to get the bnuses you have to do a great 
blow,lunging kick to a specific location)  MAybe that is too harsh- I don't 
know.    But that is what I meant!

>	The point is this:  Almost all martial arts will teach punch, kick,
>block, combat perception, quick strike, called shot, defense, press, retreat,
>great blow, etc, etc, at least to some degree.  What I am suggesting is thta
>you decide which 5-8 skills are the backbone of the style. 

What I am suggesting is that what will distinguish styles is by forcing the 
techniques to utilize pareticular types of punches , kicks, etc.  SO
link punch to called shot, or to great blow.  Then that has a specific game 
defined meaning.  It will mean that sometimes people WON'T use their general 
skills all the time- a SHotokan person might kick off a series of low committment punches to get a person in the position they want whatever- and then hit them with a SHOTOKAN punch.  This actually seems to model my 
experience in sparring as well.

What do you guys think?

ALso - I put "Kata" in the list of things covered by the general skill. I thik the Kata would be mor elikely to be influenced by the genral skill.
ACK!  I would even replace all the Lores with Katas!  THe lores might belong in
the Shotokan fighter PACKAGE but probably not in the GENERAL skill!!!!
A kata is so influenced by the genral understanding of the style that I can't 
se eit not being covered.  I think I would allow any number of KAta to be 
contributed by the general skill.  I would even genrealize that to non-fighting kata- TASKS- a skill ofr doing groups of actions using the general 
skill would gain the bonus of the genrasl skill ayutomatically!  

SO how does 8 work for people with KATA or its like being allowed to take one 
slot for all such skills i nthe package... perception and lore would be possible but optional(as would KATA of course).  Thoughts?  

Jeff's idea about general skills influencing secondaries is neat but I would
prefer to have only the primaries be acted on if possible(keeping the skil system consistant.)

>	Does everything have a general skill?  If you critical a skill, can
>you put 1 of the 2+ EPs into the general skill?  If not, how do you establish
>them?

	I think most things have a general skill.  Yes you can generate it out 
of criticals or out of training.   I have been thinking of making it s hard as stat training(taking a cue from Jeff's more eeps for area skills) so it would
take 20 hours of trianing w/out a teacher, and two eeps to get a roll(brutal
isn't it?).  Just a thought.  ALso instead of two eeps to get a roll for stats
I have been thinking of a modified roll instead- like a -50 on the roll
or something and letting it be normal time.  That wouild have a similar effect- thoughbe devastating on nay general skills over rank 5!  (Too devastating

Didn't you get my big post on combat perception?  That details out for each levleo f success what the information you get is.  In terms of what to do 
with it the location thing is explained in that post, timing and effectiveness of opponents blow do not bestow numeric advantages ecxcept those you can 
create- you know much you can great blow without risk- you can stop defending for 4 counts, whatever....

>How beneficial is it to roll against the Combat Percepion skill instead of
>base perception?  Twice as good?

To roll against your combat perception instead of your PER allows you to
drop one level of success in your favor.  I.e. a fail becomes a partial 
success, a partial success becomes a full success, etc.   I said it was 
twice as good and it isn't quite.  This implementation is the easist though
and can be quite benficial if you look at the numbers!



Oh well.....

	I told you guys not to get me going.  I'm supposed to be working on
my magic system!  Well instead, I've been thinking a lot about the combat
system in Taliesin (and BT).  Let me run some ideas by you and see what
you think of them.

	I have included Phil in this discussion since he seems to like 
working on systems.  He even makes useful suggestions sometimes :-)

	The first change I am thinking about is the parry/block idea.
(Recap for Phil:  Block/parry becomes one skill.  Block takes all damage
to blocking surface--may need to save vs. breaking.  Parry moves damage
aside--decreases chance to hit of opponent.  Blocking not modified by
parry mod of weapon--heavy & unbalanced weapons will be better for blocking
than parrying.  Parries better at linear attacks, blocks better at arcing,
swinging attacks).

	I've been thinking about the idea of pressing.  I lifted the idea
(along with many other combat options) straight from Bardic Tales (thanks,
Alex).  Now that I think of it, though, I think fighting in a press should
not increase the chance to hit or the amount of damage.  In fact, I think
it should decrease them.  Since Taliesin has a fairly linear relationship
between %chance to hit and damage, a negative mod to %chance to hit will
decrease damage as well (on the average).  I am probably going to make 
fighting in a press take negative mods to hit.  I may just have a different
concept than Alex does of "normal" fighting ranges.  The "normal" range in
Taliesin will be that where the weapon is most effective.  I think Alex has
the normal range set at what I would call a light retreat.  I believe he is
trying to model the fact that most normal people are a bit tenative about
closing right into a slugfest (is that right, Alex?).  I would just as soon
set the normal range as the most effective, then say that any change in that
range (press or retreat) brings negative modifiers.  I think Ueichi, from
what I have heard, teaches "fight in press" skills.  Shotokan sounds like
it teaches "fight from retreat" skills.  What do you think?

	I have also been thinking about getting rid of dice in weapon 
damages.  This ties into something I have been discussing with Phil.  I 
would like to decrease the effects of a normal success in all actions, then
say that each level of success ("critical" in the old school :-) increases
effect by +1x.  It is easier to calculate 1x, 2x, 3x damage than to have to
deal with halves.  Just another attempt to streamline and make things more
playable.  Since increasing levels of effect bring varying levels of damage,
and the accuracy of the swing and the opponents ability to avoid or stop it
are all accounted for by various combat skills, why roll dice for damage?
What does it mean when a well executed sword swing does only 1 pt of damage?
Not that the opponent dodged--that would be evasion.  Not that he parried or
blocked--he would have rolled vs. the appropriate skill.  Not that it was a
poor blow--it succeeded by 20% (lets say).  Why have varying damage?

	The argument against this is 1) varying damage accounts for all the
little things like sun in your eyes, gusts of wind, etc, and 2) rolling
damage is fun.  I am also thinking of cutting the curves (the random part)
way down, and having a base amount of guarenteed damage.  What do you guys
think of that?  (I think Alex will like it since it is basically what he uses).
I would still like to retain 2 dice to keep a bell curve though.

	Is it necessary to separate grapple and overbear?  This is another
thing I lifted from BT, but am now questioning.  I definately see a difference,
but I'm not sure it is worth modeling (in Taliesin).  My idea is this:
Grappling is a skill based on dexterity and strength.  (Dexterity meaning
body-centered actions).  Currently, people overbear if they are strong, but
grapple if they are weak.  Could it be reasonably modeled that everyone 
grapples and strong people have an advantage, but that weak (and lightweight)
people can make this up through skill levels?  How about this as an
alternative:  Grapple is Dex based (maybe also Agl).  People get to modify
their grapple chance upward if they are strong or heavy, but it is not part
of the base (therefore would not be magnified with increasing ranks).  Do
either of those systems seem reasonable?  I'd like to get rid of the duplicity
in the grapple & overbear skills if possible.

	Finally, I have come up with a list (sorry, it is not arranged 
logically) of combat actions.  I would like to come up with an exhaustive
list of hand to hand techniques.  From this list, I would like to be able
to assemble any martial arts style in the known world.  (Alex & Mark--this
is what I was talking about before the run).  Please look at this list and
tell me if you can think of any techniques--unarmed only--that cannot be
explained reasonably by some combination of these skills:

	Hand (punch), foot (kick), elbow strike, knee strike, block (arm &
leg), backfist, spearhand/phoenix eye, knife/ridgehand, claw strike, palm
heel, roundhouse kick, crescent kick, axe kick, front (snap or thrust) kick,
side/back kick, hook/slap kick, head butt, bite, body slam, hold, throw,
release, sweep.    [These are the basic skills.  Most will be supports to
"hand" or "foot."  What follows are the skills that modify how the technique
is done in combat.]

	Spin, jump, feint, quickstrike, greatblow, lunge, press, retreat,
joint locks, nerve strikes, (combat anatomy???), snap*  [snap is an attempt
to model the effects of rotating hips/shoulders during an attack.  It would
account for the extra power of a (shotokan?) punch or a rear-leg kick].

	This represents a complete list of all the skills I could come up
with from GURPS Martial Arts, Palladium's Superspies and Ninja book, all our
discussion about martial arts, and even a bit of real reading.  I have not
included acrobatics or staples of combat like perception and evasion.  Can
you guys think of anything I have missed or failed to cover?  If not, you
may be looking at the prototype of Taliesin's new comprehensive martial arts
system!

	Thanks for your help guys,

	Mark:  I think you are right.  People will never be happy if they
can't roll their damage dice.  I'll probably opt for the small dice plus
a guarenteed amount of damage.  Sigh, who said gamers were logical?

	Alex:  Thanks for clearing up what you intended when you outlined
the martial arts styles and the skills that made them up.  I thought that 
it was a bit much to think that Shotokan had more kicking skills than Tae
Kwon Do, but I wasn't sure how far your bias for Shotokan (and against 
Tae Kwon Do) went ;-)  I appologize for the false accusation.
	I don't think you should worry about making general skills consistant
with the other types of support skills.  They already differ in that they can
apply to several different skills.  Allowing them to increase support skills
is not that great a step, or that confusing, and I think it would make for a
nice system.  Besides, it's not like you to refuse an idea for the sake of
conceptual ease.  :-)

	I don't have a problem with recovery times being equal to 1/2 weapon
speed.  I chose, however, to make them equal to weapon speed for several 
reasons:  1)  It is really difficult to say exactly how long it takes to 
recover a weapon.  It is probably no greater than the weapon speed, but no
less than 1/2.  I use 1x weapon speed because it is easier and not necessarily
less realistic.  2)  Linear attacks would, I believe, be able to be recovered
only as quickly as they are made.  The weapon would follow the same path, but
in reverse.  Swinging attacks could be recovered more quickly than the attack
since the weapon takes a more direct route back to a ready position, but I'm
not willing to complicate my system to make that distinction.  3)  Most 
importantly, consider energy.  I think it may be *possible* to recover most
attacks (the non-linear ones) more quickly than the weapon speed.  That does
not mean that that is how it actually happens.  Fatigue is a major factor in
most combats.  Usually it is worth burning the extra calories (=fatigue) to
strike an opponent quickly, because you have to hit the target before it
disappears.  It is not usually worth burning extra calories to pull your 
weapon back as quickly as possible.  It is usually done fairly quickly anyway,
and usually not done as concious action.  Maybe if you are fighting an
aikidoka or someone with a main gauche it would be worth your while to make
it a concious action, but generally I don't believe as much effort and energy
is put into recovering a strike as launching it.  

	I remembered another skill for the "comprehensive" list--sacrifice.
I also thought of another thing I hadn't covered.  I'm not sure how to model
this, but I would also throw in a skill or set of skills to cover fighting
stance.  Can you guys think of any aspect of unarmed combat that I have
failed to cover?

Jeff suggests:
>If you do decide to go that route though, what do you think about giving 
>characters rank # of speed points (instead of Rank-2)?  It is a little less 
>confusing (it would help to balance out the splitting of points)

You are actually getting rank.  If you have no skill in something you are at
-2 INIT with it.  Every rank adds a spd point.  I think i would keep
the RANK -2 for that reason!

>The way I have weapons listed currently, the
>weapon speed includes the recovery time.  That is why you may use half your
>weapon speed when you are "en garde." 

	My weapon speeds do not really handle recovery- they are the time it 
takes to strike with the weapon from a ready position.  I agree that it 
would be good for you to change the weapon tables.  I assume you would be 
differentiating out the recovery times, right?

>As to the -20% to any action which is completed
>while another is recovering (I am reading that correctly, right?)--I don't
>know if that is necessary. 

	I am not sure how complicated it is really going to be.  People 
can probably handle it.  It won't even become an issue unless they are
doing a very detailed combat and then it might be worth it.  ANd it will
make fights tend to a more realistic time scale.  I was thinking of being fairly generous with recovery and let it take place as a background action.

FOr instance Edgar with rank 8 in sword(giving him 3 init counts under the 
new way), and a spd of 5, swings a 10 count long sword.  He rolls an
initiative of 9.  He would normally react at 4.  But he can begin recovering
at 1(4{rolled init -base spd}} - 3{init from sword skill}).  Thus he will be
done recovering with the long sword at 6!  He can begin doing something else 
at 4 though- with another limb or skill.    

In other words you don't roll a seperate initiative for the recovery action but you use the next init you roll and run it in the background of whatever
action the character is doing next.  This is I think more relaistic, and
maybe even a better way to handle florentine as well since we are dealing 
with one mind...  thoughts- or have I completely blown you guys away with 
this?

Another way to say:
	If you are performing multiple actions, you still only roll
one inititive roll and the INIT values for all the actions are derived using that one roll.  

KATA:
All I ma saying about this is that the normal size of KAta in many martial 
arts is probably too big to handle as a single grouping of skills in a gaming
system.  Often they are repetitive and only deal with a small group of skills.
I was trying to universalize skill grouping and define the parameter sof
many skills, and how specific they have to be(RIOGHT NOW a kata in BT has to 
include whether the attack is upper, mid, or lower level; and has to include 
what support skills it uses.  Is this specific enough? 

I like Jeffs idea about activating a Kata by doing the first movement at no 
bonuses and then having it be a linear stream.
