Jason,

In designing my own game, I've dividen the quality/quantity issue
this way: CON is an attribute that applies to humans, orcs, rocks,
locomotives, and so on, and reflects what the being is made out
of.  Grantite might have a CON of 25, for example, and this is
entirely qualitative: it might be a pebble or an asteroid made of
granite, it still has CON 25.  HP (hit points) are entirely
quantitative, and vary directly according to an object's mass.
I forget the exact figures, but basically anything 100 kg has, say,
21 HP, whether it's a steel door or a giant amoeba.  Now there's
another characteristic called ARM (armor) which also varies by
material structure, and this varies by type of material (iron,
play-dough, etc.) and also by how strudily the thing is built:
an iron bridge will have more ARM than strands of iron wire.
Actually I think CON also goes down if the structure is flimsy,
I'll have to check on that.  But HP always reflect mass, and have
nothing to do with internal toughness.
