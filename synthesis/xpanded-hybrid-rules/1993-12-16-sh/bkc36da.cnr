Agreed, we need to start our own list.
The idea *is* very appealing.

Yes these are big problems to avoid, and coming to an agreement on how
to avoid them could also be troublesome.

a) We need to work incrementally.  Perhaps starting with a set of Attributes
   for game objects.  And we need to realize that we can always change thing
   things so we don't get hung up on choices.

WAIT..  I'll restate that..
   We *could* begin to work incrementally...
   We *could* realize that...

b&c) There seems like some good organizers on this thread.  Basically try
   to submit things that fit in and include, instead of exclude.  If we
   start with the CHECKLIST as a starting point and keep to MODULARITY
   concept, everyone can insert parts that will work.  Then as individuals
   we can use or abuse the PD parts as we like or don't.  Maybe it won't
   fly (create substance), but it still would be fun to try.

d) Email is our current reality.

I think this is right.  We should (probably) focus on a generic modularity
methodology starting with Adam's CHECKLIST document.  Identify some problems
that the document reveals, and begin to attack them.  If we focus on being
helpful and work together, then I think we can get some good ideas and
methods worked out.  And maybe we can even begin to form the nucleus of a
good game system.

Lets GO FOR IT!
