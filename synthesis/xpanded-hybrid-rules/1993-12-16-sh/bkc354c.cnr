	I'll add my name to the list of people who are seriously into game
design.  I started about 10 years ago by modifying AD&D (the only system I
knew).  After 4 years of modifications, it had evolved into a completely
original system.  For the past 5-6 years I have been working on it on and
off.  Recently I have been working on it quite a bit, and in August I printed
out a handbook for my players.  So many of them encouraged me to publish the
system that I am beginning to work seriously toward that end, but there is
a lot of work to do.  It is amazing how many rules and mechanics that
satisfied me for years fall apart when I think of trying to sell the public
on them.
	Not to de-rail this game design thread, but I have been running into
a problem lately, and I wonder if any of you fellow game designers have run
across the same thing.  Over the last few years, I have put a great deal of
thought into my system.  Inevitably this leads to changes in the system.
Although a few of my players are fellow game designers, the majority have
suffered through so many system changes that the mere words "game design"
will send them into convulsions (stop laughing Jim :)
	The big problem is that constant changes in the system confuse the
players, make them uncertain about their abilities, and detract from the
campaign.  On the other hand, if I never test the changes, I'll never
improve the system.  Any of you game designers figured out a good way to
test out your systems without annoying your players?
