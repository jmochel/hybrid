Sounds good, Except for the following(1*):
    Game design is not composed of a series of design tasks easily
    seperable from one another the way a programming project is.
    The step you pass over so blithely, creating the basic concepts,
    is where 90% of your design work will actually be. If it is not,
    then each change in some portion of the rule system will cause
    ripples through each other component of the design. Try changing
    movement rules in any system that does not have a unified design
    concept such as AD&D(2*) without modifying the combat and spell
    casting sections ! Besides, I would love to see people agree on
    the GUIDELINES !

    1*) Keep in mind that I tend to design from the reality
    standpoint. If you want to ignore reality then internal
    consistency becomes a lot less important.

   2*) Not knocking AD&D, just acknowledging that AD&D was designed
   without any overall concern for internal consistency or connections
   with reality.
