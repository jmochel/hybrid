This is indeed one of the biggest problems I've run into.  How do you
specify quality vs. quantity.  Often game attributes seem to mean both
depending on the situation.  The problem is basically this:

  I have a ROCK with CONS=70  If I have another ROCK (twice as big)
  Does it have a CONS=140?  Or does CONS really just refer to the ROCK's
  ability to maintain shape/size - constitution?  IE if I have a ROCK of
  the same (original) size that is made of better alloys etc, does it have
  a higher CONS because of its construction?

Obviously maybe CONS isn't the right attribute to be talking about.  But,
what is needed is a way to distingish between quality and quantity.  Also
the quality of an object's attributes can change in a given situation.
Take a Steel Javelin for instance.  If I hold it horizontally and ram it
into the head of a Big ORC with a solid metal helm, it might bend or break
or push him back.  BUT, if I (as is more likely) thrust it at the head of
a Big ORC with a solid metal helm... Well you get the picture.  The quality
of an object often really depends on its application *and design*.
This is what GMing is all about of course.  But a well designed system
should help out.

Yes, this is very interesting.
