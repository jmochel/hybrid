Friends, Gamemasters, fellow Lakota, lend me your ears...
        I have watched all of you fill my mail directory and memory with
your ideas for a new RPG. Cool. As an engineer, ROTC cadet, general
manager of the campus radio station, and game master/player (Yes, all at
the same time.) I have to say that the organization and methodology for
accomplishing our desired goal is uncool. I'm not putting down the efforts
and work that has been done so far, but I'm getting a little annoyed at
the volumes of stuff that's flooding my account.
        I joined this list-serve a couple weeks ago in search of people
who could help me with GM'ing. Several of you have been extremely helpful
for my few queries. I would like to return the favor to the board in some
manner.
        I am not as well versed in the different RPG's that are on the
market as everyone else is, but I do know why some of those games are
popular. I also feel that I have a good sense of problem solving, something
that a project like this is going to need. (Problem solving is one of the
few things that I was praised for at Advanced Camp @ Fort Lewis. Unfortunately
sensitivity was not.) What I'm leading up to is not that I'm the RPG
organization god, far from it. What I'm saying is that I would like to present
some comments on the efforts so far that I would like people to think about
before they continue on. If you have been sufficiently insulted, chaotic, or
simply don't give a damn, then delete this on right away.
        One of the things that they teach us in ROTC is "Don't reinvent the
wheel." If something has been done by somebody else and it works, then
change/adapt that to what you want to do. In reference to designing an RPG,
why not take the basic ideas that other games have and build upon them? The
companies that make these games have tested their ideas and made sure that
they work. [Except for 1st Ed. Mechwarrior. ;)] One of the things that you'll
notice among the more popular RPG's is their simplicity. AD&D and Shadowrun
are games that I would say are fairly simple yet complex enough for people
to play and enjoy. My first suggestion would be to take a look at the games
that are popular and flexible and take ideas from them.
        The next topic of flaming is organization. This effort has been well
intentioned but poorly organized. One aspect of well run organizations is a
central point of leadership; ie. a leader. Somebody is going to have to step
in and be an unbiased arbitraitor. This leader should make unbiased decisions
based upon the suggestions of others. If nobody is going to coordinate this
effort, then everybody might as well quit now.
        Please, before anymore progress is attempted on attributes, please
save me an hour a day of clearing my account of unwanted mail. Let's save
some time for everyone and get organized before we get to work. From there
we can make one kickass game.

                                Thank you for your time...

                                        Matt Murray
