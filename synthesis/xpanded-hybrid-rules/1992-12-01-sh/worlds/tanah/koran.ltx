^U^BPhysical Resources^b^u

Aligoth         
     The city state of Aligoth has a number of very important resources.
It has two deep, steady, and navigable rivers. It lies in a rich fertile
valley with heavy forests and good farming. There are large deposits of
Iron, and copper as well as some gold.

Meara           
     The Duchy of Meara is at a higher altitude than Aligoth ut it also
has access to two rivers though these are not navigable at all. Despite
this Meara has a gorgeous seaport called Solana as well as many silver and
Copper deposits. 

Kerny           
     Kerny is as high as meara and without a decent port, however there
are several plants and fruits which seem to grow only in the Kerny soil an
thus there are many wines and luxury goods from the area. There is some
silver mining in the eastern hills of Kerny.
