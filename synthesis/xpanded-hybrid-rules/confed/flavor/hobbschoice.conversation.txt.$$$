Scene: Mars City 
Trade Center Inn in the old city.

The old city had been settled over a hundred years ago and yet no mention could be 
found of the formal name of the main meeting room in the Trader's Inn. The Smoky
Back Room had been its name in written and spoken form for as long as any could 
remember. 

Not that it was truly smoky, no Mars City resident would ever condone the burning 
of organic materials in an open area. Even now, the conditioned response held strong,
and the laws had relaxed little. But still a miasma hung over the room's occupants as 
if the mental residue of thousands of quasi-legal and illegal bargains had left their 
mark in the wood and plascrete of the walls.
