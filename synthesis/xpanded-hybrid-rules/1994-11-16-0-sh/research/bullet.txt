*  Channel 1 Trial Account and System Information *
^^^
   Channel 1 operates on a high speed LAN in full color.
   We are user supported.  
   In the spirit of Shareware, we offer *limited* free access 
   on our public lines to validated callers. 
   This provides you the opportunity to explore our resources and try us out.  

   Expanded access privileges require Membership.
   Membership is its own validation, and callers may sign up for a
   Membership at any time.  Bulletin 3 contains all the information.

   The Bulletins - How to Use Channel 1, How to Read Messages on Channel 1, 
   How to Download, and Channel 1 Commands Reference - can be read or captured
   or downloaded.  Together, these 'help' Bulletins are archived
   in the file Chan1hlp.zip. 

   We encourage you, once you are validated, to explore all the Menus 
   and system functions which are accessible from the main command menu. 

   Channel 1 operates 24 hours a day except for maintenance 3x a week,
   usually on Tuesday and Friday mornings, and from midnight to 2 am
Help, NS, N=Stop, (Enter)=More?    following the last day of each month.

   To get your free trial public line account validated: 
>> complete the New Caller S ignup questionnaire - S from main prompt,
>> read/capture this Bulletin,
>> be validated by postcard.  (We will send).
   All callers must abide by the terms of the User Agreement, Bulletin #2.

   Starting access time for the validated trial account is 26 minutes daily.
   Validated callers have access to conferences, email and file transfer
   facilities, the offline reader DOORs, and other functions including
   some of the online entertainment in the Games Conference.
   Download access is contingent on uploading; see below.
   
>> Once validated, your free trial account will last 80 days from    
>>the time of your first log-on.

   Callers who contribute significant good uploads as trial account 
   holders are welcome to request an extension of free access 
   <if their overall byte ratio is in the 1/2.5 range> if they are
   committed to continuing to upload regularly and often, as may
   software authors and callers who don't download at all and call
   only occasionally.
Help, NS, N=Stop, (Enter)=More? ns
   Serious uploaders will also gradually gain more time on the system.
   See Table below for details.

Time spent uploading is matched with
extra time and extra bytes for the uploader for that session.
   --------------------------------------------------------------------

   To maintain downloading privileges as a trial account holder, 
   uploading is required:  1 upload for every 4 downloads.  
   Enter the command V <iew> at the main menu prompt to see
   the current statistics of YOUR account.

   However some basic files are provided "FREE" to trial account holders 
   and to Members alike.  First-time callers may access many of these
   files from the Help/Free Files Conference -- J 5 at the main prompt.
   
   These are:   
   The files list -- CHANNEL1.ZIP, CHAN1DIR.ZIP or CHAN1A/B/C/D/E/F.ZIP 
   The help files -- CHAN1HLP.ZIP
   The upload directory -- CHAN1UP.ZIP
   Recommended communications programs -- BOYAN401/2.ZIP
TLX312-1/2/3.ZIP
QM42F#1/2/3/4/5.ZIP
   Gif viewer -- VPIC<latest version Z Uploads, DIRs 67, 29>.ZIP
   Zmodem -- DSZxxxx.ZIP <latest version Z Uploads, Dir2>
   Mail Readers for QMail Door -- EZ133.ZIP   -EZ Reader
DELUXE2.ZIP -New v.Trial Qmail Reader
QPATCH.ZIP <old v.QMail adjunct file>
ROBOxxxx.ZIP
   Information about RelayNet --  RELAYNET.ZIP
   Virus checking program recommended for use after unzipping -- SCANV75.ZIP
or latest   SCANVxx.ZIP
   Virus curing program in conjunction with Scanvxx-- CLEAN75.ZIP
or latest  CLEANxx.ZIP

Channel 1 routinely checks all of its system files with the latest
virus checking programs - and offers all validated callers the
latest version of SCANVxx.ZIP as a free download <from DOOR 2>,
to provide you with the capability to check both the software you
download here when you unZIP it, and the rest of your software.
All incoming uploads are also filtered through the latest SCANV
before being posted.

   And another free download is the compress/decompress utility -- PKZ110.EXE  
and the decompress utility alone -- DEZIP.EXE

   The source code files for the Microsoft Journal are 
   available  - to all registered callers -
   regardless of the status of their account.
   These files are accessed from the Microsoft Conference.  
   Enter J;6 at the Main Menu prompt to get to the Conference.

   Conference 1 is the Channel 1 Mail Box.
   First time callers can leave Receiver Only messages here to known
   Channel 1 callers.  And both validated callers and Members can exchange
   private files.  Enter J;1 at the main menu command to access.
   Bulletin 1 in the Mail Box has full details.

A few tips to help you:

 =>The command F ile V iew <exact filename.xxx> allows you to
   view the contents of a  .ZIP file and to read
   text or documents portions of it before you download.  
   This can help you determine if you want the program.


 =>Z searches of the files directories for keywords or filenames 
   Z  <keyword/ or partial string (no wild cards)> from the main board
   or from ProDoor or ZDoor are now very fast and are well worth
   doing to find out latest version of a file that is already here, or
   to ensure that you are not uploading an older version, or
   simply to find what interests you. 
   Example:  Z OFFLINE | READER will list all files that have EITHER 
word in their description.
Z OFFLINE & READER will list all files that have BOTH   
words in their description.
   <Z H> will provide more information on line.

=>T entered at the main menu prompt allows you to select your
    transfer protocol.  Once you set, or reset, your choice here
    you will no longer be asked to enter your choice 
    every time you download.

=>X at the main menu prompt toggles the main menu on/off.
    Once you are familiar with the main menu commands, use this to
    save yourself the menu scroll time between each command entry.

   --------------------------------------------------------------  

   Please note that *one* trial account only is allowed per person, 
   family or computer system.  

   Callers are not to use "aliases" or "handles" for their trial account.

   Inappropriate or duplicate uploads will receive negative credit.
Please NO COMMERCIAL SOFTWARE EVER.
     >>  Inappropriate uploads may result in loss of access.  <<

   Uploads must be recent files and not renamed duplicates.
^^^^^^
   Uploads that we do not keep will not get credit.

   .ZIP all uploads.  Credit will not be given for .ARC or uncompressed
   uploads.  The .ZIP utility - PKZ110.EXE is available as a free download.

   Uploaders of quickcash schemes will lose all access.
   
   Free access will be denied summarily whenever evidence of disregard 
   for these rules appears. 


   Validated public line callers who have not taken out a Membership 
   and trial account holders have limits on their downloading privileges,
   over and above the free downloads described above.
   They must maintain a ratio of 1 useful upload for every 4 downloads.
 > The chart below describes the full extent of access times 
 > and downloading privileges possible without a Membership.

   Remember that when you upload your time/bytes increase for that session.

How to Use Channel 1
--------------------

General Information
-------------------
Feel free to explore any of the system's features. Help is available
online at most prompts (H or ?), as well as in bulletins, tutorials,
viewable/downloadable files, the Help conference (J:5 at the main 
command prompt), and in the file CHAN1HLP.ZIP.


Timesaving Tips
---------------

1) Download Channel1.zip or Chan1a,b,c,d,e,f.zip for the filelist;
Chan1hlp.zip for help with Channel 1.  This includes the PCBoard
Help files, as well as much other helpful information.

2) If PCBoard (Channel 1's software) is new to you, read or capture
Bulletins 7-10, -- available in Chan1hlp.zip -- and Pcbhelp.zip,
the command reference, available in Bulletin 20.

Help, NS, N=Stop, (Enter)=More? ns4) Capture messages & reply off-line; or use the QMail/Markmail doors.

5) Use Zmodem or Y-modem protocol if possible.  Batch transfers.  DB, UB.

6) Use control-S to pause a non-stop display of files
or messages, & ctrl-K to abort.  Use to abort check for mail!

7) Answer y;q or n q to the graphics prompt to skip the
welcome screen; add ns to skip the news as well.

8) Use f;v or f v to view the filenames & dates within
a zip. This may save you from down/uploading
outdated or duplicate files.  Use Prodoor/Zdoor to read
text files within zipped files.

9) Use z)ippy to scan the filebase: see below.

10) Capture the File Directory and print it out so you can specify
directories that you need z)ippy scanned for particular files.
Chan1hlp.zip has all the menu screens.

11) Use q)uickscan to scan messages: see below.

12) When reading messages, use t)hread (+/-) to skip
directly to replies.

13) Use PCBoard H)elp and ?.

14) Use x)pert mode to eliminate menu scrolling between
each command.  Toggle x)pert to return to menu.

16) Use Prodoor or Zdoor mail systems, or better
yet the Qwikmail Door.  See the Doors themselves and the "How to"
Bulletins, 6-10.

17) Last, but not least, use an up-to-date version of one of 
the major Shareware  communications programs:
TELIX, QMODEM, PROCOMM, or BOYAN.
The most recent file names of these programs is listed in
B ulletin #1.  
Once validated, you may download any of the above "free" -
these files will not count against your account.


Commands Information
--------------------

     Our message and file base is quite large.  Be selective with scans
(specify directories when possible) since they can take a long time otherwise.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Zipfiles: most files on the system are compressed.  You must use a
program to access them.  Use  PKZ110.EXE, found in directory #1 or Uploads.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Use DOOR/OPEN to gain access to special functions, such as extended protocols,
batch transfers, database searches and online games.  Each DOOR has its
own help; don't hesitate to just explore.

To D ownload, you must have a compatible communications program capable
of error-corrected file transfers.  D ownload from the main or F iles prompt:
d;filename.zip;y.  This transfer uses y-modem protocol.

Remember that you can download any file on the Main Board from the
Main Board Command prompt.  All you need is its exact name.
Conference specific files have to be downloaded from the Conference
main prompt.


DOORS and OPEN access auxillary programs which serve as extensions or 
enhancements to PCBoard.  ZDoor and ProDoor, for instance, provide the
capability of using other protocols, batch transfers, zipfile utility
functions, and for Prodoor, message base functions.  Feel free to play 
with the Doors system.  You can't do anything wrong.

E nter messages.  Messages may be written off-line, saved into ASCII files,
and uploaded into your message (ASCII transfer).  **Do not use TABS in your
messages.**  Line lengths less than --> 72 <-- characters work best.

F)iles will access the board File Directories: f;1 or f 1 2 ns.
F)ile V)iew will view the filenames in a ZIP.

Graphics M ode: If your communications program does not support ansi
graphics, consider using one of the fine pd or shareware comm programs
available: Qmodem, Boyan, Telix, Procomm or Pibterm.  These and others are
available on the board. In order to use g)raphics, your program must support
ansi-bbs graphics, and you must have ansi.sys or it's equivalent installed in
your config.sys file.  Channel 1 needs to be seen in full color!

Use the H)elp and ? commands; PCBoard H)elp is extensive for all commands and
can help you learn to use the sytem.

J oin Conferences: System activity is organized into Conferences & specific
B ulletins, Messages (R ead), & F iles are accessible only in Conferences.
Some conferences may be "echoed" through daily mail transfers to other sytems
around the country.  Refer to the system Bulletins for more information.
Check the F ile directories in each conference, where (w/files) is indicated
in the main conference menu. A)bandon to exit to the main menu or J;# to
move from conference to conference.

Q uickscan for message headers: q s or q;3000-.

R)ead messages with the R)ead command.	
Use R)ead S)ince to read messages since your last call or message entry.  
Commands may be stacked: r;s or r s.  
Use the +/- keys to read forward: r;3000+ or backward: r 3000-. Once
entered only an <enter> is necessary to continue reading.	
R L to begin reading at the end of the message base.

Use the T)hread command to follow a message chain by subject: t+ or t-.  

Check for Your mail with  Y at the  main command menu:
At the prompt which follows, select:
C urrent to get list of all your mail in Main Message base or in the
  conference you are currently in.
S ince to get list of all your mail since last reading or message entry.
A ll to get list of all your mail everywhere on the system.
Y A S NS (all your mail since last on, for instance, with no breaks in the 
presentation).  
R A S Z to capture all your mail and download in to you.

Z ippy is the basic search command for files. 
Use  Z ippy directly from the main command menu to search for files as
follows: z single keyword or stacked keywords (| between words), then 
at the prompt, if possible, to save time, 
specify the directories you'd like searched.

Description:  Disconnects you from the host system.  This command should always
              be used to log off of the system to insure proper updating of all
              message pointers, etc.  NEVER just drop carrier by issuing an
              (Atl+X) (or equivalent) command to your communication's software
              without first entering the (G) command!

              Some systems also ask that you complete a (S)cript Questionnaire
              at the time of logoff.
