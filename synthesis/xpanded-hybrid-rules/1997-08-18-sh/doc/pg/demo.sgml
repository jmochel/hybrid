        The player starts with 125 points for statistics and 10 points in the Personal 
        Development Pool. 
        </para>
        <para>
        With these points the player buys what is needed for the initial 
        character development. This includes the Race, Special Abilities, and 
        Culture of the character. 
        </para>
        <para>
        Then the player generates the history of the character. The player 
        picks the career path the character will follow and uses the results 
        of that career to put points into the other pools.
