\item[Skill Based] 
\item[Modularity]
\item[Scalability] The game system should be able to handle 
increasing/decreasing levels of complexity without breaking down

\end{enumerate}

1. Unification: Stats should apply equally to PCs, NPCs, Vehicles, Monsters, etc...
2. Skill based: Allow characters to be created through a choice of skills amnd
knowledge.
3. Modularity: The individual systems within the RPG should be modular
4. Scalability: The GM and players should be able to tailor the scale
of the game to fit. GM should have control over the speed of combat,
rate of play etc.. The rules should supply the fundemental detail
and offer scalability rules... The rules aren't optional- they simply
expand...
