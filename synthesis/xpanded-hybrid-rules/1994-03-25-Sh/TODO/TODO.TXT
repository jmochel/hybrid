Each section includes a description of what the topic is (in reality)
and how it is done (game mechanic wise).

+ Expansion rules should be clearly displayed
+ Tables should be as close as possible to their point of 
reference. They also need a caption and a ?border?

Take a look at a full page environment for reproducing the look of
a page or description inside it.


General Notes
------------------------------------------------------------
SCALES
	Mental and Physical 
    Time
    Distance
    Damage

Fatigue and Exhaustion
Lifting
Drugs 
	Formats, Saves, Summary data, poisons

Encounters
	Give a BC of an encounter based on the population density
    of people/objects/places. Use the crit tables to indicate 
	anything more than the usual for that area.

Action/Reaction
------------------------------------------------------------
Basic Rxn/Action sequencing
Action: speed/% chance tradeoff
	Only setup allows you to take more time.

1) dtm distance and circumstances
2) dtm perception (if needed)
3) dtm initiative
	2d8 
	+ 5 // for failed perception
    + 5 // Buffer
	- Speed points

Speed Pts = 1/2 Rank in skill

Spend them on 
1) Speeding up a blow.
2) Buying addituional perception rolls
3?) Save for a second reaction roll ?
4?) Offset multiple strike decay

How long does a perception roll stay in effect ? 
- until the next action ?
- until a change of target or disengage

reaction time lower limit = 1 pulse
2d6 for reaction time + buffer ?
2d8 for reaction time + buffer ?
For init vs perception - speed points can always be applied BUT your 
	rxn may outrace your perception BUT what a headache for making presets 
    seem useful.
What about perception skills adding to the speed of perception rolls.....

Perception 
  explanation 
  discussion of effect
      what you get for a successful roll.
      what you lose if you don't have full perception of an event

Preset reactions allow speed points to be used immediately as if 
a skill is already in use. ? Is there still a DF+2 to perception.

Speeding and action costs speed points or accuracy.

Spd     Spd Pts  or Accuracy
3/4		5			?
1/2		10			?
1/4		15			?
1/8		30			?

Speed pt cost = some formula ?

- what do I do with people who use both methods to speed up 
an action.

QuickDraw should buy more speed points for drawing the weapon.


EEPS
------------------------------------------------------------
	Detailed notes on EEPS and Training
	Base EEPS (You ran ...)
	Character EEPS ( How well you roleplayed)
    Skill Use EEPs ( How well you manipulated the game)
    Scenario EEPS ( Special)
	Char EEPs and Skill EEPs shuld be equal in mgnitude.

Character Gen
------------------------------------------------------------
Process
    * Racial Templates - have a cost
	* Cultural Templates - have a cost ( avg cost = 0 )
	* Limitations/Enhancements
    	Design costs
	* Career template
    	Skill points generated in a career can only be used in the
        career's skills.
	* What about debt.
	* Wealth/Status Ads/Disads
    	Status gained in a career path only applies there. 
        There should be  playboy career path.

	Add in detailed discussions of hard coded skills like movement
	Do up character sheets
		Add in specifics of various hard-coded skills such as movement
	Change the point pools to ?
	Add optional no-roll generation
	Discuss what status/wealth get you
    Discuss interchangeability of PD/Wealth/Status skills
    How to put a cap on power acquired by generating an old PC ?
    	- Add cost for maintaining stats  ?
        - Or add power ratings (GM based limits )
	Stat Buying

Skills
------------------------------------------------------------
    Data sheets and filters
    Packages
    Add in DF relation to Skill Type
	More abstract => harder to do
	More lore => harder to learn
    Is Data Analysis a Skill - Yes - consider it a general skill and it makes sense
	Discuss some of the typical skill names like LORE:, ME: etc
    What about being able to use supports skills as primaries and vice-a-versa ?
	Break skill lists down by category	(Magick/Psi/Tech/Combat/General)
	There are no support skills but specific skills can be used in 
		a support role for 2% per rank.

	General vs specific skills.
		Filter
    	General => 1% skills 
		Specific => 4% 

		BC = 2 * SB(skill) + RB + Skill Pool (If applic) 		

	Skill Pools
    	
        * Does the speed of a skill pool (avg rank) 
		override the speed of a slower skill.

		* How many skills per pool or package ?
        Is there a limit ?

		* Skills must be bought into or out of a pool
        A selft taught buy-in is more expensive ? 

		* Skills may be grouped by tool category or by
        training style ? Which is primary ?

		* We need a rank-to-effect function.
			The average rank could work or the average of the top 3 skill


Tasks
------------------------------------------------------------
	Describing tasks 
	Desc/Name -  DF - Time - ApplicableSkills - Any special notes

Cyber/PSI/Magick
------------------------------------------------------------
All agents have the same attributes

Resistance DF/Penetration
QE
DF
EC
CT
RNG
AOE
DUR
Visibility
Integrity/Durability


Each of these agents has a common expression.
Magick - sorceries
Psi - disciplines
Cyber - Programs

PSI measures how much power the caster can access and skill dtms how well 
it can be molded to their will.

Is there a relationship between the power of the agent a 
character can create and their skill in the appropriate area.

PSI- Discipline Design
Magick - Spell  design
Cyber - Net Programming

Maybe the above skills are filter skills.

Power (agent) is proportional to TimeTaken + ???

Should I add a special requirements attribute for design to 
handle things like teleport ?


equate QE to KE
do up the spell research system
priestly magic
Add in magic defense

Divinations notes
	Factors to manipulate
    1) Accuracy of detail - what happened
    2) Accuracy of Presentation - How it looked
    3) Depth - Background

They key is to determine how much of QE is used by each category

Cover priestly magic
Come up with typical tassk times

LORE:Wizardry 
ME: Fire
PERC: Mana

Critical miss notes
Casting takes a full action.
	Does it allow for perception rolls ?

Rules for casting Stealthily 
Rules for altering attributes
Concentration checks
maintaining spells
energy cost
what about magic resistance rolls
Magical Parries and Dodges
Offensive vs Defensive spells - opposing rolls ?
Ceremony and group spells.

Most spells that have a difficult to limit element should be 
related to the stats of a caster.

Enchanting an item conts toward studying the spell and 
studying enchantment.

Rune Magery
	Runes can be used for components or as a type of stndalone magick.
    To use Rune Magery the mage must use a skill called rune activation.
    ? This allows therune mage to create a permanent scroll that contains 
	no power. ?

Alchemy
	Is much the same as Rune Magery.
    Requires an activatuion and an enchantment.

Spirit magery and summoning

QE
	A table will have to be drawn up for QE 
    QE = fxn(MST) for Enchantment
    QE = fxn(Material Type) for Transmutation.
	
Design: Time scales should be on one table nd related to a formula:
it would remove severa columns , the same is true for range.

A moderate spell (3-4 MFT) spell should be able to do 2d10 
in PFT worth of blunt damage.


Sorcery Sheet
	Base Type of sorceries
		Attack(targeted)
    	Attack(aoe)
		Shield(targeted)
    	Shield(aoe)
        Detection

	Some of the sorceies are probably derived from actions.

	Should targeing be a seperate action ?

Spell Research Steps
	1) Design the spells and add up the SDP
    2) DF of skill is K - SDP // Where K is currently 20
    3) For each phase of problem solving 
    	Assign a DF to it based on the faculties available
		1) Formulate
		2) Retrieval
        3) Calculate/Correlate
		4) Verify

The idea is to get the DF as positive as possible before rolling 
against the spel design skill.

All DFs can be modified by time as per self training.

Time of the spell research can be applied as traing against the spell
using Teacher mods.

ST 
------------------------------------------------------------
	Add notes on what stats are used for what kind of save 

	They can be used in situations where experience/luck can aid a 
	character's survival without direct application of skill.

	Explosions		PAG
    Poison			PEN
    Willpower		MST
	Magic(AOE)		MDF or PSI

	Saving throws are applied with normal skill BC calculations

Backlash Table
Maintainence of equipment
Repair cost = (1% of base cost)  x (DF of repair)

Functional Model for ships
--------------------------
Everything can be modeled with 
    Durability	// Damage it can take
    Armour		// How much damage it won't take.
    QE			// How much energy it gives out 
    Power      // How much power it uses or generates

So a ship would consist of a series of functional groupings like 
Power Sources, Sensor Arrays,  Locomotion Modules, Armour, 
Communication, etc..

The trick is to decide whether they should be listed as functional 
groupings and mapped to location or vice-a-versa.
