2 LIST OF TABLES 

Chapter 1 
Quick and Dirty Intro to 
the mechanics 
1.1 Types of Rolls 
There is one main type of roll in SpaceHybrid . The roll is made with percentile 
dice against a Success Chance (SC). If the roll is under or equal to the Success 
Chance, then the roll is successful. If it is greater than the Success Chance then 
it is a failure. 
The Success Chance is the percentage chance to perform a given task This SC 
is determined from the statistics and skill of the character and modified based 
on the difficulty of the task. The most common modifier is called a Difficulty 
Factor (DF). This is a number that typically ranges from -10 to +10. 
SuccessChance = 3 \Theta The Stat + Rank \Theta 4 +Difficulty of Task \Theta 5 
As an example if the player character has a Physical Strength (PST) of 
15, a rank in weight lifting of 4 and is trying to lift half his weight in mass 
( a Difficulty Factor or DF of -5). This means the Success Chance (SC) is 
SC = 3 \Theta PST +Rank \Theta 4 +DF \Theta 5 In the case of the weightlifting this means 
SC = 3 \Theta 15 + 4 \Theta 4 + 
is 1-100. If you roll 00 (a 100) you roll again add the 
second roll to the first to get our total. 
When percentile dice are rolled and the result is under the success chance, that 
is a normal success. When the rolled number is significantly lower than the 
needed roll there is a chance the action may have a greater than normal success. 
3 

4 CHAPTER 1. QUICK AND DIRTY INTRO TO THE MECHANICS 
This is called a ``Critical'' success. Table 1.1 on page on page 5 describes the 
rolls needed. 
As an example. If a character needed to roll a 40 or under to hit a target 
with a rock and they rolled under 1=2 of 40 then they will do 1.25 times the 
damage they would normally do. 
In the case of very poor rolls there is a chance that the roll may be a critical 
failure This is caused by rolling 50 above your success chance or rolling above 
by 1=2 the success chance of the action, whichever is greater. 
So someone with a success chance of 90 needs to roll a 140 or higher to 
critically miss while someone with a success chance of 120 needs to roll a 180 or 
higher to critically miss. 
To determine the severity of the critical failure roll against the amount missed 
by as a success chance and compare the result to table 1.2 on page 6.

Chapter 2 
Tasks and Skills 
A task is an action or a group of actions to be performed. Each task has a diffi- 
culty associated with it. That combined with the knowledge of the character's 
rank in the skill and their stats allows us to determine the percentile roll needed 
to succeed. 
To do a task the character determines the Difficulty Factor DF of the task 
and what skill(s) may be used to do the task. A base chance to BC is determined 
and modified by the difficulty factor of the task. 
Forcing a locked door is a task that has some difficulty. If the character 
has no skill in forcing doors then they are forcing the door based on using just 
physical strength. Their chance to force the door is based on their physical 
strength and how difficult the door is to force. The sum total chance to force 
the door is called the Success Chance SC. 
If the character has a skill in forcing doors then they will have knowledge 
about how best to apply their physical strength to get the door open. 
Most players will not see a task description such as this. The GM may use 
it.

8 CHAPTER 2. TASKS AND SKILLS 
2.1.2 Difficulty Factors 
The difficulty of a task is described by a number referred to as an ``Difficulty 
Factor'' or DF. Difficulty Factors for tasks typically range from -10 to +4. 
Throughout SpaceHybrid it is assumed that the base DF of an action is 0 
unless otherwise stated. 
The modifier for a task is simply 5% times the Difficulty Factor or: 
Modifier = 5 \Theta Difficulty F actor 
If there are a series of actions that can be lumped together in a single task 
the DF for the task is the average of the DFs for all the tasks. 
Jogging across the street and leaping a small fence are actions that are best 
lumped together into one task. There is no reason to ask the character to roll 
a task roll for each action. But if the character stands the chance of being 
exposed to someone looking for him then a roll should be made for the entire 
set of actions. 
There are some common actions and ways of describing actions that have 
standard DFs.

2.1.3 Stat Basis 
The task has a stat basis that describes what stat or combination of stats can 
be used to do the task. This is only used if the character has none of the skills 
in the Applicable Skills entry. 
The Base Chance for someone who has no skill is 
(3 \Theta SB skill )

2.1.4 Time 
The task will have time associated with it. This is the average time the task 
typically takes to perform. 
2.1.5 Applicable Skills 
This is a list of suggested skills that could be used to do the task. It is not 
exhaustive. 
2.2 Skills 
2.2.1 Description 
Name Self Explanatory 
Stat Basis The stat, or combination of stats, that is used by the skill. 
Difficulty Factor The modifier for doing any action with this skill. 
Generation Cost The character generation cost of a skill or skill package. 
Skills only cost 1 point. Skill packages typically vary from 1 to 10 points 
in cost. 
EP Cost The experience point cost is the amount of experience points it takes 
to buy a roll in a skill. 
2.2.2 Ranking 
Proficiency in a skill is described by a number with a range of 0-20. The higher 
the number, the greater the character's expertise. Someone is completely unfa- 
miliar with a skill is considered to be unranked. Someone who is familiar with 
the basics of the skill is rank 0. Other rankings are described in table 2.3.

2.2. SKILLS 13 
2.2.3 Stat Basis 
Each skill has a stat or a combination of stats that is called the stat basis and 
is used to calculate the base chance of using the skill. 
To use a skill the GM determines what the Base Chance of the skill is and 
adds in the modifiers for the task being performed. The Base Chance of using 
a skill is three times the Stat Basis of the skill or 
3 \Theta SB skill 
For each rank the character has in the skill add 4%. The modifiers for the task 
vary for each situation. 
A character with rank:0 in Rock Throwing is throwing a rock across 
the street. The character has a Accuracy (ACC) of 12. Their Base 
Chance to hit is 3 \Theta 12 = 36%. 
2.2.4 Gaining Skills 
A character can gain experience points for roleplaying and use those experience 
points to buy that skill.

Table 2.5: Skill Cost 

2.2. SKILLS 17 
To determine the cost of raising a skill from one rank to the next rank up 
find the row in table 2.5 that has the base cost of the skill. Find the column 
with your current rank in that skill. The cost in each column to the right is the 
cost it takes to raise a skill from the current rank. To go up in Weapon:Fist 
(base cost 2) from rank 0 to rank 1 costs 4 EEPs. To go from rank 1 to rank 2 
is another 4 EEPs and so on. 
2.2.5 Training 
For each 10 hours of training with a teacher the character gets 1 EEP. For each 
20 hours of training with a partner the character gets 1 EEP. For each 30 hours 
of self-training with a the character gets 1 EEP. 
There are all sorts of modifiers so ask.... 
2.2.6 Costs of unlisted skills 
When figuring out the cost of previously unlisted skill use table 2.4 simply add 
together all of the costs that appear to apply. 
2.2.7 Relations Among Skills 
In situations where the character does not have a skill that is directly applicable 
to the task being performed the character may choose to use a related skill. 
A typical example would be in using two different types of handguns. The 
character has rank 10 in Slug Pistol but is using a Stun Weapon. The stun 
weapon is fairly different from the Slug Pistol so the character can only apply 
1/5 of his expertise in Slug Pistol to using this pistol. So he has an effective 
rank 2 in the weapon. 
As a rule the following relations apply. 
Similiar in many respects 2/5 
Dissimiliar in many respects 1/5 
Really Stretching it 1/10 
Table 2.6: Skill Relations 
2.2.8 Unfamiliar Tools 
If the skill requires the use of tools and the tool that the character is utilizing 
is unfamiliar, then the action occurs at a DF -2. This usually only happens if 
the differences between the version of the tool the character normally uses and 
the current one actual effect how it is used. A gun with a different mass than 
the entity is used to is unfamiliar, whereas a gun of the same model and same 
manufacturer is not. To eliminate this unfamiliarity modifier requires that the 
entity familiarize himself with the tool with a DF -3 roll against the SB of the 
skill with a gain of 1 DF per roll. 

18 CHAPTER 2. TASKS AND SKILLS 
2.3 Types of Skills 
The section on skills describes the basic way that skills are handled but there 
are a variety of special types of skills that are used for special circumstances. 
2.3.1 Specialization 
Skills that are described as general skills cover a wide range of tasks with very 
little depth. A person who has learned a general skill such as Throw Object is 
able to throw just about anything they can get their hands on ( knives, spoons, 
rocks, chairs) with a lesser success chance than someone who has a specific skill 
in throwing a particular object. 
In addition, there are skills known as support skills that are solely designed to 
increase the success chance when doing one type of action with a skill. Someone 
who uses their sword to parry weapon attacks may wish to train specifically in 
parrying with a sword. So they would have a ``Long Sword' skill and a ``Long 
Sword : Parry'' skill. 
General skills only give 1%/rank to the success chance. Specific skills (the 
SpaceHybrid norm), give 4%/rank. Support Skills add 2%/rank. 
2.3.2 Filter Skills 
There is a category of skills which affects the use of other skills in an environment 
different from the one they were learned in. These skills are called filter skills. 
A Filter skill is any skill that can allow for the full expression of other skills in 
an environment other than that for which those skills were designed for. 
Typical filter skills include the following: 0-g maneuver, Tech Level Lore, 
Culture Lore, Mounted Combat, Vehicular Combat skills, Armor Wearing, and 
Computer operations. 
For situations in which the character is attempting to apply a skill in a 
environment he is not familiar with and that skill must interact with that 
environment, then the rank in the filter skill becomes the upper limit on the 
effective rank of the skill being used. 
As an example, if someone has a mounted combat skill at rank 5, he or she 
may use their archery skill up to rank 5 without making any rolls against their 
mounted combat. If the character has a higher archery skill and wants to bring 
it all to bear on a shot, they must roll against their mounted combat first in 
order to get the full use of the archery skill. 
2.3.3 Optional Rule:Skill Pools 
P oolBonus = RankHighestSkill + 1%=(SkillofMrankbeyondthefirstNskills) 
where M = 1=2RankHighestSkill and N = RankHighestSkill 
Pools may be grouped according to training style, SB, or character prefer- 
ence. 

Chapter 3 
General Play 
This chapter discusses various pieces of the game system that effect every char- 
acter. These rules are not specific to either combat or non-combat situations. 
The model of tasks and actions in SpaceHybrid is based on a series of re- 
actions and actions. When a character first enters a scene they determine how 
much they see and understand of the situation perception roll. Then they deter- 
mine how quickly they can react initiative roll. The character will react faster 
when they know what is going on and slower when they don't. If a character 
is expecting something to happen they can prepare for that occurrence preset 
reactions and speed up their response. 
Once the character has reacted they determine what they will do and then 
do the action. 
There are a variety of things that can modify the chance of doing an action 
successfully. The character can mentally prepare for the action set-up to increase 
their chances. The action can be sped up by decreasing the chance of success 
rushing an action. Actions can be performed simultaneously floretine. There 
are additional modifiers for doing something while moving or while tired and so 
on. . . 
3.1 Time Scale 
Time is referred to by the units we are used to, Hours, minutes, and seconds 
and one that is new: Pulses. A pulse is 1/10th of a second. Pulses are used in 
combat and other time critical activities. 
3.2 Perception 
Most of the time a situation is self evident. A character automatically knows 
that there is a bar in the room and how many people are in it. But if something 
could go unnoticed by the character, such as a suprise attack or something 
hidden, the player should make a perception roll. A perception roll is typically

A perception roll takes 8 pulses. A Passive Perception Roll can be made during 
any action at 1/4 the success chance of a normal perception roll. A passive 
perception roll takes no time and takes no modifiers for simultaneous actions. 
The critical success and failure effects are fairly straight forward.

3.3 Initiative (Who Goes First) 
When a character first enters a situation where action may be required they 
must determine how much they know and how quickly they react. 

3.4. ACTIONS 21 
When a character first becomes involved in a conflict they roll a perception 
roll. Then the PC rolls an Initiative roll. The Initiative roll is simply 2d6 + 8 
haracter 0 s Speed 
Initiative = 2d6 + 8 
roll is lower than 1 the excess speed goes toward speed points 
and can be applied to a number of seperate tasks. 
3.3.1 Speed Gains Due to Rank in a Skill 
The character may add Rank=2 points to their speed points when using a skill. 
This may only be done once the character has decided to use a given skill. 
3.3.2 How to avoid the math 
There is a set of tables that the GM can provide that can be used to simplify 
this. 
3.3.3 Preset Reactions 
When a character is waiting for something specific to happen and intends to 
react a certain way when it does the charcetr is presetting an action. A gun- 
fighter waiting for someone else to start drawing their weapon is a preset action. 
Having a preset action allows the character to increase the chance of detecting 
the triggering action and speeds up the preset action. Holding a preset action 
can be fatiguing over long periods of time. 
Declaring an action to be preset allows an DF +4 to a perception roll. If the 
perception roll is successful, the character gets to apply their 2 \Theta Speed Reaction . 
A Preset reaction may only be held for MST in the time scale that the players 
are working in before a cost of 1 MFT must be expended. 
3.4 Actions 
Actions normally begin at the count given by the initiative roll. The must be 
made at this point. The speed of the action is determined and the character 
takes this action on a pulse given by Initiative + The speed of the action. 

22 CHAPTER 3. GENERAL PLAY 
3.5 Speeds of Actions 
Most actions have a speed associated with them. All simple actions , unless 
otherwise noted, have a standard speed of 10 counts. 
Action Speed 
Sitting 15 
Standing 20 
Kneeling(1 Knee) 10 
Arising(1 Knee) 12 
Kneeling(2 Knee) 26 
Arising(2 Knee) 28 
Lift Light object 10 
Lift Heavy Object 40 
Any Simple Physical Action 10 
Turning 10 
Perception 8 
Table 3.2: Speeds of Basic Actions 
Actions can be performed faster. Speeding up an action lowers the chance 
of success. Generally half the time to act means you have half the chance to 
succeed. 
For each percentage of time units the action is sped up a corresponding 
percentage is removed from the success chance. Thus an action performed in 
1/4 the time has 1/4 the success chance. 
Actions can be sped up using speed points. 
3.6 Drawing a Tool or Weapon 
This most often applies to drawing a weapon but can also apply to other tools. 
In general, when a weapon is in hand, all normal weapon speeds apply. In order 
to get a weapon into ones hand it takes 2 \Theta Speedweapon in pulses. 
In order to get a weapon in hand faster than 2 \Theta Speedweapon requires a fast 
draw roll against the weapon's skill. A successful ready roll brings the tool or 
weapon to bear at Speedweapon . 
3.7 Resolving an Action 
Actions usually require only a skill roll to be made. 
3.7.1 Results 
The end result of a roll is either a numeric value or a simple subjective result. 
See the table 1.1 

3.8. MODIFIERS 23 
3.8 Modifiers 
This section describes the common Difficulty Factors for various situations. All 
these modifiers are culmulative. 
3.8.1 Unranked in the Skill 
A character who has training or experience in an action is unranked in the 
required skill. Any character performing an action using a skill they have no 
rank in has 1/2 the normal base chance and adds 2 pulses to their initiative. 
3.8.2 Set-up 
Waiting and prepping oneself for a task is called Setting-Up. It will generally 
increase the chance to do something at a cost of increased time to get it done. 
Setting Up for an action takes as long as it takes to perform the action. The 
end effect is a bonus to the Success Chance of 
20% + 2%=rank 
. 
To set-up an action with a time scale of pulses or seconds (and sometime 
minutes) the total time taken is 1 \Theta Speed Action . To set-up an action with 
a time scale of many minutes, hours, days, or weeks the total time taken is 
1=4 \Theta Speed Action . 
3.8.3 Florentine 
Performing two actions at the same time is called Florentining. 
One of the two actions is the primary action and it recieves a DF -3. The 
secondary action recieves a DF -6. This is only true if the two actions are both 
physical or both mental. If one action is a mental action and the other is a 
physical one the modifiers go down to DF -2 and DF -4.

3.8.4 Physically Injured or Tired 
A character that is injured or fatigued has DF modifiers to their actions. Phys- 
ical fatigue has the greatest effect on physical actions and Mental fatigue has 
the greatest effect on Mental actions.

3.8.5 Movement 
When performing an action the character may be affected by his rate of move- 
ment. If the character is moving faster than a walk the DF due to movement 
applys to any physical action they are attempting. ANy mental action they 
perform is subject to 1/2 the listed DFs. 
Double Move: jog DF -2 
Triple Move: Run DF -4 
Fast move: Dash DF -6 
Vehicular Movement DF -10 
Table 3.6: Movement Modifiers 
3.8.6 Environmental Conditions 
This is a catchall area. Characters generally are at their best performance in 
conditions similiar to the environment in which they were raised. Any dras- 
tic modifications from that environment in terms of light, gravity, humidity, 
etc. . . can lower the character's performance.

3.9 Fatigue and Exhaustion 
A character using energy to perform actions draws from two different types of 
reservoirs: Fatigue and Exhaustion. For physical actions the stats are Physical 
Fatigue and Physical Exhaustion (PFT and PEX). For mental actions the stats 
are Mental Fatigue and Mental Exhaustion (MFT and MEX). 
Fatigue is the quick access pool of energy a character can use. Exhaustion 
is the reserve pool of energy a character can use. 
3.9.1 Losing Fatigue 
A character loses fatigue as the result of physical activity or combat. A character 
that has lost all their fatigue has no modifiers to their actions. Fatigue will come 
back quickly. For each 10 points of fatigue used the character also loses 1 point 
of exhaustion. 
3.9.2 Losing Exhaustion 
A character loses Exhaustion by performing strenous activity or by losing fa- 
tigue. There are modifiers for being low in Exhaustion. 
Characters lose MFT and MEX in the same manner.

Table 3.11: Movement Types 
3.9.3 Restoring Fatigue and Exhaustion 
The restoration of Fatigue is usually very quick. Exhaustion and Fatigue restore 
themselves independently of each other. 
3.10 Physical Movement 
Each character has a statistic named Physical Movement. This is the character's 
movement in meters/second at a dash. There are a total of five different types 
of movement that a character may utilize. Each type of movement has its own 
movement rate which is derived from the character's movement statistic. Ideally 
the player will have the full range of movements listed on his character's sheet. 
If the movement is being resolved during a time scale of greater than every 
pulse one can get the distance traveled by simply multiplying the movement 
of the individual times the time spent moving. The time spent accelerating is 
ignored as being negligible. 
Let us say that Joe Daring spends 15 seconds running down a de- 
serted street. If he doesn't run out of street he will have covered 4 
* 15 = 60 meters. If this seems a bit short, keep in mind that a run 
is not a full dash. At a full dash Joe would have covered twice the 
distance and would be slowing down pretty drastically due to losing 
wind. 
3.10.1 Acceleration 
It is important to remember 
that the accelleration rules 
should only be used when 
the distance travelled by the 
characters over a short pe- 
riod of time is important 
In dealing with movement on a pulse by pulse scale we need to actually deal with 
acceleration. The sequence is quite simple. Whatever the final movement rate is 

3.11. MENTAL MOVEMENT 27 
Slow move: crawls, slow walks (combat ) DF -2 
Normal move: Walking DF -4 
Double Move: jog DF -6 
Triple Move: Run DF -8 
Fast move: Dash DF -10 
Vehicular Movement DF -14 
Table 3.12: Targeted Action Movement Modifiers 
that the character intends to use is considered the target movement rate. When 
the character first starts moving he makes an skill roll in order to start moving 
at the movement rate just below the target movement rate. Once the roll is 
made the character is now moving at that lower rate. On his next initiative 
the character may attempt to accelerate to the target movement. Note that the 
gain number is the movement rate. If an acceleration roll is failed the end result 
is that the character drops to the next lowest available movement rate. 
Reed Johnson has a movement of Dash 10, Run 5, Jog 2.5, Walk 
1.3, Crawl .6 
3.11 Mental Movement 
This is a measure of the character's speed of mental travel. It is usually only 
used in Psionics and Computer usage. 
3.12 Opposing Skill Rolls 
An opposing skill roll in a roll in which the character attempts to undo an action 
done previously by another character. Typically the SN of the original action 
is taken as a negative modifier to the current skill roll.

Chapter 4 
Combat 
The combat section details the types of actions that may be taken while in 
combat. The chapter on General Play must be understood before working with 
the combat details. 
4.1 Description 
Combat normally occurs on a pulse by pulse basis. The process is fairly simple: 
Determine First Reaction. For each of those reactions in order determine the 
action or attack, the damage from the attack ( if any), the secondary effects of 
that damage ( if any). Take a breath. Continue. 
4.2 First Action Determination 
As detailed in the chapter on General Play mechanics. Perception is rolled, 
initiative is determined and actions are chosen. 
4.3 Attack 
4.3.1 Closing to Attack 
When attacking someone with a weapon of greater reach than their own an 
attacker must close to get in range to strike. If the defender is aware of the 
attack and has a usable initiative the may actively resist the closing action. 
To do so they must make an skill roll using a weapon to fend the attacker off. 
Fending does not require a re-roll of initiative, the time taken for the fend (same 
as block and parry) is simply added to the defender's current initiative. 
A fend is treated as any other attack form and all active defenses can be 
performed against it. If the fend is successful and the attacker chooses to ignore 
it the fend does normal damage for the weapon. 
29 

30 CHAPTER 4. COMBAT 
Target Size DF 
Eye 1 sq'' -18 
Hand -15 
Head 1 sq' -12 
Leg/Arm -9 
Chest -6 
Table 4.1: Called Shot Modifiers 
If a character that has closed with their opponent is unarmed they may 
proceed to grapple, to throw, or to overbear. 
If the defender wishes to simply retreat they may do so. They may do so 
by rolling to fend off the closing action at a DF +6. Of course, they do end up 
moving backwards. 
If an attacker has been closed upon they may choose to drop their current 
weapon and use a shorter one, they may choose to use their current weapon as 
if it were a club, or they may attempt to retreat. 
4.3.2 Calculating Chances to Hit 
The attack has a chance to hit that comes from the SC of the weapon and is 
modified by the DF of the environment and also the defense of the person being 
attacked. Melee weapons base all their attacks on PCA. Missile and thrown 
weapons base all their attacks on ACC. 
Mental actions performed against inanimate objects is based on FCS and 
mental attacks against an entity are based on MCA. 
4.3.3 All out attack 
An all out attack means that the character is attacking without any attempt to 
defend themself. 
A character may choose to perform an all out attack and thus gain their 
MDF or PDF to their attacks and lose his MDF or PDF for defense. This is 
simply an extension to the concept of applying Total Concentration as detailed 
in the General Play Mechanics chapter. 
4.3.4 Advance 
A character may choose to press in on an opponent. In doing so they gain 
DF +4 to all offensive actions and DF -4 to all defensive actions. This is only 
possible if the attacker has a weapon of greater or equal length to the defender. 
4.3.5 Called Shots 
In any physical targeted action there is the potential to specify the location of 
the strike. That of course entails DF modifiers to the action.

Table 4.2: Hit Location 
4.3.6 Hit Location 
The target number is calculated, the roll is made. If the attack is a success then 
the damage is applied against the armour and then the target. 
All hits are checked against the hit location table. 
If any result on the Hit Location table indicates a target for which there is 
a right and a left, the one's value of the die roll determines the side. If the die 
is odd, the hit was against the left. If the die is even, the hit was against the 
right. 
4.3.7 Indirect Fire 
Indirect fire (i.e. a Lob) requires an additional DF -2. Range is the PST in 
meters. 
4.4 Damage 
4.4.1 General Notes 
All damage is calculated and then applied to the location specified by the hit 
location table. If that area is armored the damage is first applied to that armour. 
If the damage is great enough to get past the armour, the damage is then applied 
against the appropriate type of Fatigue such as PFT or MFT and then against 
the PBD or MBD of the entity. 
If the weapon has any secondary effects such as knockback or radiation they 
are applied and calculated. 
4.4.2 Critical Damage 
Any attacks that cause critical damage apply the additional damage to the PBD 
or MBD after armour. 

32 CHAPTER 4. COMBAT 
4.4.3 Types of Damage 
There are several types of damage. There is Crushing, Cutting, Piercing, Pro- 
jectile, Laser, Energy, and explosive damage. Each one is typically associated 
with a specific weapon type. 
Crushing Damage Crushing damage is damage caused by low speed blunt 
weapons such as a club, a staff, a fist, or a chair. 
Cutting Damage Cutting damage is caused by the use of slicing or chopping 
motions with an edge weapon. 
Piercing Damage Piercing damage is caused by low speed pointed objects 
entering the body along the axis of the point. 
Projectile Damage Projectile damage is caused by objects moving at high 
speeds. The only real difference between piercing or crushing and projec- 
tile damage is that the weapon moves at a high speed and imparts a high 
amount of kinetic energy to the target. 
Laser Damage Laser damage is caused by optical lasers. Damage caused by 
non-optical lasing devices such as Masers and X--lasers is classified as 
Energy damage. 
Energy Damage Energy damage (abbrev. NRG) is typically associated with 
non-optical electromagnetic weapons. 
Explosive Damage Explosive damage is, quite logically, caused by explosions. 
It is the result of a expanding wave front of gasses or minute particles. 
4.4.4 Secondary effects 
There are several types of secondary effects. There is knockback, bleeding, and 
Shock. 
Knockback 
When a character has been hit by a something with large amount of kinetic 
energy they can fall down or lose their balance. This is called Knock-Back. 
It happens when more than 1/2 of the entities PFT or 1/4 of their PBD is 
taken away in a single crushing or projectile strike. It can also happen with 
any explosive attack. The Knockback resistance roll is DF -2. If successful the 
character is unaffected. If failed the entity has fallen to the ground. The stat 
basis is typically PST or PAG whichever is greater. 
Bleeding 
Bleeding is the result of a cutting or piercing attack that has done actual PBD 
damage. The Bleeding resistance roll is DF -3. If failed the end result is 1 point 
of PFT loss to bleeding per 20 pulses. The stat basis is PEN. 

4.5. DEFENSES 33 
Roll Effect DF 
Normal Failure Jolted/Startled -2 
Failed by 25+ Stunned -4 
Failed by 50+ Badly Stunned -6 
Failed by 75+ Unconscious - 
Table 4.3: System Shock Effects 
Shock 
Shock is the state brought on by massive disruption of the senses or nervous 
system of the character. Shock effects range from the minor (startled) to the 
major (being unconscious). 
A System Shock roll is necessary when an attack does either PBD or MBD 
damage or when a successful attack is made with energy weapons such as 
Charged particle or TASER weapons. A System Shock roll is made against 
PEN or MEN. 
Recovering from being stunned or shocked means rolling every initiative roll 
pulses at not speed 2d6 + 45. 
4.5 Defenses 
4.5.1 Rolling with the blow 
OK, you know you are going to get hit, you have no time for any other defense 
then to try and roll with the blow and thus avoid being stunned or knocked out. 
The act of rolling with the blow involves an attempt to take the alloted 
damage but absorb it in such a way that the normal secondary effects such as 
stun or knockback do not take effect. The action requires no time but does 
require that the defender be aware of the attack and declare that he wishes to 
roll with the attack. The base roll goes against PAG for physical attacks and 
MAG for mental attacks. It adds DF +5 to the System Shock roll if any is 
made. The act of rolling with the blow causes a reroll of initiative. 
4.5.2 Normal Defense 
There are a number of forms of active defense. All entities, if they are aware of 
an attack, may apply their normal defense against that attack. This does not 
count as an action ! 
4.5.3 Retreating 
A character may choose to retreat any time they have the initiative to do so. 
A retreat may be performed simultaneously with any other action at no mods. 
Retreat will add DF +6 to any defensive action and DF -6 to any offensive 
action. 

34 CHAPTER 4. COMBAT 
4.5.4 Evasion 
Weaving back and forth and trying to actively avoid attacks is called evading. 
For as long as a PC is evading an attack or series of attacks their defense is 
2 \Theta PDF orMDF . The character need only declare that they are evading and 
it takes effect at their first action point. Of course the character can perform 
other actions at the same time but they will be considered as florentine actions. 
The character is at a DF +3 when performing a dodge from an evading state. 
4.5.5 Dodging 
OK, just moving out of the way is not enough, you want to be out of the area ! 
Dodging is one way to achieve that. It gives you a better defense then evading 
but it does require you to pick yourself up afterwards. 
Dodging is an extension of the normal defensive technique of getting out of 
the way. Dodging implies that the PC is actively throwing himself out of the 
path of an attack. Dodging takes 5 pulses to start, 10 pulses of movement, and 
5 pulses of deceleration. A Dodge leaves the character in the act of a controlled 
fall. A skilled individual may roll to acrobatically recover. A dodging character 
has 2 \Theta PDF during the first part of the dodge, 3 \Theta PDF during the second 
part of the dodge and normal PDF for the recovery portion of the dodge. 
4.5.6 Dropping Prone 
A specialized form of Dodge that only works within a strong gravity field. It is 
a 5 pulse action that leaves the character in a prone position. During the action 
the character has a defense of 3 \Theta PDF Once down the character has 1/2 the 
normal PDF. 30 pulses are required to get back up. 
4.5.7 Crouching 
Crouching down can be used as a one time evasive maneuver against an incoming 
attack. It is a five pulse action that gives 2 \Theta PDF against the attack. This is 
in lieu of full evasion. 
4.5.8 Parrying 
Parrying an attack involves redirecting an attacker's weapon with the character's 
own. A parry is done with a shield or weapon. DF -3, SB = Wpn SB, Speed as 
per 1/2 weapon speed. DF -5 against Thrown, DF -30 against Projectile, DF 
-40 against NRG. This is simply a skill opposition roll. 
Binding Weapons 
If a defender succeeds in a parry by less than 5% the two weapons are assumed 
to have become ``Bound'' and the attacker has advanced on the defender. See 

4.6. FANCY MANEUVERS 35 
Spinning DF -2 DAM 1.5* SPD 1.5* 
Jumping DF -3 DAM 1.5* SPD 1.5* 
Table 4.4: Melee Combat modifiers 
rules on advance. The defender may roll at their next initiative to release the 
weapon. This is a skill opposition roll. 
Overrunning 
If the attacker fails to avoid a parry by more than 25% then the attacker is 
effectively off balance and is subject to DFs just as if they had failed a system 
shock roll. 
4.5.9 Block 
A block is an attempt to use a weapon or a shield to provide addition armor 
against damage. DF -2. If the block is successful the defender rolls damage with 
the weapon and can apply that damage as armor. Speed as per 1/2 weapon 
speed. 
4.5.10 Disarm 
DF = -4, Skill opposition roll., Speed as per weapon speed. 
4.6 Fancy Maneuvers 
4.6.1 Spinning 
Any action performed while spinning has a DF -2, a damage modifier of 1:5 \Theta 
Normal Damage, and is 1.5 times slower than a normal attack. 
4.6.2 Jumping 
A jumping attack is as per spinning with a DF -3. 
4.6.3 Feint 
A feint is used to distract an opponent or to trigger an opponents preset actions. 
The main thing to remember that a feint is, in effect, a deception roll. It 
involves a weapon skill roll to convince the other individual that an attack is 
being made. The feint roll takes a DF -6. All who are within range may roll to 
save against being fooled by the feint. 
This is considered an opposing skill roll so the amount the feinted makes 
their roll by is subtracted from the feintee's perception roll. 

36 CHAPTER 4. COMBAT 
4.7 Close Conflict 
Once someone has closed to within arms reach they may choose to do any of 
the following. 
4.7.1 Overbear 
An overbear is simply performed by closing with an opponent and then making 
a normal attack using SB=PCA. Like any other attack it may be repulsed or 
actively countered. 
The gain for such an attack is to have the opponent on the ground. Damage 
for an overbear attack is simply equal to the attackers PSE. 
4.7.2 Throw 
A throw is simply performed by closing with an opponent and then making 
a normal attack using SB=PCA. Like any other attack it may be repulsed or 
actively countered. 
The gain for such an attack is to have the opponent on the ground. Damage 
for a throw attack is simply equal to the attackers PSE \Theta 2. DF -5. 
4.7.3 Grapple 
A grapple is simply an attempt to get a hand hold on the opponent. It is like 
any other attack in that it may be countered normally. 
A successful grapple gives a DF +5 modifier to any other close combat attack 
such as throw, overbear, and any attempts to increase the hold. 
4.7.4 Hold 
A hold is initiated by a grapple action and the initial strength of a hold is given 
by the SN of the grapple. If the attempt to hold or immobilize someone is the 
sole aim of the attack then the attacker may choose to improve the hold by 
rolling again. For each attempt to improve the hold the attacker may only add 
1/2 of the SN of the roll. No hold may be greater in strength than 5 * PST of 
the holder. The opponent may reduce the strength of a hold by the SN of any 
grapple skill rolls he makes. 

Chapter 5 
NPC-PC Interaction 
5.1 Outline 
This chapter discusses the rules for the various ways that the player characters 
may interact with non-player characters. 
5.2 Reaction Rolls 
A reaction roll is a roll made to determine a Non player character's reaction to 
some action on the part of a PC or NPC. It should never be rolled by a PC. 
A Reaction Roll upon encountering a PC for the first time has horrendous 
numbers of variables attached to it but as a rule of thumb the roll is DF 0, 
SB=GAW with a gain of getting the NPCs basic respect. 
5.3 Presence 
Presence is the outward reflection of an person's awareness of his environment. 
It is also known as Aura and Charisma. Presence is usually the end result of 
the player's role playing but it can be enhanced by the intentional decision to 
''make an entrance'' or ''make an impression''. 
To do so the character must decide whether he wishes to make a general 
attempt at establishing a presence or whether he wants to establish himself as a 
physical or mental personality of note. Remember that Albert Schwietzer had 
as much of a presence as Darth Vader. 
The actual presence roll is made at an DF-3, SB = GAW or PAW or MAW 
or any other statistic depending on the type of presence the character wishes to 
establish.

5.4 Morale 
Morale rolls are typically made when an NPC realizes that a conflict ( physical, 
Mental, or verbal ) is not going as planned. At that point, usually after a 
perception roll, the NPC has to make a morale roll. Morale rolls are SB = 
GAW, MAW, PAW.
