            <para> For a DRF (Difficulty Reduction Function) we have the stat plus skill plus
                environment minus mods. <informalequation>

                    <mathphrase>Stat + Skill + Environment + Other Mods</mathphrase>
                </informalequation> A filter skill eliminates the "Unfamiliar Environment"
                difficulty and puts an upper limit on how much of the (Stat + Skill) can be applied. <informalequation>
                    <mathphrase>Stat + Skill + Environment + Other Mods</mathphrase>
                </informalequation> The filter skill governs expression of stat + skill (how often
                is applied? What happens if someone can't make his filter roll?) </para>
            <para> The DRF goes up beyond 100% at 50+ or greater. Note that dragons have an ability
                to adapt to environment i.e. they have no need for separate filter skills) </para>
            <para>Create a table with discrete sections for each difficulty factor that has an
                impact.</para>

            <para>If we remove initiative on a roll by role basis and simply add successive mods for
                general combat and we keep initiative for detailed combat it would kick butt.</para>
            <para>DRF take two note that the DRF of alternatives is a good start but 99% is still
                too low for a certain part of the time. Each successive action cuts the base chance?
                Or simply subtracts from the DF?</para>

                <para> This chapter outlines one of the more interesting areas of SF gaming: Pyschic
                    Phenomenom or Psionics. What is to be noted is that no comfortable way could be
                    found to make a truly generic set of psionic abilities. A great deal of the
                    limitations described here are indeed implementation specific and could be
                    changed on GM's whim. </para>
                <para> Psionics is the application of mental force to directly affect an entitie's
                    surroundings. The stat PSI measures how much power the psionic can access and
                    control and skill in disciplines determines how well it can be molded to their
                    will. </para>

                                telekinetic action. Telekinetic skills are typically of medium cost,

                    that it is always easier to affect inanimate objects with Psionics. </para>
                <para> When attempting to affect other entities the percentage chance to succeed is
                    lowered by the defending entities MDF. An actively defending individual lowers
                    it by 2 * MDF. In addition, there are a number of situations (critical misses,
                    instinctively defending opponents) that could cause the psionic great pain when
                    attempting to affect a living creature. </para>

                    <title>Skill Rolls</title>

                        This concentration may be made up to three times per pulse. If more than
                        that is needed , give it up. Psionics may use special aids in concentrating

                            Meditation skill to their chance to perform the discipline. It cuts all
                            non-psi perceptions to [ 1/2] their normal chance. </para>

                        of a given psionic skill. So typically a Telekinetic can move objects at a
                        rate equal to their mental movement. </para>

                    <para> Knowledge of the body in question is a key factor. Biokinetics often have

                <title>Introduction</title>
                <para> This chapter discusses two techniques to increase the effectiveness of an
                    individual. One technique is typified by a very nebulous region of skills called
                    KI skills. </para>
                <para> The other technique is that of meditation. Meditation is the act of excludng
                    all outside disturbances from affecting your concentration. </para>
                <para> Ki skills are mental disciplines designed to augment a physical action.
                    Specifically they allow the expenditure of mental fatigue in order to increase
                    the EF of a physical skill. </para>
                <para> Requires as much time as setup to perform (This can be shortened with rank).
                    Normal setup cannot be applied to the same action. </para>

                <title>Using KI Skills</title>
                <para> All KI skills have a direct effect upon the EF of the action being fiocused
                    on. They are limited in duration to the time it takes to perform the action. The
                    actual EF of the KI skill is at a -3. </para>

                <para> This chapter details out the incredibly important rules regarding the gaining

            <sect1>
                <title>Description</title>
                <para> Research is an attempt to locate information that is already discovered but
                    not readily available. Experimentation is an attempt to discover previously
                    unknown information by using various experiments to collect data. </para>
                <para> Research is critical to many of the exploration and discovery scenarios of
                    role playing that are so easy to envision in a Space Age game. The greatest
                    problem is to determine whether or not the character has the research resources
                    to allow a relatively simple time of it. </para>

            <sect1>
                <title>Forms of Research</title>

                    <title>Retrieval Queries</title>

                <sect2>
                    <title>Inference Queries</title>
                    <para> Given information, infer something from them. This is difficult but
                        fairly straight forward. </para>

                    <title>Formulate Queries</title>
                    <para> Formulating the correct question to perform research on falls into the
                        realm of experimentation. This is the most difficult of all pieces of work.

                    <para> In most situations this is done by the PC on an ad hoc basis and treated
                        on the fly by the GM. Only in special circumstances should the GM require
                        the character to roll in order to Formulate the query. </para>

                    <title>Retrievel</title>
                    <para> Retrieval is a direct search in the appropriate database of information
                        or related DB's. Typically done with the aid of a computer if available.
