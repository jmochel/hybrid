# RPG Rules Synthesis Project

This project organizes the multi-step synthesis of a fantasy RPG rule system using Claude Opus.

## Folder Structure

- `00_sources/`: Original documents (PDF, Word, Markdown, etc.)
- `01_extracted_fragments/`: Claude Step 1 — extract mechanics from each source
- `02_clustered_by_topic/`: Claude Step 2 — group all variations of each topic
- `03_synthesized_sections/`: Claude Step 3 — merged, annotated rule sections
- `04_final_document/`: Claude Step 4 — final, structured markdown document
- `05_logs_and_notes/`: Prompts, logs, and project notes

## Workflow Steps

1. Upload each document to Claude and run Step 1 to extract relevant mechanics
2. Group and compare topic-specific content across docs (Step 2)
3. Synthesize final markdown section per topic (Step 3)
4. Assemble into one final document (Step 4)
