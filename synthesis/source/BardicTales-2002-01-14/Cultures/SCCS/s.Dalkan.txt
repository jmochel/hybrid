JimJacklM: DalKan vocabulary questions ?
DragonSoaring: Ask...
JimJacklM: Chohan, Johan, Gohan ?
DragonSoaring: Chohan
JimJacklM: And chohan command how many ?
DragonSoaring: Or rather- Cho-Han (two characters
DragonSoaring: A Cho-han can command up to 50 Samurai and up to 1000 Bushi.
DragonSoaring: But those ar ehigh end numbers.  The Dal-Kon don't usually have Big armies.
JimJacklM: Any other ranks other than Daimyo I should know about ?
DragonSoaring: A Daim-yo can have as few as three Cho-hans and as many as twenty if he is insanely powerful.  
DragonSoaring: The Daim-yo that is your host- (The p;adin of Heimdell) has 14.
DragonSoaring: I folow your lea don the question odfother ranks...
JimJacklM: Have you thought about by Shogun suggestion ?
DragonSoaring: You are the Dal-kon student right now! :-) 
JimJacklM: lol
DragonSoaring: I don't understand about YOU starting aSHogunate.
JimJacklM: no no no :-)
DragonSoaring: How would YOU have the EMporer selct you for that poosition?
JimJacklM: No I meant that I, Jim, was strating a concept called a shogun for DalKan
DragonSoaring: I like the idea- and it can be implemented as you sugessted and I am ofr their having been one or two in the past.
DragonSoaring: PLease go wild!
JimJacklM: Menahan is not Shogun material
JimJacklM: !
DragonSoaring: I give you liciense (though I of course retain editing and veto rights!) :-)
JimJacklM: what a suprise 
JimJacklM: :-
JimJacklM: :-)
DragonSoaring: My thinking was that a really big army would have 
JimJacklM: Holly is planning on giving it a very thoroough once over !

DragonSoaring: Samurai (that can control 20 - 200 Bushi)
DragonSoaring: CHo-han that can contro up to 50 Samurai and have their own 20-200 Bushi
DragonSoaring: Daim-you would have 3-20 Cho-han
DragonSoaring: Ther ewould be thirteen Daim-yos in Dalkon and one Emporer.
JimJacklM: 13 Daimyos ? 
DragonSoaring: I have mad ehtis up- itn is not becadon any research on my part except maybe memory of books I have read.
JimJacklM: Hmmm. 
DragonSoaring: Too many or too few?
JimJacklM: Daimyos act as clan heads ?
JimJacklM: To few.
DragonSoaring: Clan heads could be Daim-yos - rthere are way more Clanheads than there are Daim-yos
DragonSoaring: SOme CLanheads ar eonly Samurai.
DragonSoaring: or "only" Cho-han.
DragonSoaring: Does that make sense?
DragonSoaring: Maybe it should be 23 Daim-yos
DragonSoaring: or 30?
DragonSoaring: WHat do you think?
DragonSoaring: I haven't enumerated them yet.
JimJacklM: let me think about that. I am drastically simplifying the count from the Japanese but I have figured on 90 odd clans each with 2-7 lines answering to them.
DragonSoaring: Hmmmm...... I was thinking that there were three- four million Dalkon in the world.
DragonSoaring: What would that imply?
JimJacklM: Did daimyos result from people establishing protection over groups of other dalkan ?
DragonSoaring: Yes.
JimJacklM: that some clans are very large.
DragonSoaring: And form Emporers granting certain Dal-Kon over acrhing authority. 
JimJacklM: then there must bne some close to one to one mapping between Daimyos and regions . You have DalKna brokjen up into some damn small islands.
DragonSoaring: Hmmm.... Nod. 
JimJacklM: Why not go with the concept of lesser and greater daimyos
DragonSoaring: Well- I figur ethere are 5-10 thousand Dal-Kon in Begalli.
DragonSoaring: Maybe 2-3 thousand in TOlnia
DragonSoaring: I have no problem with greater and lesser Daimyos.  Or even if you ocme up with a mor ehistorialc accurate title for a "lesser Daimyo that is okay.
DragonSoaring: Maybe ther eare only a million Dal-Kon. 
DragonSoaring: Oh well- I hsould get bnack to work./ 
JimJacklM: ok. Tell you what. Lets assume 3-4 million for now. Also, I am assuming that DalKan is fertile but treacherous. Let me work out the numbers based on that and the land area of DalKan on the map . Does that work ?
DragonSoaring: That is fine.  I ouwld love it if you could do that !  
JimJacklM: ok
JimJacklM: done !

JimJacklM: well . Started anyway
JimJacklM: lol
JimJacklM: ttyl
