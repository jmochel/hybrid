An example of the continuing power of women in the early feudal
period is Hojo Masa-ko. This strong-willed woman seized the reins
of the shogunate after her husband, the first shogun Yoritomo
Minamoto, died in 1199. She quickly maneuvered her own family,
the Hojo clan, into a regency over her son Yoriie. In her old
age it is  she who galvanized the shogunate army which crushed
the forces of the Emperor Go-Toba in 1221. The Hojos remained
as regents over all the successive Minamoto shoguns for the next
century and a half. For this reason Hojo Masa-ko, known as "Mother
Shogun," has been referred to as the founder of the shogunate.

Over time the independent samurai woman is  replaced by an image which depicted 
the ideal samurai women as humble, obedience, self-controlled and above all 
subservient to men. Respecting one's husband and family and bearing a male child 
became this ideal woman's most important tasks. By the later feudal ages, the 
law of primogeniture prevailed as increasing disputes over property resulted in 
girls being debarred from rights to inherited property. Supporting the 
deterioration in women's position were both Confucian doctrine and Buddhism 
which denigrated women's intellectual and moral capacities. After the 15th 
century, the teachings of the "Three Obediences" reigned. "A woman has no way of 
independence through life. When she is young, she obeys her father; when she is 
married, she obeys her husband; when she is widowed, she obeys her son." 

Women and Religion: Women take an active part in the religions of early Japan. From 
ancient times women were Shinto shamans. Often a miko or a Shinto princess is 
called upon in difficult cases to try to establish the truth. After going into a 
trace and being possessed by the god, the kami would then speak though the 
miko's voice. Also, women participated equally in Japan's festivals and 
celebrations. Some, such as the festival of the Maid Star (the Tanabata 
festival), were directed principally toward women. When Buddhism first appeared 
it appealed particularly to upper-class women. The convents offered them an 
alternative to marriage and provided leadership roles through the office of 
abbess. Visits to temples offered others an escape from the confines of their 
houses. At the same time, Buddhism lessened women's status by portraying them as 
dishonest, deceitful, and neglectful of religious duties. By the 12th century 
many Japanese were adherents of Amidism. It is  felt that only Amida's grace can 
help in this age of degenerating social and political structures. Amida's appeal 
is  the idea that belief alone, and not intense self-discipline and self-power, 
can assure one's escape from the painful cycles of birth and rebirth. The Monk 
Honen claimed that by repeating the Amida name of Buddha, there would be no 
distinction between men and women nor between the mighty and the weak. Later, 
the more violent Lotus sect repudiated this; "No women are to be found in 
paradise. Women will have to first be reborn as men." Beliefs of women's 
inherent sinfulness increased as time went on. Peasant Women: The lives of 
peasant women contrasted greatly with the lives of women in the upper classes. 
Since most accounts from the period deal with the concerns of the aristocrats, 
who were only about one-tenth of one percent of Japan's population, we know very 
little of the lives of the vast majority who were commoners. We do know that 
women worked alongside men in a kind of rough equality and have some control 
over household decisions. They held some property rights, including rights of 
inheritance and divorce, although they can not remarry. In contrast to 
aristocrats, peasant women often wore their hair short and, since families 
needed their hands for labor, married late, usually to someone in their own 
village or group of villages. Farmers only takes one wife. As time went on, 
however, the later feudal age samurai ideal of the obedient, submissive woman is 
accepted by the common people and peasant women lost much of their earlier 
independence.
