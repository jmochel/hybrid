feudalism represents a necessary stage in the normal life of all human
societies. If one is inclined to be so bold as to attempt to answer this
question, it would be well for him to reflect now rarely in social history all
the complex conditions necessary for a feudal development could be found in
joint operation. Am extraordinary combination of several sets of circumstances
would seem to be required for producing each of the three characteristics of
feudalism that we have enumerated. Let us essay to examine some of these
circumstances. Again I am obliged to trouble you with a few tortuous sentences.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For the rise of feudal institutions,
(1) it is necessary that the society should have organized itself into a more
or less centralized state, and at the same time retain its memory of that older
mode of life in which kinship was the controlling bond of society; and that the
state should, for some reason, be thrown into profound unrest, utterly losing
its power to safeguard life and property by means of regular state agencies,
and men should recoil to their old habits of clan life under the new condition;
the result being a spontaneous break-up of society into small private groups of
men armed for defence and offence, and exercising within themselves all the
essential functions that had till lately belonged to the state; (2) it is
necessary that this society should definitely be in what has been termed the stage
of &quot;land economy, &quot; so that there should be, in relation to the
population, scarcity of money in circulation and abundance of land for
agricultural uses; and that this condition should be attended by a land law
that is quite inadequate to regulate man's cupidity in an age of disorder; the
natural result being the rise and prevalence, at the very centre of social
economy, of land areas and landed relations of private character; and (3) it is
necessary that the social unrest should persist during a sufficiently long<o:p></o:p></span></p>

centuries in the cases both of Europe and of Japan) to enable the private
relations to make such progressive adjustments, that finally their two sides---
namely, land and armed service--- should penetrate into each other and be

which we analyzed at the beginning.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'><span

circumstances attended the feudal formation in Europe and in Japan.<span

the fundamental characteristics and conditions that we have discussed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Having surveyed the conditions for
feudal growth, we are perhaps in a better position to consider the question
whether feudalism will come sooner or later to all societies at a certain stage
of their development. This will be one of the great problems that the future
science of social life will have to solve. In our present state of knowledge,
we ought not to presume to return a categorical answer; for, while the correct
answer should manifestly be inductive, we are still far from being enabled to
make a scientific comparison of all the historic systems of feudalism. I shall
venture merely to offer a few suggestions that seem to follow my own
understanding of the necessary conditions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If it be true that a real feudalism
could arise only at the stage of &quot;land economy,&quot; it is clear that
feudalism will not grow among a nomadic or pastoral people, for they have not
properly reached that stage. Nor could feudalism be born in a civilized
community of today, or in its colony, for it already is in the economic stage
of money and credit; moreover, the rivalry with other civilized nations and the
need of domestic security that characterize modern society have caused a
centralization of its government, while memories of clan life as the binding
principle of social organization have long since been lost. Under an imperial
regime, also, even at a stage of land economy, its central<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>ization of power
will prove an effective check against a true feudal formation. Eliminating
these societies, then, will feudalism occur in all other societies when they
come to the stage of land economy? I should answer: No, if their land law is at
all adequate; if their state power is not completely broken down under a social
unrest that shall continue for a very long period ; if the people have not
fresh memories of clan life and have not also experienced a centralized
political life ; and, finally, if all these conditions do not obtain at the
same time among an energetic race. Now, the simultaneous existence of the
memory of clan life and the experience of state politics--- which was due, in
Europe, only to an admixture of the Teutonic and Roman culture, and, in Japan,
only to the grafting of Chinese institutions upon the native--- is indicative
of the extraordinary character of the concurrent forces that are needed for the
development of a feudal system. I am inclined to think that feudal growth (like
social progress itself) is <i>not</i> normal; and is, on the whole, a fortunate
abnormality that has been the gift of a very few races in the world's history.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

question of the origins entirely untouched, partly because I have elsewhere
given a tentative view of it<sup>1</sup>, and partly because I shall have an
opportunity to discuss it more fully in. the future. Nor can I tarry to
demonstrate that, in relation to feudal origins, as well as to feudal

typical <i>sho</i> about the year 1150, for then the <i>sho</i> as an
institution bad attained its full maturity. Here we from taxation and from the
intrusion of public officials. More or less autonomous, the <i>sho</i> is under
the shadowy rule of an absent seignior, who is a court noble at Kyoto or
perhaps a great temple; his interest is in the keeping of his agent residing in
the <i>sho</i>. Under these agents range themselves in order the various
tenures of land and the classes of people who hold them. As we set about
studying the tenures and classes, however, we find them always covered under a
ubiquitous institution, called <i>shiki</i> (</span><span style='font-family:

mystifies and baffles us. After an effort, the veil is torn, the <i>shiki</i>
is exposed, and the whole life of the <i>sho</i>, with all its classes and
tenures, is revealed before us. What, then, is a <i>shiki</i>?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Suppose that you own a piece of land,
and let it to a tenant ; that he plants rice on it, and, when the harvest is
gathered, divides the crop into two parts, keeping one for himself and
rendering the other to you as rent; and that you, too, divide your share, and
give up a part to the government as a tax. Here we have a distribution between
the State, the proprietor, and the tenant, of rights and interests relative to
a single piece of land. These rights and interests may be distributed
differently, and be further divided and vested in more parties; and still they
will all be derived from the same piece of land. A <i>shiki</i> of land is a
separate right or profit derivable from it that is vested in a person--- after
whom it is named; as, for instance: the seignior- <i>shiki</i>, proprietor-<i>shiki</i>,
tenant-<i>shiki</i>, or the like.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'><span

given piece of land, it is evident that the highest in rank will be its titular
head; while, at the same time, the one whose control over the land is the most
real will be he, whatever his title and <i>shiki</i>, who actually possesses
and exploits the land. The former is the seignior, and the latter the producer;
the seignior has secured the public immunity of the <i>sho</i>, and the
producer bears ultimately all its private financial burden.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

readily divisible, detachable from land, and movable among individuals, than
tenures; for shiki were not so profits derived from land, irrespective as to whether
land was actually held or not. Tenures were primarily conditions; shiki chiefly
meant incomes. Rights, rather than obligations, were innate in the idea of
shiki. As a consequence, while the word &quot;tenure&quot; would seem inappropriate
when it was applied to the holding of the warrior-lord, the term <i>shiki</i>
was as strictly germane to the status of the seigniors as to that of the tenant
farmer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>to Europe. In
fact, it may be said that it was a kind of forced application of a similar
notion to church lands in France after the eighth century that caused the
creation of the <i>precarium</i> for the knight, which later became the <i>beneficium</i>
and the fief. But the European <i>shiki</i>, if I may use the term, seem always
to have been more closely connected with land, and never to have been so far
detached and sublimated and so freely conveyed about as in Japan. I shall have
occasion later to suggest that there was an underlying cause for this
significant difference, and that the difference produced far-reaching consequences
that made the two systems of feudalism divergent in important respects
throughout their history.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

distinguish three main divisions of tenures, according to their origins. There
are free tenures of possession which have been derived from the first
cultivation of the soil, or from purchase or other modes of out-right
acquisition, and which can therefore be bequeathed or disposed of at will, the
seignior exercising little or no interference with them.<sup>2</sup> I am not
yet certain if they all owe dues to him, but am at present inclined to think
that some of them at least do not at first. When, however, the holder of a free
land gives up the title over it to the seignior for the purpose of protection
or immunity, a second class of tenure results--- that of the commended land.
Here the seignior becomes the titular owner, but in fact is, in all the normal
cases, merely entitled to certain dues from the land, for the commendor usually
remains as its possessor and user, and continues to dispose of it as he
pleases, though<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Presumably most &quot;residents&quot; are descendants of those local
celebrities of historic families whose names abound in the older annals. Many
of these men have lived in the place for generations, control its freer tenures
of land, carry arms and keep retainers, have even served at the capital in
minor capacities, and have generally established their prestige as the leading
inhabitants of the <i>sho</i>. In their position as proprietors of land, they
are the <i>ji-shu</i> (</span><span style='font-family:"ÇlÇr ñæí©";mso-ascii-font-family:

form the backbone of the <i>sho</i>, representing its population and guarding
its interest. The seignior has perforce to depend on their good-will and
cooperation, whether in the administration of the affairs of the <i>sho</i> or
in its defense against aggression from without. In some localities, their
influence, as armed men, is even greater, for it is none other than these
&quot;residents&quot; who, under the name <i>bu-shi</i> ( </span><span

are at once interesting and characteristic. I have no time to enlarge upon the
several sources before the tenth century from which I suppose the
&quot;cultivators&quot; to have descended, or upon the manner in which I believe
&quot;landholders&quot; and &quot;cultivators&quot; to have still been, in many

and all other <i>shiki</i>, is mobile. As individuals, the &quot;cultivator
&quot; ranks below the &quot; landholder,&quot; tilling the latter's land and
paying him dues. As <i>shiki</i>, however, the cultivator-ship of a piece of
land is in theory lower than its landholder-ship, but may in reality be vested
in any person even higher than the landholder. I have seen cases of small
proprietors offering cultivator-ships to great seigniors. It is not seldom that
the same person holds the cultivator-<i>shiki</i> of several tracts together
with the landholder-<i>shiki</i> of others. And the <i>shiki</i> continually
travel and change, combine and separate.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'><span

the serf exist in the Japan of the twelfth century? I am yet unable to answer
these questions, but can only say that the scanty evidence I have met with

of territory, but a private domain which, however, has succeeded in assuming
its own financial control, and consequently winning a large degree of autonomy
both political and judicial. Nor is the <i>sho</i> divided into districts with
definite boundaries, but consists of farms scattered over rather ill defined
areas and loosely held together by a network of varied and changeable tenures.
Nor yet is the <i>sho</i> a village community: except the irrigation required
for the rice-culture, there is little in the agricultural life of the <i>sho</i>
that calls for common regulation and management; each farm is managed
independently by its holder. Neither is the <i>sho</i> a feudal domain; its
seignior is not a warrior, and his hold over its land and men is singularly
slight; he merely receives the stipulated dues from<o:p></o:p></span></p>

It is as clear as day, I repeat, that the <i>sho</i>, is not feudal; but it
paved the way for feudalism.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The <i>sho</i> of the twelfth century is
not feudal: it is neither a Manor nor a Fief. And the difference from these
European institutions gives rise to two important problems for the student of
comparative institution. The typical manor in Europe possesses features that
resemble those of a village community: its arable land is laid out in strips of
a rectangular shape and of certain regular sizes; and its cultivation, as also
the management of the meadows, pastures and woods of the manor, is under the
joint supervision of lord and tenants; and the tenants hold these strips in
tenures that are stationary, for each strip is encumbered with definite
customary services; moreover, the lower tenants are strictly tied down to their
strips and their tenures, and are forbidden to shift. The <i>sho</i>, on the contrary,
as we have seen, consists, where the ground is cultivated, of plots irregular,
not only in position, but also in shape and size, and managed independently by
their holders; and many of these holders will, so long as the seignior's fiscal
rights are not affected, dispose of their shiki as they please, and so continue
to make the tenures more intricate and changeable. If, therefore, a chief
problem of the origin of the manor concerns its elements of village community,
the first great question of the <i>sho</i> must relate to its growth as a
congeries of shifting interests and relations loosely bundled together under an
absent seignior. This is the first of the two problems to which we shall
address ourselves.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The other problem arises from the
comparison of the Japanese <i>sho</i> with the European Fief. Though both are
economic and political units that are largely autonomous, their difference in
other respects is fundamental. There is an immeasurably greater coherence in
the personal relation between the lord and his armed servitors in the fief than
between the seignior and any class of the<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>inhabitants of the <i>sho</i>. In the fief, the lord and vassal are
bound together for services of war and council, and<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>the vassal
receives his grant of land because he serves the lord, instead of serving the
lord because he receives the land. Usually, also, the lord of a fief is himself
a vassal of a higher lord; and, in the whole chain of these relative positions,
the fief or sub-fief is incapable of alienation without special sanction, for
the tenure is personal; even though the fief has by custom been made
hereditable and subinfeudable, the original personal character of the tenure is
still clearly retained in the formality of a new investiture that is repeated
at each succession. How different are conditions in a <i>sho</i>! Here the
relations between seignior and tenants are primarily fiscal, not personal; the
freer tenants are very nearly absolute owners of their holding, which are not
only divisible and inheritable, but also alienable without restraint; the lower
<i>shiki </i>of &quot;cultivation&quot; does not imply a servile status of its
holder, but is often held by a person of note and is as mobile as all other <i>shiki</i>;
even about those who are lowest in the social scale--- the laborers on the
soil--- we are not certain that they are not men privately hired for wages by
the individual holder of the &quot;cultivator &quot;-<i>shiki</i>. For a
parallel with the <i>sho</i>, one should not go to the French fief, but rather
to the Roman saltus; and even there the resemblance will be superficial. And
yet,---and this is a marvel in institutional history,--- despite all the
radical difference at the beginning, the <i>sho</i> of the twelfth century will
be seen in the fifteenth to have become, or to have been replaced by, an
institution that is charged with all the essential marks that characterize the
European fief Here, then, is our second problem : How did the <i>sho</i> become
a fief. The remainder of my lecture with be concerned chiefly with these two
great problems.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the characteristics of the <i>sho</i> that differentiate it from the Manor, we

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>pasture, and the
cultivation of rice as the chief agricultural industry.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Rice-culture is practiced in paddies
that are terraces made perfectly level, and is available only on lowlands that
can be so used and irrigated. It is, therefore, practiced only in plots that
are so small and of such irregular shapes as are determined by the lay of the
land and by the need of irrigation. What is even more important, the nature of
the industry is strongly conducive to an early development of individual
ownership of rice-land, whether by person or by family; for, as is well known,
rice-culture requires, during a considerable space of time each year, an
investment of personal labor that is more varied, intensive, and unremitting, than
do other kinds of husbandry known to early agriculture. And this tendency will
be emphasized if, for any region, rice is, as was the case in Japan at least
from the seventh century, of high economic value, and is used as the standard
of value and as the chief article in a system of taxation that has the person
or the family as a basis of its assessment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Individual ownership may, however, be
retarded even with rice-fields, if pasture is everywhere present beside them,
as seems to be the case in some parts of Java, and of ancient China; for the
interference of the community that is imperative in the use of the common
pasture and meadow will conceivably react upon the use of the rice-land as
well. I cannot help thinking that the juxtaposition of pastures and arable
lands that characterized the typical manors of Europe was a great cause for the
presence of that side of their life that resembled a village community. Without
going further into other allied circumstances which I would discuss if I had
time, I call your attention to the fact that Japan was under no special need of
having so many pastures as would enter into all communities as their integral
parts. If we now consider the various effects together, it will not be
difficult to see that Japanese rural communities before the seventh century
were not Dorfer, or, village communities, but rather Einzelhofe, or,
&quot;scattered farms,&quot; which comprised irregular plots of arable<o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>measure, fashioned after the written laws of China, of arranging the
free taxable population of Japan in artificial communities of fifty, families,
and of imposing upon it a system of equal allotment of rice-land subject to a
periodical redistribution.<sup>4</sup> Then the older native institutions of individual
ownership and &quot;scattered farms&quot; quickly reappeared around newly
tilled lands. These, under the patronage of private seigniors, absorbed land
and people from public districts, and grew with such ominous facility that
their importance threatened to outweigh that of the areas, which still remained
under the control of the state and were fast being swallowed by the new domains.
These, new domains were the <i>sho</i>. The <i>sho</i> was the old Einzelhof
revived on new grounds under new conditions. Among the new conditions that
confronted the holders of new lands were the existence of the seignior who
would tighten his control over land and men, and the social unrest and
insecurity abroad that was growing worse and that irresistibly drove the
independent landholder, in spite of themselves, to seek the protection and the
immunity of the seignior. Notwithstanding the pressure of the circumstances,
however, these men would, if they could, retain in their hands the substance,
if not the outer form, of their familiar rights over the fields. They
naturally, and perhaps unconsciously at first, in their struggle to maintain
the real possession and use of land and to secure its immunity, from public
taxation, had recourse to the division and the conveyance of detached <i>shiki</i>
of land, with the resultant looseness and flexibility of tenures and classes
that we have seen. The excessive mobility of <i>shiki</i> seems to me to
indicate behind it a great effect of the want of pasture and the prevalence of
rice-culture<o:p></o:p></span></p>

prior to her beginning in feudal formation, as to prevent the appearance of a

bear in mind if we would grasp the difference of feudalism in Japan from that
in Europe.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Having briefly dealt with one of the
two problems we set before ourselves, I now turn to the other. With what
changes can a <i>sho</i> be made over into a fief? Evidently, first, its
tenures and classes must be so simplified, rearranged, and tightened, that
there should appear distinct classes, one rendering service in arms which is
considered noble, and another or others engaged in productive labor and holding
land in tenures that are regarded as ignoble; and, secondly, the seignior or
his intendant should himself be a warrior, and the armed men of the domain
should be in direct personal relations with him. These two changes--- the
reconstruction of tenures and classes, and the advent of the military
seignior--- with the other far-reaching effects that would flow from them, made
a substantial progress in the first feudal period, known as the Kamakura, (the
late twelfth to the early fourteenth century), but was completed only in the
next period.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'><span

process as it began in the Kamakura period. From a study of documents of this
period, I am led to conclude with a degree of confidence that the seignior,
even a religious seignior, went a long way toward attaining his object to
assimilate the freer tenures with the more precarious. He now dared to
confiscate <i>shiki</i> of offending &quot;landholders&quot; and
&quot;cultivators,&quot; and grant them to others in more dependent tenures. He
also achieved similar results through awards in law suits that had been brought
before his court, and through loans and purchases in which he himself was not
seldom engaged. Even commended lands were now, in unusual instances, handed

was in general very frequent in this period, and often ended in their finally
reposing in the hands of the seignior in some title or other. Such being the
case even in religious <i>sho</i>, it may well be imagined that the freer
tenures under military seigniors or intendants must have fared worse. It is
significant that the suzerain decreed in 1270 that neither the hereditary
possessions nor the granted lands of his tenants-in-chief could be alienated
without his sanction, though still heritable and sub-in-feudable ; thirty-eight
years before, hereditary domains, as distinguished from granted holdings, had
been alienable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>At the same time, the classes of people
in the sho I find to be shifting toward a new alignment. The old
&quot;resident&quot; officials of the <i>sho</i> were gradually replaced by
agents appointed or specially despatched by the seignior, whose service was
rewarded either with grants of land or with stipends of rice or money. They
were expected to be more subservient to the seignior, and yet the inhabitants
were taught to look up to them as nobler, than the earlier local representative
chiefs. The evolution of this process is sometimes seen vividly through
documents.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I see an equally significant change in
the status of the so-called &quot;cultivators.&quot; They were becoming more
dependent as regards the seignior, pledging themselves to a faithful
performance of their duties and directly paying taxes to him (which I assume to
be a new condition); but, on the other hand, the &quot;cultivators&quot; had
been made, in relation to the &quot;landholders&quot; under whom they had in
theory held their <i>shiki</i>, more independent and secure than in the twelfth
century, for they had been brought under a more direct control of the seignior
and could not be dislodged with impunity.<span style="mso-spacerun:

&quot;cultivators&quot; had become the sole exploiters of the soil, bearing
ultimately all its fiscal burdens, and had advanced to the position where the
&quot;landholder&quot; had been. The distinction between the two was
disappearing. Below them, we again have occasional glimpses of menial laborers,
but little can be gathered of their position from the rare references that
occur.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the <i>sho</i> could be made nearly uniform, and if the tillers of the soil
could be sharply distinguished from the warriors and bound down to simple,
fixed tenures, there would result a counterpart of the fief. But the Japanese <i>sho</i>,
men under a military seignior, does not seem to have attained in the Kamakura
period even the first half of that state; only, as we have seen, a fair
beginning for progress in that general direction had been made. And it is
highly instructive to reflect that this progress had at once been facilitated
to that point and was restrained from going further by that characteristic
Japanese institution, <i>shiki</i>. For its flexibility at the same time helped
the seignior in his interference with the freer tenures, and also aided the
possessor of land to cling to his last right of usufruct when all other <i>shiki

seem clear:---(1) That for the completion of the organization of the fief,
something was needed that should be sufficiently strong to break down the
subtilty of the <i>shiki</i>; and (2) that, even if that should take place, the
historic proprietary right in Japan over land might be expected to hold its
own. The divided <i>shiki</i> might largely be obliterated, but would hardly be

fourteenth century, Japan entered upon the dark ages of a protracted civil war
that, with interruptions, lasted till the end of the sixteenth. Amid the utmost
decentralization that ensued, the period witnessed certain momentous changes
taking place as if by concert in the institutional life of the whole country.
Among these the most important for our present study are three parallel
processes--- two of them begun more or less in the earlier period, but the one
completely and the other nearly finished in this period; and a third begun only
now but matured after 1600.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'><span

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial'>but the results
stand out in bold outlines. We may well say that the governmental machinery was
at length completely feudalized when, as we find in 1600, most of the <i>sho</i>
under civil control and till the public offices of civil origin in the
provinces had been seized by groups of warriors held together by personal ties
of vassalage. Similarly, it is just to say that land-tenure was finally
feudalized when the conquering war-lord assumed a free disposition of the
domains he had won at the point of his sword, and without scruple reduced the
multiple tenures of the military tenants that he found therein into a nearly
uniform tenure--- a tenure which, though normally capable of heredity and
subinfeudation, was, under his dictatorial control, subject to a re-investiture
at succession and liable to confiscation for an offence, and entailed upon its
tenants definite personal services toward him. The peculiarly loose and complex
<i>sho</i>, such as we found in the twelfth century, was no more, at least
under military control: the average <i>sho</i> had, to all intents and
purposes, been converted into a veritable fief.<sup>6</sup><o:p></o:p></span></p>

transformation practically accomplished; it witnessed another movement
continued but not completed. That was a growing differentiation of the military
from the agricultural class. It will be remembered that a tendency in that
direction was already perceptible in the Kamakura period. The process was
greatly accelerated during the next centuries of incessant civil strife. The
use of the sword as the chief weapon, and then of the spear, bad caused
tactical operations to be somewhat more extended than before; but under the
impact of the terrific struggle for ascendancy among the leaders of this age,
followed by the introduction of gun-powder about 1542, organized tactics in
Japan made sudden and great progress. Warriors had become professional, and now
tended to reside near their lords' castles, instead of squatting as before in
poorly defensible mansions in their small rural domains; the service they
offered was in an increasing number of cases rewarded, not with land, but with
rice or money; not with fiefs, but with stipends. A growing separation of arms
from land was a natural consequence. This left the peasants on the fields at
once less protected, because more exposed and unarmed, and freer in status and
in feeling, because more independent of immediate military control, than
before. Nothing better illustrates the changed position of the peasantry of
this period than the interesting history of the term <i>hyaku-sho</i> (</span><span

third movement of the age, which, in fact, he embraced and nursed. I refer to

congenial to the spirit of the age; as the lord reduced his vassals' tenures to
mere grants in fee, so the peasants showed a decided tendency to regard <i>shiki</i>

to all the changes that I have noted but one. In the feudalization of
government, in the formation of the fief, and in the comparative simplicity and
fixity of tenures, the student of the one system will find in the other,
institutions so familiar as to seem almost disconcerting. But the relative
freedom of the Japanese peasant strikes a strange note that does not chime with
the Western system. How can we account for this difference? The time is
approaching that I must close. Remember, at one end, the comparative security
of the proprietary right of rice-land that had characterized Japanese
agriculture throughout the historic ages, and, at the other end, the relatively
late and sudden progress in organized tactics, in the sixteenth century that
cleared the fields of the squatting warriors. I leave you to fill in the
intermediate gap between these two ends of the process.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The third and last period of Japan's
feudal history, 1600-1868, may be dismissed with a few words. Remember the main
currents of the institutional movements of the past ages: the consolidation of
land with landed interest already begun, the separation of land and arms almost
accomplished, and the complete feudalization of land-tenure and of local
government, A little reflection will show that no regime would remain purely
feudal, if its peasants were too free and if too many of its warrior were
detached from land; the same forces that had carried to its consummation the
feudal organization of Japan, had also created conditions subversive of it. And
yet the new rulers of the seventeenth century fully admitted these tendencies,
and made them the foundation of the remarkable government that they elaborated.
Having at last unified all Japan torn for centuries by civil war, the Tokugawa
suzerain was concerned more with the problem how to preserve the peace and
power he had earned, than with the question how to make his regime purely
feudal; it was, in fact, certain that peace and power could not be maintained
if the regime were forced back to feudalism. He, therefore, frankly extended to
his rule of the<o:p></o:p></span></p>

principles of feudal government and feudal land-tenure that had developed
separately in its parts: he regarded the entire realm as a vast domain, as it
were, with its control centralized as far as was practicable in his council at
Edo ; and carved four-fifths of the total area into some three hundred
feudatories, many of them arbitrarily, and assigned them, under the name han,
to as many barons, as fief held of him, with the familiar forms of fealty and
re-investiture. In the remaining fifth, which the suzerain retained as his own
domain, his policies, both about the warrior and about peasant classes, were,
if anything, even more pragmatic. As regards the warriors, he deliberately
increased the proportion of landless stipendiaries. As for the peasantry, he,
on the one hand, gave a generous measure of self-government to its communities,
and, on the other, treated the modest land holdings of the peasants as definite
unitary possessions, and as such safeguarded them with great care, keeping the
rural population in a state of mild contentment and fairly equalized poverty.<sup>9</sup>
And the example was largely copied by the barons in their respective fiefs. The
result was a regime in which were combined and balanced with unusual skill both
feudal and non-feudal elements of society, and centralizing and decentralizing
tendencies and forces of government. The system was, of course, no longer
purely feudal, either on the whole or in its parts, either in its warrior class
or in its peasantry.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
