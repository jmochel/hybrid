>Is there any evidence to indicate that this library will indicate points of
>weakness of the Wizard King?

>>No evidence that this library will specifically point to a weakness of the 
>>Wizard King.

Absolutley correct- and it is a long way out of your way.

>Is Ice Magic (whatever that may be) particularly effective >against 
necromancy?

Ummm... probably not ( I don't mean to be negative- just saying what is so). 
Despite the APPARENT alliance between Jaric Firelord and the Wizard-King, fire 
and heat are actually much more dangerous to the forces of DEATH. Cold tends 
to be axssociated with DEATH actually. Though WATER is associated with LIFE. 
CAn ya' believe it!? ;-)

>Do we know of wrongs to be righted at the library?

Ummm... The Group(TM){KIlosrana, Raec, Wei_Lee, Maeve, John MEndore, etc.} 
would think so!;-) But I don't think you guys would think so...

>>Will this help us find out more of CatBird's or Sigmund's pasts?

Probably not.

>>However, the reference to an Ice mage could refer to the >>missing member of 
the Grey wanderers, the Ice Wolf.

Possible...

>>We do know that as a Major library it could be of some assistance to the 
>>Mages of the party in becoming better prepared for the future and because of
>>the alteration books could have information regarding Sigmund or Catbird.

This is very true actually. I hadn't considered the ALteration library- or what's left of it after Kilsorana "helped" her master fatally miscast in his study...
That could provide very useful information....


Go not to Alex for advice as he is REAL busy...

But... real quick->

> First off how do the two races view H-Elf/G-Elf crossbreeds.

G: Unpure. Not like alepoer- just a diluted person.... H: Brethren

>What is the normal hierarchy of the two. Does a HE automatically 
>acknowledge a GE's superior knowledge ? Does a GE normally look down on 
>HEs ?

Automatically? No, none of these statements ar eabsolutley true, 
but they usually are. There are militant High Elven groups that 
directly oppose Grey Elven supremacy(jut by coincidence one 
such is the Green!)

>How do the HEs relate to the BIG C ? Are they also a part of the group 
>spirit ?

Some are , some aren't it depends on how much of COrrellan's 
essence is taken away by the LIFE element.

>How do the priests of Sylvanus and BIG C deal with each other ?

Ummm-- that is a complicate dquestion. During the run roll a 
theology roll and I might be able to answer that for you. Is not simple!

>Is Sylvanus an Avatar ?

No. Yes. MAybe. According to who? In truth no- you would not consider 
him an avatar.

>What would Mord. expect in terms of treatment in the court of Taliesin 
>? Are there likely toi me many who are of my power level ? Would it be 
>common for an off plane GE to just walk in ?

No- there are likely to be only a half-dozen of your power level- maybe less.
Including Taliesin....

>By what right does Tal. rule ? Election, consensus, divine right ?

Yes. He is a PRince because He is a Prince. It happened and thus it 
happened due to the combined will of the elven peoplee... and thus 
COrrellan.

>Am I bound to obey him ?

Umm.. no. But he is a Prince- and what that means is he is a purer 
expression of COrrellan's will than you are- at least at the most basic 
level.




OK Alex,
Rules and World questions:

[1] What are the sorceries associated with Will Working ?

[2] What are the Minuses involved in using an unranked sorcery ? I vaguely remember mods for being unranked in a skill but I can't remember.

[3] When using a sorcery off of Magical Aptitude rather than skill and SCF do you add in the modifiers for the school that sorcery is in ?

[4] In general I am missing a lot of difficulty mods and ranges and times for the sorceries. This is a pain, plus the speeds must have changed when you went over to the new number of counts. I especially need the elemntal sorcery speeds and ranges and durations. Can you print out an updated copy of the Elven Sorcery Sheet or email me an ASCII dump of it ?

[5] Can someone cast a attack spell that does not require a targeting component ? i.e. It is dependent on the caster for the actaul aiming of the attack and does not "lock-on" to its target. The end result (I surmise) would be an effectively lowered magical defense for the target, a roll to-hit by the caster, and a different sort of interaction with wards triggered by a magical attack (I haven't figured out exactly what would be different).

[6] How difficult are limited foreseeings for the interaction between yourself and someone elses weapon ? I would like a 30-40 count warning of when and where an opponents weapon will be ....

Confusion to your enemies,



>The Church of Corellion is broken into three branches: The Sword, The >Word, and The Light. I roughly translate iot as the ARm, The Law, and the >Magic.


That is correct.

>Now Mordanith was raised by parents who were priests of the Word and the >Light. (I can't remember which parent did what.)

I believe father- Word, Mother - light. I could be mistaken though!


>Mordanith has
> A Theology Skill (4.6)
> A Priestly Lore Skill (5.0)
> A SDA Skill
> A Blessing Skill
>
>ARe there any others skills that form the foundation of a priest of the >Light ?

Yes- MAgic Lore. But you have that too I think! You need anSDA of at least


2.0 before you will be considered a true prioest of ZCorrellan.

>Is the worship of Corlellion and Labelas a distinctly seperate enterprise >or 
                is it a worship one get the rest free gambit ?

EVERYONE worships COrrellan- it is not like a free will issue(though I am sure

SUsan/Catbird and Morphus/Chris would think so)- it is just that Correllan is 
                the Elves. Not giving power to him is like cutting your 
                wrists.

That is why the drow are mad! They cut out the COrrellan part of themselves 
and replaced it with ... darkness!

SOme people focus their will through Labelas- not all do. Ther are no 
requirements around that. But almost all but the most majorist majorisdt of DI 
is donethorugh the Avatars... not through Correllan.


>Is there a distinct point at which Mordanith may legitimately call himself >a 
priest of the Word or the Light ?

When you have the qualifications(see above).... you can start calling yourself 
that. The ries no protocal or organization. You will occasionally be asked 
hard questions. If you are a dope you will be considered a liar for calling
yourself a priest.
