Shapeshifters	Time: 12:08 PM	Date:9/14/92
Based on our informal scheduling during the party Saturday night, I 
am sending this reminder to those of you who may need to doublecheck 
your calendars. The date in question is Thursday night October 15th. 1) 
Time?
2) Place?
3) Agenda?
I have some roleplaying loose ends that I would like to get out of 
the way, some spells, and get some numbers for training. I assume we did 
eeps after the last session, 'cause if we didn't, I don't remember enough 
to do them now. It has been long enough that I think playing on the 
15th will make the run on the 24th more enjoyable.
By the way, time and place on the 24th?
I know that the city is easiest for everyone, but keep in mind that 
my place is always available.

Subject: Re: Kilsorana



K. has contributed three spells of note- two of which were lost with 
her. 


One was her Web spell- it is a trapping spell of serious kick butt 
power- she once stopped a cavalry charge cold with one cast of it....THis 
can be reconstructed form work she did at the Seeing Eye Monastary on 
the SOuthern shore of the Immyrl Sea

One was her transmute element spell- allowed for the actually 
alteration of one elwement into another. It is unknown how she achieved this 
but she was witnessed
performing it at least twice- long, slow ritual. 

The othe rlost spell was a very powerful trigger spell that altered 
the nature 

of the item the bound spell was cast in to release the spell- very 
subtle becaus eit does not look like a trigger becaus eit is not the 
correct form and 

purity of material until it is transformed.... 

You know she was known to Krell and she has a reputation for being 
rude and brash
and very cold to other mages.

Hi- this is a test of my new Shape SHifter's alias- let me know if it 
works. I included Jane because of her enthusiastic interest!;-)

>Is there any evidence to indicate that this library will indicate

>>No evidence that this library will specifically point to a weakness 
of the >>Wizard King.

Absolutley correct- and it is a long way out of your way. 

>Is Ice Magic (whatever that may be) particularly effective >against 
necromancy?

Ummm... probably not ( I don't mean to be negative- just saying what 
is so). Despite
the APPARENT alliance between Jaric Firelord and the Wizard-King, 
fire and heat
are actually much more dangerous to the forces of DEATH. Cold tends 
to be axssociated with DEATH actually. Though WATER is associated with 
LIFE. CAn ya'
believe it!? ;-)

>Do we know of wrongs to be righted at the library? 

Ummm... The Group(TM){KIlosrana, Raec, Wei_Lee, Maeve, John MEndore, 
etc.} would
think so!;-) But I don't think you guys would think so... 

>>Will this help us find out more of CatBird's or Sigmund's pasts? 

Probably not.

>>However, the reference to an Ice mage could refer to the >>missing 
member of the Grey wanderers, the Ice Wolf. 

Possible...

>>We do know that as a Major library it could be of some assistance 
to the >>Mages of the party in becoming better prepared for the future 
and because of 

>>the alteration books could have information regarding Sigmund or 
Catbird. 

This is very true actually. I hadn't considered the ALteration 
library- or what's left of it after Kilsorana "helped" her master fatally 
miscast in his study...
That could provide very useful information....

DIffenrent groups her epeople-

Jim is thinking of the political institution that is indeed primarily 
High Elves and may or MAY NOT have a beef with Kheldar. Mordanith isn't 
savvy enough on High Elven politics to know. 


Morphus is thinking of the Sea Elves. The legendary race of Elves

change basic nature. They swapped water where Air now is in the FAer-han. 

Most Grey Elves were revolted at this and their is often conflict .. 
most of the experimantal subjects died- but some lived and bred true. 

The "Green Elves" are a bastard sub-race of the Sea Elves that result 
from sea elven and wood elven cross breeding. Kilscarana Moonmist was one 
of these half-breeds. They almost never survive pregnancy and they are 
considwered very rare by the elves- Which, BTW, makes them unbeleivably rare! ~

Kilscarana's "people" are the Sea Elves. They are much like Grey 
Elves- haughty aristocratic, they believe themselves to be superior, the 
"next model up" in evolution. They are tres powerful magically and 
dnagerous, but they are bound to the water as Grey Elvesare bound to the air... 
Green Elves can usually do both!!!!

I don't think that there is any way that Morphus would have anything 
in common with Lara's character. I thought that the "Green Elves" that 
Lara was talking about were the same as the "Green Elves" that Alex had 
mentioned before. After reading the message from Alex (see below) I realize 
that the only group that Morphus probably would have had relations with 
would have been the High Elven hit squad or whatever they were. Lara, if 
Morphus ever hears about your situation, it will interest him enough to try 
to bring you back, but I have to hear about you first. Sorry.

About: Ice Mage Detour

(Please forward to rest of Shifters)

Is there any evidence to indicate that this library will indicate 
points of weakness of the Wizard King? Is Ice Magic (whatever that may be) 
particularly effective against necromancy? Do we know of wrongs to be righted at 
the library? Will this help us find out more of CatBird's or Sigmund's 
pasts?

Sure. Go for it. Knowledge is seldom wasted. 

On another note, is there anyone who does not have an Ironcloth 
garment and would like one? I have worked out a few ideas about some of the 
party.

Arak-	Tunic; garnet, with obsidian trim.
Leggings; obsidian.
Possible Symbol of Arioch on it (raised weave). Possibly have Arak 
help with creation, add power. 

Erithmaeon-Robe; white opal.
Very well woven, suitable for advertising. No "loose ends" to 
interfere with other weavings. 

Mordenith- Robe; star sapphire.
Able to get along with Cloak.
Very resistant to high power flows.
Possibly have Mordenith help with creation, attune. 

Sigmund-	Toga; smoky quartz.
Very resistant to high levels of Earth magic. Able to survive the 
"Sigmund plane."

CatBird-	Tunic; tigereye, very silk-like, loose.
Pants; dark citrine (brown), tougher weave, tighter. Both designed to 
"stretch" as she grows. 

I have listed them in order of difficulty, should probably be woven 
in roughly that order, so I will have higher skill levels for the 
trickier ones.

-Myth.


--------------------------------------
No evidence that this library will specifically point to a weakness 
of the Wizard King. However, the reference to an Ice mage could refer 
to the missing member of the Grey wanderers, the Ice Wolf. We do know 
that as a Major library it could be of some assistance to the Mages of 
the party in becoming better prepared for the future and because of the 
alteration books could have information regarding Sigmund or Catbird. Chris

Get a load of this folks...Here I (Morphus) am pumping Alex for 
information regarding a minor diversion (OK Alex, maybe recreating someone who 
has been un-made by contact with the VOID is a little more than a 
diversion) and I come upon a referance that could be valuable to us. See the 
section on Ice Mage...I think that this library is worth talking about as a 
possible destination after our current one - depending on the distance that 
is.

It is VERY North and a little tiny bit East of Marden. It is a litlte 
North and a little West of Dao-SHau.


> Is it only a divinitory library?

Oh no- there are ten major mages there - it is a divination library, 
a massive alteration library(surprise), a magic item creating library, 
a linguistics library, and some weird assorted books collected by one 
of the mages who is an "Ice Mage" whatever that means...

Kilsorana that Mordanith is aware of. Just in from the Jackl press.

K. has contributed three spells of note- two of which were lost with 
her. 


One was her Web spell- it is a trapping spell of serious kick butt 
power- she once stopped a cavalry charge cold with one cast of it....THis 
can be reconstructed form work she did at the Seeing Eye Monastary on 
the SOuthern shore of the Immyrl Sea

One was her transmute element spell- allowed for the actually 
alteration of one elwement into another. It is unknown how she achieved this 
but she was witnessed performing it at least twice- long, slow ritual. 

The othe rlost spell was a very powerful trigger spell that altered 
the nature 
of the item the bound spell was cast in to release the spell- very 
subtle because it does not look like a trigger because it is not the 
correct form and purity of material until it is transformed.... 

You know she was known to Krell and she has a reputation for being 
rude and brash and very cold to other mages.

Subject: Exhaustion on a battlecat


In answer to Chris' logical but esoteric question about the amount of 
exhaustion used riding as battle cat the answer is: A LOT. NO, just kidding. 
BUt it is three times as exhausting as riding a Gurka. (They are good 
for something. A good ride. No joke, please!) 

COSTS:
Walking		6 EXT per hour
Cat		3 Ext per hour
Horse		2 Ext per hour
GUrka		1 Ext per hour

Go not to Alex for advice as he is REAL busy... 

But... real quick->

G: Unpure. Not like alepoer- just a diluted person.... H: Brethren

>What is the normal hierarchy of the two. Does a HE automatically

Automatically? No, none of these statements ar eabsolutley true, but 
they usually are. There are militant High Elven groups that directly 
oppose Grey Elven supremacy(jut by coincidence one such is the Green!) 

>How do the HEs relate to the BIG C ? Are they also a part of the 
group >spirit ?

Some are , some aren't it depends on how much of COrrellan's essence 
is taken away by the LIFE element.

>How do the priests of Sylvanus and BIG C deal with each other ? 

Ummm-- that is a complicate dquestion. During the run roll a theology 
roll and I might be able to answer that for you. Is not simple! 

>Is Sylvanus an Avatar ?

No. Yes. MAybe. According to who? In truth no- you would not consider 
him an avatar.

>What would Mord. expect in terms of treatment in the court of

No- there are likely to be only a half-dozen of your power level- 
maybe less. 

Including Taliesin....

>By what right does Tal. rule ? Election, consensus, divine right ? 

Yes. He is a PRince because He is a Prince. It happened and thus it 
happened due to the combined will of the elven peoplee... and thus COrrellan.

>Am I bound to obey him ?

Umm.. no. But he is a Prince- and what that means is he is a purer 
expression of COrrellan's will than you are- at least at the most basic level.


Nuff said....

Sorry about that last. I screwed up the editor.

Clearly the only choice for me. ;-) Did you mean actual *cat*?

handling.

I meant money management like managers of mutual funds. You know, 
shepharding money. Investing. I'd be happy to call it money handling. I also 
desperately need a better cipher skill.

What is Kilsorana's Web and who is Kilsorana? (Alex, my K-Memory is 
5.5 and my INF is 16; have I heard of this Kilsorana before?) Morphus

-------------------------------
I am sure that we could do such but I am relunctant to divert my 
energies away from the Time Hammer (tm) . I would suggest that we either find 
a spell like Kilsorana's Web spell or find a mage like Kilsorana, aid 
them in such a way that they are indebted to us and have them handle the 
fighetr types. Is that what you were thinking of ? ;-).

Mordanith, I have been thinking about the impending conflict with the 
Wizard King. Even though dealing with the troops will be the primary 
concern of someone else, we should still be prepared to deal with them if 
the need arises. Have you ever encountered or are you aware of a spell 
capable of neutralizing a large number of beings at one time (without 
seriously damaging 

the surrounding landscape - which could include us)?

Subject: Why we are with Morphus

OK,
Let us talk about Morphus/Kheldar. First off let us discuss his 
general stances on topics. You seem to be saying that Morphus/Kheldar is 
neutral towards Faer-Han. Interesting statement that. Keeping in mind that 
almost all
Faer-Han and Quentar I have met have warned Mordanith about Kheldar. 
This warning usdually refers to Kheldar as an enemy of the Elves, rather 
than a neutral party. The best recommendation I recieved from an elf 
about Kheldar came from Anthea, the healer that never wants to see you 
again. 

It is clear that Kheldar was not neutral towards Elves. In some way 
he felt that he had some reason to believe that there would be 
hostilities between himself and Elves. Why else would the wards he had designed 
automatically designate a Faer-Han as a hostile target ? 

Kheldar has always been ruthless. He used people. Remember the 
K-memory about the argument between you and Falstaff regarding Tyriontil ! 
You may have met someone who has good memories about him. Mordanith has 
not. Even Falstaff, your ex-partner, has stated that you were a bit 
extreme. Come on,
we are talking about a man who designs specialized mage-assassins 
like Sigmund and (maybe) CatBird.

Mordanith has no real fears for himself at this time. He is worried 
about the lives of those to whom he stands beholden in wone way or 
another. CatBird and the Singing Warrior especially. As well you keep harping 
on the qualities of your enemies, they are Dark, they are Evil, etc... 
Yes, it is true, most of them are not people Mordanith would align 
themselves with. That doesn't matter. What does matter is that they are 
incredibly numerous ! The Dissenta, the Black Cloud, A Number of Tolnian 
Priesthoods, these are people who would try and kill you because you are an 
Abjurationist. The Dissenta, The Wizard King, and the Lich, these are people who 
would kill you because you are who you are. Oops, I forgot, add the 
priests of Archon and Archon himself. Jarek Firelord want's to kill you just 
because you pissed him off. And then there are those we are not sure about. 
Prince Taliesien and the Elves of Heimdella, THe Heimdellian Church, Kay, 
Others of the GRay Wanderers, the MAge Guild if your profile gets to high 
for them to ignore, the GodKing of Theridden, etc.. 

You, as Khel;dar, have walked this earth before. You stepped on a few 
toes ! The problem is with don't know who's toes they are ! I give the 
same advice that Falstaff gave you, that Anthea gave you, that Oleander 
gave you, that the Priest of Dal Pan gave you, etc.. and you will 
probably igniore it as you have ignored it from them: "Keep to the Cover", 
"Show yourself only when necessary!". Whenever possible, use stealth, you 
humans are said to be good at it.

As for whether you can trust me. I will stay with you, in common 
cause, until such time as the Wizard King is defeated. There are things 
normally left unsaid, that should be stated now, especially to one such as 
yourself. To one whose honor, obligations, and responsibilities may be 
sacrificed on the altar of expediency I say : "I will stay with you in common 
cause as agreed until such time as we have reached our goal, or until your 
actions cause injury to the honor or body of those innocent". 

Morphus, I am fond of you, and for this as much as anything else I 
travel with you. But I am not blind. I am along to protect others as much 
as I protect you. I continue to travel with you despite the intimations 
of others , who have dealt with you as Kheldar, that you will likely be 
the cause of my death. Do not speak to me of whom can trust who, old 
man. I will not be the one who puts your life second to that of some 
random goal ! This plane is only worth saving becuase of those who walk it. 
Otherwise, it has no intrinsic value. Try, I say to you as Falstaff has, to 
remember what you want to preserve and why.

Mordanith Alda'an Kaerlin Thalionsaer, Body Son of Ardana'al and 
Q'aelinah , Spirit Son of Corellan.

Alex:
	My notes are not what they might be (they never are) but what I have 
is the following:

	I have spread the questions around. I asked (Pallus?) the diviner 
various questions about what I am. I still have an outstanding debt with 
him. I need to have Morphus and Mordanith speak to him. (I figured that 
this would not be a hardship for them.) 

	I asked Endir, the researcher for the theive's guild about Tev and 
the rainbow people's monastery.
You told me that I knew the following:

	They wear rainbow robes with green hoods. (Just so they can 		be 
inconspicuous in Marden, right? ;-) 	They are a suicide cult. They have some 
(perhaps mostly) 		mages. When they show up, I have the impression from 		
what you said, that violence typically happens. 	When they show, I leave.
	I know where their temple in Marden is. 	
I don't know if the following is player knowledge or CB knowledge: 

	Morphus appears to have started this cult. 

About Tev:

	From the memory run:

	I remember sitting in the monastery, and Tev throwing a knife 		
repeatedly into a target.
	Tev is wearing the rainbow robes.
	My protector, a blond, bright-eyed man who is not my father, is 		
killed by a black-shafted arrow with red fletching. 		Tev throws a knife 
near me.
	I have the impression of fear and (now) anger at Tev. 

	Elsewhere:

	I think the name Tev rang a bell with the researcher. 

I made these requests (ha!) under the guise of deep-background for a 
potential job. We have not discussed payment, but I am willing to pay for 
additional time, should he find something worth pursuing. 


Jim, Chris, if you have anything to add that I might have missed, 
please feel free.

Thanks,
S

OK Alex,
Rules and World questions:

[1] What are the sorceries associated with Will Working ? 

[2] What are the Minuses involved in using an unranked sorcery ? I 
vaguely remember mods for being unranked in a skill but I can't remember. 

[3] When using a sorcery off of Magical Aptitude rather than skill 
and SCF do you add in the modifiers for the school that sorcery is in ? 

[4] In general I am missing a lot of difficulty mods and ranges and 
times for the sorceries. This is a pain, plus the speeds must have changed 
when you went over to the new number of counts. I especially need the 
elemntal sorcery speeds and ranges and durations. Can you print out an 
updated copy of the Elven Sorcery Sheet or email me an ASCII dump of it ? 

[5] Can someone cast a attack spell that does not require a targeting 
component ? i.e. It is dependent on the caster for the actaul aiming of the 
attack and does not "lock-on" to its target. The end result (I surmise) 
would be an effectively lowered magical defense for the target, a roll 
to-hit by the caster, and a different sort of interaction with wards 
triggered by a magical attack (I haven't figured out exactly what would be 
different).

[6] How difficult are limited foreseeings for the interaction between 
yourself and someone elses weapon ? I would like a 30-40 count warning of 
when and where an opponents weapon will be .... 

Confusion to your enemies,

Jim

Oh- THOSE books! The book you brought with you: 

	Standard Church Wards:Design and Implementation 		-a very useful 
guide to fixed ward preparation. But is 		very high level and is more of 
an overview than a beginner's 		guide(which is no prob.. for Mordanith) 
History of The Seven Sorceries
		-this is clear. No eye-witness accounts. All taken from 		other 
sources.
Tolnedran Runes
		-This is a high-level dictionary/lexicon designed to allow 		the 
user to learn single runs or specific types or groups 		of runes at a 
time.
	Pattern Stacking: Minimizing Interference 		-obvious(is referring to 
Ritual patterns laid down on top of 		one another..)
	Object Fixing and Cleansing for Mobile Wards 		-obvious
	The Song of Hope
		-a set of religious poems written at the end of the 		Dwarven-Elven 
War cycle.
	The Highest Hill
		-a story of the human movement to destroy abjuration 		and the 
flight of the high elves from persecution 	Enchanting an Item: A Beginner's 
Source Book 		-obvious- but not that useful on Prime. I slanted to the 		
Elven environment. Does contain useful basic principles. 	To Light the Way
		-a poem of instruction in the forming of light magics. It was 		
written by the Bard Halienthiel Akkentis Paramar. 	Words on Truth: A 
Devotional Aid.
		-a Theological guide to the Church of COrrellan. Contains a mixture 		
of philosophy,ethis, and history. Written by a high priest of 		the 
Word.

>The Church of Corellion is broken into three branches: The Sword,

and the >Magic.


That is correct.

>Now Mordanith was raised by parents who were priests of the Word and 
the >Light. (I can't remember which parent did what.) 

I believe father- Word, Mother - light. I could be mistaken though! 


>Mordanith has

> A Priestly Lore Skill (5.0)
> A SDA Skill
> A Blessing Skill
>
>ARe there any others skills that form the foundation of a priest of

Yes- MAgic Lore. But you have that too I think! You need anSDA of at 
least 


2.0 before you will be considered a true prioest of ZCorrellan. 

Requirements for all branches:
Theology: 4.0
Priestly Lore: 4.0
SDA(rarely Correllan, usually one of the avatars{e.g.Labelas}): 2.0 
DVF perception:	2.0

FOr Sword:
Sword:4.0
Parry: 4.0
PCF PErception: 4.0
Enhance PEN: 2.0

FOr Light:
ENhance MEN: 2.0
Mental SHield: 4.0
Warding: 4.0
SCF PErception 4.0

FOr Word:
Teaching: 4.0
INF PErception: 2.0
IPA	2.0
Pyschology 2.0
Augury 2.0

>Is the worship of Corlellion and Labelas a distinctly seperate 
enterprise >or is it a worship one get the rest free gambit ? 

EVERYONE worships COrrellan- it is not like a free will issue(though 
I am sure 

SUsan/Catbird and Morphus/Chris would think so)- it is just that 
Correllan is the Elves. Not giving power to him is like cutting your wrists. 

That is why the drow are mad! They cut out the COrrellan part of 
themselves and
replaced it with ... darkness!

SOme people focus their will through Labelas- not all do. Ther are no 
requirements around that. But almost all but the most majorist majorisdt of DI
is donethorugh the Avatars... not through Correllan. 


>Is there a distinct point at which Mordanith may legitimately call 
himself >a priest of the Word or the Light ?

When you have the qualifications(see above).... you can start calling 
yourself 

that. The ries no protocal or organization. You will occasionally be 
asked 

hard questions. If you are a dope you will be considered a liar for 
calling 


yourself a priest.

I am sure that we could do such but I am relunctant to divert my 
energies away from the Time Hammer (tm) . I would suggest that we either find 
a spell like Kilsorana's Web spell or find a mage like Kilsorana, aid 
them in such a way that they are indebted to us and have them handle the 
fighetr types. Is that what you were thinking of ? ;-).

Mordanith, I have been thinking about the impending conflict with the 
Wizard King. Even though dealing with the troops will be the primary 
concern of someone else, we should still be prepared to deal with them if 
the need arises. Have you ever encountered or are you aware of a spell 
capable of neutralizing a large number of beings at one time (without 
seriously damaging the surrounding landscape - which could include us)?

MOrdanith knows of her as the Green Elven Mage that was involved in 
the defeat of the Raver Oleanth. She was "lost" during the battle. She 
was said to be bad tempered and quixotic at best.

She traveled with a skilled monk named Way-li.

	Alex: How old was I in that memory run? (An infant?, Mobile? 		
Verbal? Older, maybe 4-5-6?)

	Other questions:

	Any information on his associations, political, employment, 		
religious? Are there groups he *will* not work with? 		Does he have any 
particular allies/enemies? 		Sympathies? Is he completely mercenary? 

	Where does he live? Personal habits? When/where does he go 		(you 
said he comes to the market every week) for info? 



	Alex: I give the kid a couple of silvers (or whatever's a generous 
tip in Marden.) I pass the questions on. I am willing to pay for 
additional followup. I respond to the kid's comment about not hitting Tev, with 
something to the effect that this is only a remote possibility, and its good 
to have as much info as possible. 

	In case it is not clear, I am trying to make a reputation in the 
guild as being generous with those who help me. Time may come when I have 
to do the flip side of that, but right now, I am trying to do the ally 
thing. I very much want to build up an info network. 



"How much?"	Catbird: "How much'ya got?"


Thanks,
S

NOTE: If you can't understand that is fine- I am going to try and 
give a feel 

of Marden street slang without going _CLockwork Orange_ on you... If 
you have any interpretation questions- SUsan can ask. The rest of you 
will have to ask Catbird!;-)

First report comes from a young street messenger for the Guild.. 

"Haven't learned much but I think this guy is a wig? Yaknow? Tev... 

"There was guy wit da name Tev that wa sin the Monastary of the 
Flaming Heart 


you know- the biggun in the middle of Faith Square? He was, ummm.. 
different. 

FOr one thing- he was a lifa. Heh! I guess they all are lifas there! 
HAHAHAAH! umm.. right. Well- he seemed to be sticking around. He showed up 
about 10 years ago or so- maybe 9 or 1. Hard to say unless you a looker, 
yaknow? So- he been around since then. He's in bad with the Imps 'cause 'e 
was involved in that big 'sanation that happed over at Temple Street by 
the Dragon Temp by the Gardens- yaknow? But the local jakes don't .
mess wit 'im.

"I got a name-- Tevarion Marsakanis. Pretty glitter, huh? If he's da 
same guy as dis Tev, and da dr- ma source- near da temple thinks so. He's 
trouble. He's knife in a big way. Some knocker for a big G.O. in the Blue 
Star district. I think the G.O. was in the mind-muck biz. Yaknow-with 
drugs. 


"If you gonna hit dis guy- I would watch out. He is still shakin' but 
he don't live in da monastary no more. Dey might no more about where he 
is. He shows up every week or so at the market looking for info... 

"I got told you can get one level o' followup for free. Don' know why 
you rate,
but what do you wanna know... "

(GM note: Susan- let me know ASAP what your follow up questions might 
be... If I get them before 1:00 or 2:00 I might get them back to you 
today)

Lethar - ancient race of bodychangers that was almost eradicted 
before 	man was evolved. They and the elves are of an age- with 	the Lethar 
being slightly older.

Dau Shao - country NE of Doria, based on Russia circa 1300 or so 

Dal Sho - Actually a city that was the capital of Dau Shao. Now 	
inhabited by undead and ruled by a Lord Vampire. Known 	affectionately as "The 
Dead City"

Dau Pen - Dragon King that is worshipped primarily in Bengalli and 	
southern Doria. Is actually, as the elves know, 

Kolara - I have no idea- where did you get this name? 

Arcimean (MAGE OF THE CITADEL OF THE SEVEN) - This seems right. 

And never mind about Dof Sifrin, I found his spelling in a note you 
sent on the gates.

What are you doing tonight....?

Chris says:

Hope whatever came up works out. I need to ask you what we should do 
about Shapeshifter issues that can't be role-played out during the regular 
session. You don't have the time outside of a day when we all get together, 
and I don't want to monopolize the session with things that I want to do 
with my character that he has time to do. What I would like to do is 
establish a list of things that each character wishes to resolve between one 
session and the next and then find out the results of those items before the 
session starts on the next date. I would much rather resolve issues by 
arbitrary decision than let them hang as we have. What do you think? 

CHRIS


Alex replies:

Hmmm... sounds good. If you sent/gave me lists of things you would 
want resolved in this fashion I would have them ready for the run...
