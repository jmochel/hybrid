        <title>Character Generation</title>
        <para>
        The player starts with points for buying statistics and several other pools 
        of points used for character development. The three 
        pools are Personal Development, Status, and Wealth. The player starts 
        with 125 points for statistics and 10 points in the Personal 
        Development Pool. 
        </para>
        <para>
        With these points the player buys what is needed for the initial 
        character development. This includes the Race, Special Abilities, and 
        Culture of the character. 
        </para>
        <para>
        Then the player generates the history of the character. The player 
        picks the career path the character will follow and uses the results 
        of that career to put points into the other pools.

            <para>
            In generating the statistics of the character the player distributes 
            125 points among the 10 primary statistics. The minimum number of points that may be
            put into a statistic is 5. The maximum amount that may be placed into
            a statistic is 25.

            <title>Careers</title>
            <para>            
            The next step is determining the career path the character
            took up until the start of play. This is where a majority of a character's
            skills and history will be developed. The process is fairly simple:
            the player selects the career they wish to enter and then they roll 
            for the character to gain skills, wealth, and status during each 
            year they are in that career. 
            </para>
            <para>            
            During the rolling of a characters points are added
            or subtracted from three ``pools''. These three pools : Personal,
            Wealth, and Status are the basis of the final resolution of
            the character's skills, history, and station.
            </para>
            <para>            
            Each of the available paths has its own advantages and disadvantages.
            Educational careers give one little chance to injure one's self but the
            possible monetary gains are low.  Military careers are dangerous, but
            possibly fairly rewarding.
            </para>
            <para>            
            The three pools each have a different basic function.
            The Personal Development pool serves as the point pool for
            increasing a PC statistics, skills, or creating special abilities.
            The Wealth pool contains points to be spent in establishing the
            character's basic financial state.
            The Status pool contains points to be spent in gaining all the
            possible trappings of status: reputation, syncophants, or recognition.

            one point.
            \footnote{!!!! How do I clearly describe what a skill pacakge is here}

            What we have discussed up till now has been single skills.
            Quite often the character will be using a skill package.
            A skill package is a collection of related skills that have a bundled 
            experience point cost. All skills in a skill package may be used 
            normally.

            <title>Enhancements and Limitations</title>
            <para>
            After a character has some points in the three pools associated with
            character creation ( personal, wealth, status) they may choose to
            use them to buy Enhancements that will add flavour to the character.
            </para>
            <para>
            There are always the base enhancements allowed to the character. The
            points in the personal pool can be used to buy skills at the generation
            cost. The points in the personal pool can be used to buy stats at the costs
            listed in the stat cost tables.
            </para>
            <para>
            Enhancements are gains in either background or special abilities that
            can be paid for with points from one of the pools. There are two main
            types. There are Character Enhancements and there are
            Environmental Enhancements.
            </para>
            <para>
            Character Enhancements are natural aptitudes that are typically 
            permanent and inherent to the character's makeup. Enhanced hearing or
            eidetic memory are examples of Character Enhancements.
            </para>
            <para>
            Environmental Enhancements are typically advantages that depend on  the
            character to maintain them. Such as inherited wealth and various components 
            of status.
            </para>
        </sect1>

        <sect1>
            <title>Character Enhancements</title>
            </para>
            <para>
            Character Enhancements have both Depth and Scope to help govern their cost.
            Depth refers to the numeric advantage given by the enhancemnet in a given
            area. The scope denotes the number of different areas that the spab
            may be applicable to. In the case of raising a character statistic the 
            scope refers to the number of other stats affected.
            </para>
            <para>
            A charcter enhancement that involves enhancing a statistic is different from 
            raising the statistic. A raised statistic ends up increasing the SB of the 
            character in that stat. The enhanced stat increases the Rank of the 
            character for any direct rolls against that stat. Thus an Enhanced Stat
            affects Saving Throws and Concentration Checks.

                The first and most commonly used is the wealth advantage. This differs
                from the basic wealth that can be gained by spending the points from the
                wealth pool in that the gain is approximately one third that of a pure
                monetary spend, but the gain so obtained is income that will continue to
                be generated for as long as the PC pays attention to the interests that
                generate the funds. The larger the income the more work involved in
                maintaining it.

                <para>
Another important Environmental Enhancement is that of Friends. Friends
have a depth associated with them dependent on how much they can be
counted upon. The scope is dependent on how easily the PC can access
that Friend.
