"But Well Begun"

Scene: Mountain trail in the Rockies near what once was Arizona

The sun's light washed up onto the edge of the cliff 
and across the boots of a single man come to greet the dawn.
His two watchdogs spent all of their attention on the threats 
the dawn could conceal. For them, the atmospheric prism and 
its colors were of technical interest only. Aesthetics was not 
part of their task.

Unmoving as the granite he rested on, the watcher let the 
light rise along his worn fatigues, his shoulder tabs and 
his face, feeling the warmth seep into those places in 
his soul grown to small for anything else. The face 
that took in the dawn was worn, scored with weariness and 
pared down to the basic elements of the man. No less 
weathered the man than the face of the cliff he rested upon.
The Foreign Legion produced such faces, worn commanders of 
remote outposts who no longer even remembered their cause 
but fought on with the habits of a lifetime of command. These 
eyes, like those, had no room left for deceit. Knowledge of 
self, sufficient unto itself, had taken its hold.

With a low sigh, this face turned away from the edge. 
A glance to the right showed another early riser walking 
the path. Walking it quietly too, to judge by the now 
reacting watch dogs. Their movements to shield him brought 
her head up. Plain, black haired but faired skinned and dressed in 
blue denims with a beaded vest worn loose. Leather headband 
across long hair, cane, wicker basket and an old battered canteen 
completed the image of a back-to-earther dropout. Only the eyes 
held the promise of depth. Eyes as experienced as the watcher's
but no exhaustion rested there and no request for further purpose 
marred the glance that moved across the three men.

The watch dogs moved again, with reactions and skills silently 
snarling at the necessity for constraint. A single hand came 
to rest on her sleeve. 

"Citizen, perhaps it would be better if you were to wait 
outside this area a moment longer."

With no sign that she felt the hand she looked out over the 
edge.

"Enjoying the dawn ? I am not suprised. I half think that 
god rested here when the need came for a break. After all, 
why labor at creation if you can't enjoy it ?" 

A flicker of interest woke in the watcher's face. He unclasped 
his hands and moved them to a position in front of him. Speaking 
down at them he took the first step.

"You speak as if you understand creation." 

Calloused fingers moved delicately to a watch dog's wrist.
The watch dog, reduced in some subtle way from participant 
to bystander, awoke from his fascination with the tableau 
to discover that his hand no longer encompassed hers. His 
confused glance to his partner reflected his lack of 
preparation for this. Not even a sideways glance revealed 
her awareness of his confusion. Her voice was even.

"I understand purpose. You live here long enough, you 
understand purpose. It rolls on like the hills themselves.
Can't avoid it without leaving. Even then, it might echo 
in the back of your head for a bit."

His eyes came up from his hands.

"Gentlemen, please. I would speak with her."

Those eyes locked onto hers with a look of heroic 
preparation. So might have the 300 looked as they 
hefted their shields at Thermopylae. 

"And what do you do if your creation has already achieved 
its purpose ?" 

"Hmmph. If you no longer see a purpose for it then others 
will, or it will find its own."

His eyes cast down again.

"And what if your creation is an organization made up of 
people ? Are you responsible for their well being ?"

"If it will make you happy dear, you can be."

He jerked his head up and stared at her. She laughed at 
his expression of annoyance. A single eyebrow cocked upward.

"If it is an organization than you never created it. You 
may have pointed the way, but all in it own it. You 
get what you take on. No more."

He frowned at her. She glanced to his side.

"Should I guess the organization ?"

"If you do I will not be able to return here." 

"Have you ever thought about what happens to king makers ?"

He paused at the change in direction. With a wary nod he 
gestured her to go on.

"Most are as emphemeral as those they put on the throne. 
None are truly known for their deeds. All die. A chosen 
few die knowing they have built something that will last 
in the memories of all who come after for good or ill."

She reached out her hand. Small fingers wrapped around his. 

"Come, turn and look."

She scrunched her face at the tensing watch dogs.
She leads him to the edge. 

"Look down. What happens to the world if you jump ?"

"Do you think I haven't thought about it ?"

"I didn't ask if you had thought about it. I asked you 
what would happen if you did."

"I don't have to answer that !"

"That is the crux, isn't it ! Nothing tells you that it 
must be done. Therefore it doesn't have to be done. 
Then consider it a duty for now. We can rewrite 
history later if we have to."

"All right. If I jump nothing happens."

"I hope that you are a better soldier than a logician.
If you jump they go on. But they lose. They lose the 
knowledge and guidance of your years and they lose the 
vision. They will get another vision, that is true. Not 
the same but it will serve."

"I knew that I was not irreplaceable."

"I said they lose. You are irreplaceable. Another can 
do the job but it won't be the same job. Your creation 
will live on, though it won't be the same creation."

"But they are there , it is built."

She listened as his voice raised in volume. She quirked 
up one side of her face.

"What more needs to be done ?"

Up came the the other corner of her mouth.

"And why should I be the one to do it ?"

A full grin broke out. In the smallest voice possible she 
choked out:

"Because you are here ?"

Impossibly, he laughed. A sense of the other's amused passion 
took residence in his own smile. 

"And your advice is ?"

"Available any time you want to come up here."

"That is not what I meant. "

"I know."

She let his hand free. She walked over to mouth of the 
trail. 

"But I do suggest that you get cracking."

He looked around and gestured one of his watch dogs 
before him. As he turned back he looked at her and 
cocked an eyebrow.

"Why, did you not realize ? You are but well begun."

As they started through she stepped back and 
brought bladed hand to eyebrow with a quivering 
snap. They paused. and then slowly, against all 
Cadre regulations and precedent his watch dogs 
replied in kind. At a walk with no fanfare 
they passed in review. As they filed out of sight 
she dropped salute and leaned back against the rock. 

"After all, even Ambrosius knew despair."
