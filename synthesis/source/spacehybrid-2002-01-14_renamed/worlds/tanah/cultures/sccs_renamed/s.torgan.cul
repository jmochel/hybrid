\section*{Resources}

\section*{Technology}

Probably one of the most sophisticated races technologically, the
Torgans have the beginings of a true steel based economy. THey have
many skilled mechanicians and and understand much of basic physics.
Simple steam engines, Lanterns, Screws and levers are quite common.
Metal springs are known as are simple mechanical dart guns. The use of
a simple smoke powder is well known and so is the use of Naptha. Water
clocks and a standard set of weights and measures. Surveying and road
building are well honed skills. Plumbing is a known quantity as is
composting sewage.

\section*{Magic}

\section*{Subsistence Patterns}

Both hunters and farmers. Their hunts tend to be of a
communal type. Well advanced in farming and erosion theory.
Generally comfortable with grains and root crops as well as
fruit orchards. Vine crops are also very common - Especially
wine grapes and climbing melon.

\section*{Values and Kinship}

Torgans value bravery, skill and beauty. They are much given
to song and music. Generally they will hold a singer or
harper inviolate unless the harper blasphemes. They
particularly honor bravery evidenced by self sacrifice and
favor tragic and loving songs. Kinships are reckoned by
descent through the female and are very important to
Torgans.

\section*{Language}

\subsection*{Language Tree}

The Torgan language is not Orcish as would be expected from
their appearance. It is a fairly formal latinesque language.
It shares some common roots with the elven tounge spoken
today. In particular it uses the older elven phrases for
special names and formal phrases.

\subsection*{Literacy}
Literacy is restricted to Women, Seers, Mages and scribes. Fairly
widepread but with definitive degrees of literacy between
various classes. Military leaders often learn a basic battle
language called Habaksa. A mixture of old Sift-Rak and
written symbols derived from hand motions.

\subsection*{Writing Forms}

They use a stilted and formal runic language. Shares some traits with
written Bitadari and Dwarven.

\subsection*{Vocabulary and Grammar}

\begin{tabbing}

\end{tabbing}

\section*{Religion,Myths,and History}

The Torgans believe in the Nadir or fates, and a pantheon of
gods reminescent of Roman and Syria.  They are fairly pious
and hold most reverence for the father and mother of the
gods.

Each household rests their fortunes with a founding spirit
and each legion believes themselves to be the incarnation of
their totem.

\section*{Tradition}

Names and Naming traditions are a major part of Torgan life. There is a use name,
a true name, a house name, and a fame name.

\subsection*{Command}

The command structure of the Torgan legions is fairly complex. The
complexity is not due to their chain of command this is actually fairly
simple, it is due to the additional layer of cultural interaction and
training.

The Chain of command goes in the following order:

\begin{verbatim}
The Senate Council
		|
		|
		V
  The 13 Legions ---> The High Battle Masters
                                |
                                |
                                V
        Kinturions ( Leader of 1000 )
                                |
                                |
                                V
        Centurions ( Leader of 100 )
                                |
                                |
                                V
        Sarisani ( Leader of 50 )
                (Lance Leader)
                                |
                                |
                                V
        Praetor ( Leader of 5 (hand) )
\end{verbatim}

Each of the 13 legions actually varies in number between one thousand
and six thousand troopers or Katern. Each of the legions is noted for a
particular specialty , usually related in someway to the legion totem.

The 13 legions are :

\begin{itemize}
        \item [The Auric Dragon]   The Very Best
        \item [The Crystal Pheonix]  Strategists and Tacticians
        \item [The White Wolf]   Scouts and Hunters
        \item [The Black Courser]  Mounted Lance
        \item [The Red Bear]  Shock Troops
        \item [The Scarlet Hynd]  Runners and Mappers and Signalers
