\section*{Description}

Lithe and fast as a weasal is a typical description of the Duwan.
They are small hard muscled people with (typically) long hair and 
saintly faces. 

In general they are a rarely understood or trusted race. They are thought to be thieves
and murderers as well as smugglers, bringers of disease and general 
agents of chaos.
