\section*{Description}

Kurrock are truly the most frightening fighters and drinkers around.
They tend to get a reputation for just those things as a result but in
reality, Kurrock are also skilled artisans, mechanicians, and miners.

They are intense and focused , which makes them a subject of unease for 
most humans. They rarely get distracted and have a strong scorn for those 
that do.

Despite their low PSI they seem to excel in producing weapons and 
tools that are almost magical  in quality.
