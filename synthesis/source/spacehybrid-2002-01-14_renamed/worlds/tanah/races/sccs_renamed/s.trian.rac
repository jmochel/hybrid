\section*{Description}

Found mostly in the volcanic regions far south of the holy empire
of light.

Tor-Rians are the wild and fiery clan of the giants. Quick to speak and 
quick to anger the Tor-Rians are rarely seen outside of their own 
mountain ranges. 

Like all giants , they cannot lie, and in fact the Tor-Rians are known
for blurting the truth and their opinions out with out any hesitation.
Self control is a rare virtue among them.

Despite this they have a strong, perhaps even brutal, sense of justice 
that seems somewhat barbaric to humans.

They are all said to be great mages of the fire magics.
