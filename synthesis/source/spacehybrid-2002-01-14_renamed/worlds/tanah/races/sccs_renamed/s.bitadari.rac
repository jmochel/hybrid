\section*{Description}

The Bitadari are not your typical elves. They are a race with a lifestyles 
and cultures based on the fact that they go through different life cycles 
and forms.
Bitadari speak of distinct "Life Ages" or K\={i}. These are
distinct forms. These forms have some basis in how old the elf is\footnote{There is almost
no correlation to the chronological ages of the entity.} They are in
name : Chawara (Infancy), Iquira (\={E}-kwer-a) (Childhood), Anatathan
(An-a-ta-than) (Young Adult), Laenya (L\={a}-\={e}-nya) (Time of Passing),
Sheerahnen (She-\={e}-rah-n\={e}n) (Fullness), Eya (\={E}-ya) (Inward Turning).

As a race the population of elves is driven by the environment. If 
Anatathan are needed than more Iquira become Anatathan and less Anatathan 
become Laenya. In times of war there will be more Anatathan than Iquira.

\subsection*{Chawara {\it (Infancy)} }

\begin{quote}
\it A path is decided by the first step, and no sooner. - Elven Proverb.
\end{quote}

An elven child is born without hair or nails. Almost no real
vision is developed until a month after birth. Empathy, for many, is at
the strongest it will be ever be. The environment empathically
influences the future forms of the Elf. It is conceivable that the
first hint of mage talents could be seen here. For non-mage children
this empathy will diminish as the entity enters Iquira. Mesaah
(M\={E}-SA-AH) or mage children, will retain much of their empathy. (2-3
years) . Twins are almost unheard of and triplets are truly unknown.
Eyes are often pale and almost clear.

\subsection*{Iquira {\it (Childhood)}}

Empathy tends to drop to its lowest point. Much of the energies
turn toward care of almost all domestic activities. Farming is more
common than hunting and meat eating is rare. Most of the farming is
small lot based. As the elf matures ( 20-200 years)  In times of large
population growth a small percentage of Iquira never go on to the state
of Anatathan. The gradually diminishing empathy comes to be superseded
by a mild form of telepathy. Iquira have crystalline colors in their
eyes.

\subsection*{Anatathan {\it (Young Adult)}}

The anatathan are the warriors, the fighters. As they get older
, they gain in natural speed and perception. It is here that most elves
can become fertile though only during periods of stress for the race do
many anatathan have children. And , when they do, these same children
tend to be quick to become Anatathan. It is often that during these
periods of stress that Anatathan never become Laenya. It is said to be
a sacrifice that the elf's spirit made for the race. For this reason
it is appropriate to mourn the passing of an Anatathan where one would
not mourn a Laenya ( who did, after all, lived out a full life ).
Typically lasts between 20 - 300 years. Anatathan eyes are usually
brighter colored , hovering between translucent and transparent.

\subsection*{Laenya {\it (Fullness)}}

Those that live on to become Laenya gain in empathy again and
tend to pursue their final goals. They become leaders and mages ,
craftsman and artists. More live to become Laenya during the peaceful
times. The natural magics intensify and become very noticeable. The
reflexes do not slow but the combat perceptions gradually fade. The
elf's knowledge of his body becomes nearly complete. Poisoning and
disease becomes rarer. The Laenya eyes tend to be darker and definitely
opaque. The period lasts between 900 and 1000 years.

\subsection*{Ea {\it (Inward Turning)}}

Those who live to this most venerated state are rare. The elves'
empathy becomes almost as great as when they were Chawara. Their
empathy gradually extends to all life within their perception. The eyes
darken to nearly black and their sight loses all IR and Visible acuity.
Only the UV and shorter wavelengths are used. The greatest philosophies
and thoughts of the elven culture come from those who have achieved
this state.

\section*{Abilities of Bitadaran}

In general the elves have a variety of talents. They have a
greater than average PSI and are comfortable with basic sorceries. Most
forms have a DF +1 when doing minor magics or sorceries.
Anatathan have a DF-1 to minor magery. Anatathan often
produce unpredictable results with those magics they do use.

Most elves are less physically enduring and less strong then 
their human counterparts. 

\subsection*{Faen}

Faen is the proximity sense that is first developed by the
Iquira and is most visible in the Anatathan. At any point that an
entity enters within an Anatathan's perception (GAW in feet) their
perception increases briefly (As per setup).

All perception rolls are made based on this increased perception.
This perception comes to the elf during times of stress and is often
visible to others as a drastic change in the reflective patterns of the
eyes. Also, any agility or strengthed based feat is a little easier (DF +1).

\subsection*{Alitharinaa(Sense of self)}

At a time of injury, infection, or poisoning. The Bitadara
often will go into a kind of "Healing Shock". This state is seen as a
complete darkening of the entire eye of the Elf. This state allows for
the regrowth of endurance as if it were fatigue. (Excludes cold Iron
damage)

\subsection*{Kiilan(Mind Seeing)}

During Early stages this shows itself as empathy and then
telepathy and finally, both.

\subsection*{Cold Iron(Irinal)}

Iron (not steel) is the true bane of Bitadaran life. All Iron
wounds (Fatigue or endurance) are burns as well as the normal damage.
Any such injury requires a MST s.t. to prevent being stunned. Such
wounds require $ 2 \times $ the normal time to heal.
