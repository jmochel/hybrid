Hello There,
  My name is Jim Mochel and I am new to this list. I am hoping that someone 
  here can point me in the right direction in some research I am doing. I
  am designing a fairly realistic wargame simulation. In doing so I have 
  spent the past two years gathering information on basic human capabilities and 
  attributes involving fatigue, reaction times, hand to hand combat, healing,
  sleep deprivation, etc.. Most of this information has been found in Biomechanics 
  Conferences and Human Factors Society proceedings. Unfortunately there are 
  still some gaps in my knowledge. 
  
  The areas I have almost nothing about are as follows:
  
  1. The times taken to swing verious objects. Does it vary greatly with the strength
  of the individual involved ? Does the length of the object have a greater effect than
  the mass ?  Does using two hands speed a swing or slow it down ? I have not even found 
  a good description of the time it takes to swing a baseball bat or tennis racket.
  
  2. A basic discussion of wound trauma. Especially for Blunt and edged weapons.
  Data on Ballistics Wound trauma is also of interest.
  
  I have a solid background in physics and some familiarity with kinematics so 
  have no fear that any information you provide may be too technical for me.
  
  With Thanks,
  
    Jim Mochel
