<H3>Founding of the Brotherhood</H3>
<P>Millions upon millions of years ago in the darkness of prehistory, humanity
was an infant, a child of Mother Nature, unawakened, dreamlike, wrapped in the
cloak of mental somnolence. Recognition of egoity slept; instinctual
consciousness alone was active. Like a stream of brilliance across the horizon
of time, divine beings, manasaputras, sons of mind, descended among the sleeping
humans, and with the flame of intellectual solar fire lighted the wick of latent
mind, and lo! the thinker stirred. Self-consciousness wakened, and man became a
dynamo of intellectual and emotional power: capable of love, of hate, of glory,
of defeat. Having knowledge, he acquired power; acquiring power, he chose;
choosing, he fashioned the fabric of his future; and the perception of this ran
like wine through his veins.
</P>
<P>Knowledge, more knowledge, and still greater knowledge was required by the
maturing humans who looked with gratitude to the godlike beings who had come to
awaken them. For many centuries they followed their guidance, as children
lovingly follow the footsteps of their mother.
</P>
<P>As the ages rolled by, a circulation of divine instructors succeeded these
primeval manasaputras and personally supervised the progress of child-humanity:
they initiated them in the arts and sciences, taught them to sow their fields
with corn and wheat, instructed them in the ways of clean and moral living -- in
short, established primeval schools of training and instruction <EM>open and
free to all</EM> to learn of things material, intellectual, and spiritual. At
this early period there were no <EM>Mystery</EM> colleges: the ancient wisdom
was the common heirloom of all mankind, for as yet there had been no abuse of
knowledge, and hence no need for bodies kept hid and sacred from the world.
Truth was freely given and as freely accepted in that golden age. (Cf. H. P.
Blavatsky,
<CITE>Collected Writings</CITE> (hereafter <CITE>BCW</CITE>) 14:248-9.)
</P>
<P>The race was young; not all were adept in learning. Some through past
experience in former world periods learned quickly and with ease, choosing
intuitively the path of spiritual intellection; others, less awake, were good
though wayward in progress; while a third class of humans, drugged with inertia,
found learning and aspiring a burden and became laggards in the evolutionary
procession. To them, spiritual death was preferable to spiritual exertion.
</P>
<P>Mankind as a whole progressed rapidly in the acquirement of knowledge and
its subsequent use. Some obviously wrought evil -- others good. What had been
latent spirituality now became active good and active evil. Suffering and pain
became nature's most merciful method of restoring the heart to its primeval
instinct, that of spiritual choice. As mind developed keener potentialities and
the struggle for mental supremacy overcame the spiritual, this gift of intellect
became a double-edged weapon: on the one hand, the bringer of spiritual
awareness and undreamed of intellectual ecstasy; and on the other, the wielder
of a weapon of destruction, of horror, and in the worst cases of actual
diabolism. As H. P. Blavatsky wrote:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The mysteries of Heaven and Earth, revealed to the Third Race by their
celestial teachers in the days of their purity, became a great focus of light,
the rays from which became necessarily weakened as they were diffused and shed
upon an uncongenial, because too material soil. With the masses they degenerated
into Sorcery, taking later on the shape of exoteric religions, of idolatry full
of superstitions, . . . -- <CITE>The Secret Doctrine</CITE>, 2:281
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Nature is cyclical throughout: at one time fertile in spiritual things, at
another barren. At this long-ago period of the third root-race, on the great
continent of Lemuria, now submerged, the cycle was against spiritual progress. A
great downward sweep was in force, when expansion of physical and material
energies were accelerated with the consequent retardation and contraction of
spiritual power. The humanity of that period were part of the general
evolutionary current, and individuals reacted to the coarsening atmosphere
according to their nature. Some resisted its downward influence through awakened
spirituality; others, weaker in understanding, vacillated between spirit and
matter, between good and evil: sometimes listening to the whisper of intuition,
at others submerged by the rushing waves of the downward current. Still others,
in whom the spark of intellectual splendor burned low, plunged headlong down the
stream unmindful of the turbulent and muddy waters.
</P>
<P>As the downward cycle proceeded, knowledge of spiritual verities and living
of the life in accordance with them became a dull and useless tool in human
hearts and minds. Such folly was inevitable in the course of cosmic events, and
all things were provided for. Just as there are many types of people -- some
spiritual, others material, some highly intelligent, others slow of thought --
so are there various grades of beings throughout the universe, ranging from the
mineral, through the vegetable, beast, and human kingdom, and beyond to the head
and hierarch of our earth. During these first millennia this spiritual head and
guardian of the earth had been watching, guiding, stimulating wherever possible
the individual fires of active spirituality; gradually as millennium succeeded
millennium and knowledge of divine things became abused by those strong in will
but weak in morality, the truth was veiled. The planetary watcher now felt the
need of selecting a band of coworkers to act as bodyguard and protector of the
ancient wisdom. Alone a handful of spiritually illumined human beings, in whom
the divine fervor burned bright, acknowledged wholehearted allegiance to their
planetary teacher -- the spiritual hierarch of humanity. Through the centuries
stronghearted individuals had been watched over, guided, strengthened, and
tested in innumerable ways, and those who passed the test of self-knowledge and
self-sacrifice were gathered together to form the first association or college
of spiritual human beings -- the Great Brotherhood:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Then was formed or established or set in operation the gathering together of
the very highest representatives, spiritually and intellectually speaking, that
the human race as yet had given manifestation to; . . .
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>. . . the Silent Watcher of the Globe, through the spiritual-magnetic
attraction of like to like, was enabled to attract to the Path of Light, even
from the earliest times of the Third Root-Race, certain unusual human
individuals, early forerunners of the general Manasaputric 'descent,' and thus
to form with these individuals a Focus of Spiritual and Intellectual Light on
Earth, this fact signifying not so much an association or society or brotherhood
as a unity of human spiritual and intellectual Flames, so to speak, which then
represented on Earth the heart of the Hierarchy of Compassion. . . .
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Now it was just this original focus of Living Flames, which never
degenerated nor lost its high status of the mystic center on Earth through which
poured the supernal glory of the Hierarchy of Compassion, today represented by
the Great Brotherhood of the Mahatmans . . . Thus it is that the Great
Brotherhood traces an unbroken and uninterrupted ancestry back to the original
focus of Light of the Third Root-Race. -- <CITE>The Esoteric Tradition</CITE>,
1048-9n
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>There in Sambhala the elder brothers of the race remain &quot;the elect
custodians of the Mysteries revealed to mankind by the divine Teachers . . .
these Elect were the germ of a Hierarchy <EM>which never died since that period</EM>&quot;
-- since the foundation and establishment of the great Brotherhood some 12
million years ago. (<CITE>The Secret Doctrine</CITE> 2:281.) From this center
for millions of years have been streaming in continuous procession rays of
spiritual strength into the world at large, and more specifically into the
hearts of those whose lives are dedicated to the service of truth. From this
secret retreat have gone forth messengers, masters of wisdom, to found the grand
religions of the past, and they will continue to send forth their envoys as long
as mankind requires their care.</P>
<HR>
<H4><A NAME="chapter2">Chapter 2</A></H4>
<H3>The First Mystery Schools</H3>
<P>Time marched on and the race waxed lusty in power. As Lemuria gave birth to
Atlantis, the third root-race to the fourth, the fiercest battle of antiquity
was waged: the war between the lords of light and truth and the lords of
darkness and ignorance.
</P>
<P>Moral strength is not guaranteed by awakening intellect nor by the
possession of psychic and physical power. The Atlanteans at their acme of
development were a civilization of vigorous intellect motivated by
psychophysical force, unreined by moral strength. Magic, which had been a
natural gift of the Lemurians, in the hands of these giants became matter magic,
psychical magic, and the race plunged into an orgy of sorcery, the effects of
which we are experiencing even today in a tragedy of hate and madness.
</P>
<P>Not all the Atlanteans, however, were overpowered by their own strength; not
by any means. Nevertheless, a great portion of them became sorcerers of evil and
perished in their tracks. Others in whom the light of spirituality was &quot;seen
as through a glass darkly,&quot; became unhappy victims of the nefarious waves
of unmoral power that swept over the continental system of Atlantis; in their
confusion they wandered hither and yon, following false gods, unworthy guidance.
A few -- probably several millions, but few in proportion to the enormous
population of the Atlantean continents -- remained strong and clean throughout,
morally illumined through contact with spirit. These became the chosen disciples
of the Brotherhood, the stimulators of virtue and discipline in the land.
</P>
<P>In the early millennia there had been no Mysteries, truth having been the
common property of mankind. With the increase of egoity,
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Selfishness was born out of desires and passions hitherto unknown, and but
too often knowledge and power were abused, until finally it became necessary to
limit the number of those <EM>who knew</EM>. Thus arose Initiation. -- <CITE>BCW</CITE>
14:249
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>To insure the safety of the race, something had to be done. Civilization had
come to such a pass that the only safeguard was to establish a spiritual center
in each national unit which would act as a bodyguard for the truths imparted
there and as a secret training center where individuals could be disciplined and
instructed and, if found worthy, could learn truth at firsthand -- i.e., through
initiation.
</P>
<P>The Brotherhood, therefore, which had already established invisible lines of
esoteric instruction even in late Lemurian times, in which those sensitive
enough to such could be trained, purified, and made strong for the reception of
truth and its safeguarding, now launched a systematic campaign. Disciples,
messengers, went forth and inaugurated esoteric colleges, universities of the
soul, special training centers for the select purpose of gathering into them the
choicest men and women for discipline and instruction in the mysteries of
nature.
</P>
<P>Thus were established some four or five millions of years ago, when Atlantis
was threatening to destroy itself through spiritual iniquity, the first Mystery
schools. From these early centers sprang other Mystery schools in all parts of
the Atlantean world. By the time the Atlanteans were in their heyday of <EM>material</EM>
splendor, these schools were working their hardest to stem the increasing tide
of sorcery. Many -- millions in fact -- were saved through the establishment of
the Mysteries. The superior of the race intuitively sought training there, while
the great bulk of humanity, though unable to partake in the sacred rites of
initiation on account of insufficient interior development, nevertheless were
helped by the indirect radiation of spiritual force.
</P>
<P>There were those, however, who had tasted of evil and found it to their
liking, and whose hardening hearts led them to receive instruction in evil
discipline. Simultaneously, therefore, with the establishment of spiritual
centers of light and truth, there were schools of evil founded, whose pledged
votaries became in time the left-hand adepts. The lords of light and truth
united in a calm invincible force to
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>resist the terrible and ever-growing iniquities of the lefthand Adepts, the
Atlanteans. This led to the foundation of still more Secret Schools, temples of
learning, and of Mysteries inaccessible to all except after the most terrible
trials and probations. . . .
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The Mysteries were imparted to the elect of that Race when the average
Atlantean had begun to fall too deeply into sin to be trusted with the secrets
of Nature. -- <CITE>BCW</CITE> 14:251, 246
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>There now occurred the most dramatic moment -- a moment millions of years
long -- in the whole history of this round: the turning point of the cycle from
matter to spirit. At the middle of the fourth root-race on this fourth round the
Atlanteans saw spirit and matter equilibrated: <EM>which way would the scales
turn?</EM> Towards light and spirit, and the final liberation of mankind?
Towards darkness and matter, and the enslavement of humanity? A great tremor
shook the earth: would innate spirituality prove stronger than the weight of
acquired materiality? Would mankind ascend the ladder of evolution up the
luminous arc, or through folly and iniquity fall headlong down into the pit of
matter of the descending shadowy arc? Of the billions of human beings whose
hearts must be weighed against the feather of spirit, each one had to pass the
fateful test alone: failure, and the rush downwards into still greater
materiality unable to rise to spirit during the great period of manvantara;
success, and the rise upwards in the general current of evolutionary progress
until oneness with divinity is again reclaimed.
</P>
<P>The moment of a million years or so passed. Fortunately for the human race,
due primarily to the efforts of the Mystery schools, the majority retained
sufficient awareness of divinity to balance the scales in their favor. An
unconscious choice for millions, but nevertheless a choice made by the better
part of their natures -- by what slender majority perhaps we shall never know.</P>
<HR>
<H4><A NAME="chapter3">Chapter 3</A></H4>
<H3>The Raison d'Etre of the Mysteries</H3>
<P>Cataclysm after cataclysm occurred, and the fourth race sank to its doom,
deluged by the waters of heaven and earth as they flooded the lands according to
karmic law. Along with the sinking of Atlantis, which extended over several
million years, new lands had been rising in other parts of the globe which
became peopled as time went by with certain of the Atlanteans who emigrated in
two or three great migratory waves. (See <CITE>Studies in Occult Philosophy</CITE>,
pp. 16-25.)
</P>
<P>Thus the fourth root-race gave birth to the fifth whose cradleland was the
Desert of Shamo or Gobi and surrounding tablelands -- a country whose present
sandy wastes give no sign of lands once green with verdure, where forests and
lakes witnessed a succession of civilizations the grandest the world has ever
known. Here for many millions of years, while Atlantis was involved in her death
struggle, seeds of the new race were being planted in virgin soil.
</P>
<P>Nature is beneficent in her workings. While the evil consequences of her
human children must be met and faced by them alone through the working of karma
and the cycle of reimbodiment, yet at each new racial birth she casts her seed
in virginal territory, so that the child-race may be conceived in purity and
nurtured in spirituality. Peopled thus with egos who had remained clean and
strong through the tests of Atlantean life, and helped again by the entrance
into her life of semi-divine beings, the new race became a focus of spiritual
light undimmed by the iniquity of Atlantis. As one of the Brothers, the Master
KH, wrote:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>the <EM>highest </EM>Planetary Spirits, those, who can no longer err. . . .
appear on Earth but at the origin of every <EM>new
</EM>human kind; at the junction of, and close of the two ends of the great
cycle. And, they remain with man no longer than the time required for the
eternal truths they teach to impress themselves so forcibly upon the plastic
minds of the new races as to warrant them from being lost or entirely forgotten
in ages hereafter, by the forthcoming generations. The mission of the planetary
Spirit is but to strike the KEY NOTE OF TRUTH. -- <CITE>The Mahatma Letters to
A. P. Sinnett</CITE>, Letter IX, pp. 40-1
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Simultaneously with the establishment of the Mystery schools in Atlantis
some four or five million years ago, the fifth or Aryan race (Aryan, coming from
the Sanskrit word for &quot;noble,&quot; was commonly used for the Indo-European
peoples who migrated out of Central Asia to Europe, the Mideast, and the Indian
peninsula) was slowly coming into being, immensely aided by egos of spiritual
refinement attracted there by ties of divine kinship. Gradually the soil was
prepared and the work of striking the &quot;keynote of Truth&quot; having been
accomplished, the demigods returned to their superior spheres. One million years
ago the new race was ushered into adult existence armed with the knowledge of
spiritual things.
</P>
<P>As the centuries passed and civilization succeeded civilization, the love of
truth once again became dimmed in human hearts and the ancient precepts fell
into disuse. The Mysteries were withdrawn even more, so that the knowledge once
universal became the prized guerdon bestowed by the great Brotherhood upon that
choice minority whose lives were dedicated to truth and truth alone, unstained
by weakness or selfish ambition. With enduring consistency the
<EM>raison d'etre</EM> of the Mysteries has remained threefold in character:
</P>
<P>(1) the persistent spiritualization of the thought-life of humanity so that
knowledge of things spiritual may penetrate into the heart, and life in time may
become a benediction of peace instead of a tragedy of conflict;
</P>
<P>(2) seeding grounds of adepts, nurseries for future recruits, who through
trial and initiation may receive the supreme dignity of membership in the great
Brotherhood; and
</P>
<P>(3) the preservation of truth for future races unsullied by human hand; and
the polishing of the knowledge of truth through investigation by trained seers
of the secrets of universal workings in worlds visible and invisible.
</P>
<P>The first of these aims is fulfilled by the periodic appearance of the great
world teachers, the founders of religious and philosophical schools: messengers
from the Lodge who come forth at cyclic periods to strike anew the archaic
keynote of truth. Hence every great religion, every noble philosophy, every
flash of scientific discovery, was born from the sanctuary as a <EM>new </EM>religion,
a <EM>new
</EM>philosophy, a <EM>new</EM> science: fresh and new for the age and the
people, but ancient beyond time because nurtured in the womb of esoteric
antiquity.
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>All that is good, noble, and grand in human nature, every divine faculty and
aspiration, were cultured by the Priest-Philosophers who sought to develop them
in their Initiates. Their code of ethics, based on altruism, has become
universal. -- <CITE>BCW</CITE> 14:256
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The second of these aims is age-long in accomplishment, and deeply occult:
to awaken the sleeping fire of divinity in the human soul, and through the
kindling of that flame burn the dross of imperfection, sloth, and unworthy
desire from the heart. One of the impelling aims of such discipline is to
restore to humanity <EM>inner </EM>sight, to free people &quot;from every
danger of being enslaved whether by a man or an idea.&quot; (<CITE>BCW</CITE>
14:251; cf. also
<CITE>Mahatma Letters</CITE>, pp. 40-1.)
</P>
<P>The disciple must become <EM>vajra-dhara</EM> (&quot;diamond-bearer&quot;),
a title used of Bodhisattva Gautama, whose many-faceted heart was ever merciful
in reflecting human sorrow, but whose spiritual essence was adamantine as a
diamond, unyielding as its core, to the subtle disguise of maya (&quot;illusion&quot;).
</P>
<P>The third of these aims is made possible through the accomplishment of the
second: the selection of new recruits to the Brotherhood, so that (a) truth may
be preserved untarnished by human folly; and (b) that investigation into the
arcana of nature may go on unhindered, and the results of such experimentation
by generations of trained seers be checked and rechecked, and recorded only then
as occult fact for the benefit of humanity.
</P>
<P>As far as the labor of the Masters concerns the human race in especial, the
following written by one of their number in 1881 speaks for itself:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>If, for generations we have &quot;shut out the world from the Knowledge of
our Knowledge,&quot; it is on account of its absolute unfitness; and if,
notwithstanding proofs given, it still refuses yielding to evidence, then will
we at the End of this cycle retire into solitude and our kingdom of silence once
more. . . . We have offered to exhume the primeval strata of man's being, his
basic nature, and lay bare the wonderful complications of his inner Self --
something never to be achieved by physiology or even psychology in its ultimate
expression -- and demonstrate it scientifically. It matters not to them, if the
excavations be so deep, the rocks so rough and sharp, that in diving into that,
to them, fathomless ocean, most of us perish in the dangerous exploration; for
it is we who were the divers and the pioneers and the men of science have but to
reap where we have sown. It is our mission to plunge and bring the pearls of
Truth to the surface; theirs -- to clean and set them into scientific jewels.
And, if they refuse to touch the ill-shapen, oyster-shell, insisting that there
is, nor <EM>cannot</EM> be any precious pearl inside it, then shall we once
more wash our hands of any responsibility before human-kind. -- <CITE>Mahatma
Letters</CITE>, pp. 50-1
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Unthanked, unknown, unconsidered, the Masters go on in their compassionate
work for mankind's enlightenment, a work that has never ceased in its outpouring
of spiritual vitality for 12 million years, to continue another such period if
necessity demands, until such time as humanity stirs from its lethargy and once
again wills to unite its heart with truth. Master KH continues:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>For countless generations hath the adept builded a fane of imperishable
rocks, a giant's Tower of INFINITE THOUGHT, wherein the Titan dwelt, and will
yet, if need be, dwell alone, emerging from it but at the end of every cycle, to
invite the elect of mankind to co-operate with him and help in his turn
enlighten superstitious man. And we will go on in that periodical work of ours;
we will not allow ourselves to be baffled in our philanthropic attempts until
that day when the foundations of a new continent of thought are so firmly built
that no amount of opposition and ignorant malice guided by the Brethren of the
Shadow will be found to prevail. -- <CITE>Mahatma Letters</CITE>, p. 51 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<H4><A NAME="chapter4">Chapter 4</A></H4>
<H3>The Pattern of Esotericism</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>To the spiritual eagle eye of the seer and the prophet of every race,
Ariadne's thread stretches beyond that &quot;historic period&quot; without break
or flaw, surely and steadily, into the very night of time; and the hand which
holds it is too mighty to drop it, or even let it break. -- <CITE>The Secret
Doctrine</CITE> 2:67
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This thread of esotericism stretches farther still into the dawntime of the
human race, where truth, &quot;high-seated upon its rock of adamant, is alone
eternal and supreme.&quot; (<CITE>Isis Unveiled</CITE> 1:v.) Where is this
truth, this loom of esoteric history, and what the pattern of its fabric? In the
home of the Brotherhood, in Sambhala, stands this loom, whose warp is the
ancient threads of initiation held in occult tension by the sacrifice of adepts,
and whose woof is woven century by century as each nation spins the luminous
threads of esotericism in its Mystery schools.
</P>
<P>Profane history reveals scarcely anything of consecutive value, except
insofar as the relics of this mystic pageantry all point to an identic motif. To
&quot;have a consecutive and full history of our race from its incipient stage
down to the present times,&quot; archaic records must needs be sought. By such
alone can one trace even in dim outline the ancient pattern. Access to these,
however, is the privilege of the adept alone, for such &quot;knowledge is only
for the <EM>highest </EM>Initiates, who do not take their students into their
confidence.&quot; (<CITE>The Secret Doctrine</CITE> 2:437-8.) Nevertheless, we
have received a priceless gift: the benefit of evidence gathered by those who
have penetrated the veils of the adytum and have had the compassion to return
and share with us a guarded portion of their vision. Study of their findings
will reveal to the uninitiate but a broken pattern, but if faithfully pursued
such study will point with unmistakable clarity to one universal source of
truth.
</P>
<P>From Central Asia whose lands comprised a vast territory, including the
Desert of Gobi or Shamo, the mountains of Tien Shan and Kuen Lun, the countries
of Baluchistan, Afghanistan, Persia, and Turkestan, went forth marching bands of
emigrants, in large part glowing with determination to conquer, to subdue, and
many were the battles waged in those primeval days. An efficient cause, yet
unrecognized as such by the multitudes, was the urge of the Brotherhood aided by
karma: the incessant need to carry the light of the Mysteries into other lands,
to spread the ancient wisdom far and wide on the surface of the earth:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Not one people alone inhabited and built up these civilizations of Central
Asia. They were recurrent waves of our present Fifth Root-Race. . . . each one
of such civilizations being in its turn a cradle out of which grew
children-colonies sent forth to carry light and initiation to what were then
barbarous and uncultivated parts of the world, such as what is now Europe, what
is now China, what is now Siberia, what is now India. -- <CITE>Studies in
Occult Philosophy</CITE>, pp. 23, 22
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>To Bharata-varsha or India, the land of the Aryas or &quot;worthy ones,&quot;
marched a band of emigrants who founded a civilization and a culture as yet
unrivaled in esoteric history, whose ramifications of spiritual influence
extended to Egypt, Asia Minor, and Europe. Another band moved westward to Egypt,
the &quot;gift of the Nile&quot; as Herodotus called her, and mixing with the
aboriginal stock peopled her valleys. From this union sprang a princely
civilization, the pride and glory of which remains after thousands of centuries,
the more so as the influence of its Aryan-Egyptian Mysteries spread far and wide
as conquering nation after conquering nation became captive to the interior
grandeur of Egypt. Persia, Babylonia, Judea and Crete, Greece and Rome, all
trace their spiritual inspiration to the Egyptian and early Aryan cultures.
Furthermore, so immense in esoteric power were these primeval civilizations,
that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>there are records which show Egyptian priests -- Initiates -- journeying in
a North-Westerly direction, <EM>by land, via</EM> what became later the Straits
of Gibraltar; turning North and travelling through the future Phoenician
settlements of Southern Gaul; then still further North, until reaching Carnac
(Morbihan) they turned to the West again and arrived, <EM>still travelling by
land</EM>, on the North-Western promontory of the New Continent [the British
Isles].
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>What was the object of their long journey? And how far back must we place
the date of such visits? The archaic records show the Initiates of the Second
Sub-race of the Aryan family moving from one land to the other for the purpose
of supervising the building of <EM>menhirs </EM>and dolmens, of colossal
Zodiacs in stone, and places of sepulcher to serve as receptacles for the ashes
of generations to come. -- <CITE>The Secret Doctrine</CITE> 2:750
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>What was the mainspring of these civilizations but the Mystery-teachings --
teachings which penetrated into the very thought-life of nations, perhaps
unknown of source, unrecognized by the multitudes as esoteric, but actually
constituting the inspiration of the artist in his search for divinity, the
intuition of the poet in his yearning for truth, and the resounding harmony of
the musician as he sought the music of the spheres? It is no idle phrase to say
that all things of spiritual, intellectual, and artistic value were born root
and flower from the sanctuary.
</P>
<P>What are the stone and papyrus of Egypt but startling witness of knowledge
of ancient truths long forgotten? The scenes of the weighing of the heart
against the feather of truth in the papyri of the <CITE>Pert Em Hru</CITE> --
the &quot;Coming forth into Day,&quot; commonly known as the <CITE>Book of the
Dead</CITE> -- portray in symbol and allegory what actually took place in the
secret chambers of the initiation-pyramids, whose living testimonial is the
Great Pyramid of Khufu or Cheops, which H. P. Blavatsky hints more than once may
go back at least 78,000 years BC, if not more. (See <CITE>The Secret Doctrine</CITE>
2:432, 750.)
</P>
<P>What of the Druids and their ancient ceremonies under oak and myrtle, with
their stone monuments so orientated that the beams of the rising sun touched the
brow of the candidate as he rose from his couch of initiation &quot;clothed with
the sun,&quot; literally flaming with solar glory? Whence the training of their
candidates in three degrees, a training which demanded absolute moral purity,
spiritual vigor, and profound understanding of truth?
</P>
<P>What about Persia and her long line of Zoroasters, within whose mystic
seven-chambered centers truths of great intellectual and spiritual value were
taught to neophytes who underwent the same discipline of the Mysteries? Were her
Magi born from any other source than the archaic mother of occultism? What about
the school of Orphic Mysteries, whose austere discipline and esoteric content
influenced perhaps more greatly the stamina of Greek culture than even the
Eleusinian Mysteries so popular for centuries? Did not Orpheus travel to India
and receive initiation in her <EM>asramas
</EM>or mystery-temples? Did not Pythagoras and Plato likewise travel
India-wards and bring back to their disciples the identic pattern of
esotericism?
</P>
<P>Thus one might go on, with the Norse and Germanic mysticism, the Hindu and
Chinese philosophy, the Greek and Roman ceremonial -- all weavers of one pattern
in one universal motif, a motif applicable to all times, to all nations, because
capable of infinite variations without injury to the fundamental theme. To
describe one Mystery school therefore is to describe them all: identic not in
detail of national interpretation, but in fundamental discipline.
</P>
<P>What therefore is the test of truth? Its universality: has it been taught by
all those who have been &quot;clothed with the central sun&quot; of initiation?
Did Buddha-Gautama instruct his disciples in the self-same doctrine that
Christ-Jesus did? Did Sankaracharya teach the same esotericism that Pythagoras
and Empedocles did? Were Zoroaster and Tsong-kha-pa born in their adepthood from
the same womb of the initiation chamber as Apollonius of Tyana, Orpheus, or
Lao-Tsu? Have Persia and Greece, China and ancient America, Wales and Babylonia
all received a message which, stripped of its outer characteristics of national
swabhava, is one in esoteric content? Inevitably so, for such patterns have been
woven on one loom -- the ageless loom of truth.
</P>
<P>These Mystery schools are not a unique system but based on the spiritual
structure of the universe. They were
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>established from the same motives of compassion that presided over the acts
of the great actors of the primal drama, the opening acts of our manvantara.
They copied, as it were in miniature, what took place in those primordial times,
and what took place in actual life in the Hierarchy of Compassion on our earth,
or that section, rather, of the Hierarchy of Compassion which we call the Great
White Lodge. -- <CITE>Fundamentals of the Esoteric Philosophy</CITE>, p. 322
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>One primeval humanity, many children-colonies; one mystery-teaching, many
Mystery schools; one archaic pattern, many variations of color and texture as
each nation contributes the woof of its national Mysteries. Three are the
variants of motif as seen from the present:
</P>
<P>(1) the original unveiling of truth to infant humanity by divine instructors
working in consonance with the spiritual planetary of our earth, who through the
early millennia successfully gathered together the choice few into a center of
esoteric light -- the great Brotherhood;
</P>
<P>(2) the secondary unveiling springing directly as the fruit of the first:
the spiritualizing influences uninterruptedly sent forth by the Lodge, and more
specifically energized at cyclic intervals by their disciples, the great world
teachers; and
</P>
<P>(3) the third unveiling born as the progeny of (1) and (2): the penetration
of truth into human life through the Mystery schools, the centers of esoteric
discipline, in whose inner chambers initiation of the &quot;elect&quot; alone
takes place, but in whose outer courts the world-at-large may seek entrance to
learn fundamental verities, so that life may be ennobled and death faced with
strength and peace. Thus is the pattern of esotericism woven century by century
on the loom of truth.</P>

<H3>Dual Character of the Mysteries</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The whole essence of truth <EM>cannot be transmitted from mouth to ear</EM>.
Nor can any pen describe it, not even that of the recording Angel, unless man
finds the answer in the sanctuary of his own heart, in the innermost depths of
his divine intuitions. -- <CITE>The Secret Doctrine</CITE> 2:516
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>How are those &quot;innermost depths&quot; to be sounded, so that knowledge
of reality may be won? Through training, through discipline, through self-born
wisdom. Such training and soul-discipline is the distinguishing mark of the
Mystery colleges, which since their inauguration have been divided into two
parts: the exoteric form commonly known as the Less Mysteries, open to all
sincere and honorable candidates for deeper learning; and the esoteric form, or
the Greater Mysteries, whose doors open but to the few and whose final
initiation into adeptship is the reward of those whose interior perfection
enables them to pass the solar rite (see chapters 8 and 9 for more complete
information).
</P>
<P>Universal testimony of stone and papyrus, symbol and allegory, cave and
crypt, all tell the self-same story: the twofold trial of their neophytes. Jesus
the avatara spoke to the multitudes in parable, but &quot;when they were alone
he expounded all things to his disciples&quot; (Mark 4:34). The Essenes had
their greater and their minor Mysteries, in the former of which Jesus of
Nazareth is alleged to have been initiated.
</P>
<P>With proud fidelity the Chinese Buddhists hold to a well-loved tradition
that Buddha Gautama had two doctrines: one for the people and his lay-chelas;
the other for his arhats. His invariable principle was
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>to refuse no one admission into the ranks of candidates for Arhatship, but
never to divulge the final mysteries except to those who had proved themselves,
during long years of probation, to be worthy of Initiation. -- <CITE>BCW</CITE>
14:370
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Intensity of vigor marks the Hebrew initiates in their dark shrouding of
inner teaching. To the multitude they taught the doctrine of the Qabbalah, but
to the few they taught its unwritten interpretation, the inner wisdom, &quot;in
'darkness, in a deserted place, and after many and terrific trials.' . . .
Delivered <EM>only as a mystery</EM>, it was communicated to the candidate
orally, <EM>'face to face and mouth to ear</EM>.'&quot; The Persian and
Chaldean Magi also were always of two castes: &quot;the initiated and those who
were allowed to officiate in the popular rites only.&quot; (<CITE>Isis Unveiled</CITE>
2:349, 306n.)
</P>
<P>Eleusis and Samothrace are limned in exquisite silhouette against the
blue-black sky of history. Classical scholars tell us that the Less Mysteries
were conducted in the springtime at Agrae, while the Greater Mysteries were
celebrated in the autumn at Eleusis. In the Less Mysteries the candidates
admitted into the preliminary degrees were called neophytes and were allowed to
witness the dramatic portrayal of the soul's descent into Hades. In the Greater
Mysteries of the Eleusinian rites, the neophytes became the &quot;perfect&quot;
ones, those who participated in the mysteries of the Divine Elysium -- i.e.,
communion with the divine.
</P>
<P>Thus with the Hindu arhat, the Scandinavian initiate, the Welsh bard: all
guarded the citadel of esotericism with the sanctity of their lives and the
discipline of their schools: &quot;Belonging to every temple there were attached
the 'hierophants' of the <EM>inner
</EM>sanctuary, and the secular clergy who were not even instructed in the
Mysteries.&quot; (<CITE>Isis Unveiled</CITE> 2:306n.)
</P>
<P>Further, in all ancient countries &quot;every <EM>great </EM>temple had its
private or secret Mystery-School which was unknown to the multitude or partially
known,&quot; and which was attached to it as a secret body. A Mystery school is
not necessarily a school of people situated at some <EM>specific</EM> place,
with definite and fixed locality throughout time, and with physical conditions
of environment always alike. Wherever the need is great, work must be done; and
the &quot;mistake of all scholars and mystics is to put too much emphasis upon
<EM>places</EM> as Mystery-Schools.&quot; (<CITE>Studies in Occult Philosophy</CITE>,
pp. 635, 634.)
</P>
<P>What about the temples of Greece and Rome, of Syria and Judea; the
cave-temples of Elephanta and Karli in India; the dagobas of Buddhist countries;
the pyramids of Egypt and Peru, Mexico and Yucatan? What of Stonehenge in
England; Carnac in Brittany; Sippara in Assyria; Babylon, Borsippa, and Erech in
Babylonia; Ecbatana in Media; Bibracte in Gaul; and last but not least, Iona in
Scotland whose secret learning was as a jewel of wisdom set in the heart of the
northern land? Where are these now? But names, relics, remnants of forgotten
splendor.
</P>
<P>Hence a Mystery school is not dependent solely on location; rather it is an
association or brotherhood of trained, spiritually disciplined individuals bound
by one common purpose, service to humanity, a service intelligently and
compassionately rendered because born of love and wisdom.
</P>
<P>It is a fact, nevertheless, that certain centers upon the surface of the
earth are more favorable to success in spiritual things than others. Why, for
instance, were these ancient seats of the Mysteries almost invariably in
rock-temple or subterranean cave, in forest or mountain pass, in pyramid chamber
or temple crypt? Because the currents of the astral light become quieter, more
peaceful, cleaner, the farther removed from the madding crowd. Rarely will one
find a seat of esoteric training near a great metropolis, for such are &quot;swirling
whirlpools . . . ganglia, nerve-centers, in the lower regions of the Astral
Light.&quot; (<CITE>The Esoteric Tradition</CITE>, p. 1026.)
</P>
<P>Hence the locations of the Greater Mysteries were usually carefully chosen
and
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>were those which paid no attention to buildings of any kind, mainly for the
reason that buildings would at once attract attention and draw public notice,
which is the very thing that these more secret, more esoteric Schools tried to
avoid. Thus sometimes, when the temples were mere seats of exoteric ritual, the
Mystery-Schools were held apart in secret, conducting their gatherings,
meetings, initiations, initiatory rites, usually in caves carefully prepared and
hid from common knowledge, occasionally even under the open sky as the Druids
did among the oaks in their semi-primeval forests in Britain and in Brittany;
and even in a few cases having no permanent or set location; but the Initiates
receiving word where to meet from time to time, and to carry on their initiatory
functions. -- <CITE>Studies in Occult Philosophy</CITE>, p. 635
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>It is the places of quiet, of peace, of strong silence, where the Masters
find themselves drawn, and where the secret or Greater Mysteries can most easily
and efficiently function. There in the recesses of their initiation chambers the
forces and currents are those of the higher astral light, the akasa, the tenuous
substance which responds to the higher currents of spiritual and intellectual
impression. In this way does the Lodge-force transmit its strength and spiritual
vitality to the initiation halls, and the candidate whose seven-rayed soul is
developed may receive the divine imprint.

<H3>Degrees of Initiation</H3>
<P>Every country has its own methods of preserving the knowledge and tradition
of the Mysteries. At times the degrees are variously reckoned, sometimes four,
five, seven, and even ten; but whatever the divisions, during the days of their
purity they all accomplished the one divine purpose of consummating the
spiritual marriage of the higher self with the awakened human soul, from which
union springs the seer, the adept, the master of life. Through the ravages of
time and priestcraft, and the tangle of intrigue and ignorance in which exoteric
rites have been clothed, one perceives the well-worn tradition.
</P>
<P>In Asia Minor, Theon of Smyrna writes of five degrees in the initiatory
cycle: (1) the previous purification, &quot;for <EM>neither are the Mysteries
communicated to all</EM> who are willing to receive them&quot;; (2) the
admission of the neophyte to the arcane rites following upon the purificatory
refinements; (3) the &quot;epoptic revelation,&quot; or the reception or direct
intuition of truth; (4) the &quot;<EM>binding of the head and fixing of the
crowns</EM>&quot; -- a direct reference to the mystical authority received with
the crown of initiation; and finally (5) &quot;friendship and interior communion&quot;
with divinity -- this was considered the highest and most solemn mystery of all,
the perfect assimilation of the enlightened mind with the divine self. (See
<CITE>Isis Unveiled</CITE> 1:xiv-xv; 2:101.)
</P>
<P>In Persia during the time of Mithraism, when the sun god was honored above
earthly things, seven were the degrees, the candidate receiving a name in
accordance with the stage of interior growth. According to the Greco-Latin names
that have come down to us, the first degree neophyte was called Corax or &quot;raven&quot;
-- the dark bird, one in whom the light of wisdom had not as yet begun to awaken
in great measure; it signified likewise a servant: he who must serve and give of
his heart completely before receiving admission into the second degree which was
termed Cryphius or &quot;occult,&quot; one definitely accepted as a disciple of
esoteric occultism; the third was Miles or &quot;soldier,&quot; signifying one
who had received sufficient training and purification to become a worker for
good. The fourth was called Leo or &quot;lion&quot;: as the lion is an emblem of
solar power, the reference is to the entrance of the candidate upon the fourth
initiation in which begins the conscious solarizing of the nature through
instruction and specialized training (see chapters 7 and 8). The fifth degree
was called Perses or &quot;Persian,&quot; signifying to the Persians of the time
one who was becoming spiritually human -- manasaputrized, so to say; the sixth,
Heliodromus or &quot;messenger or runner of Helios (the sun)&quot; is a distinct
reference to Mercury or Budha, as messenger between the sun in the cosmos and
the sun in man: the bloom of buddhi. The final and seventh was called Pater or &quot;father,&quot;
having in mind &quot;the state of a <EM>Full Initiate</EM> or
<EM>Masterhood</EM>.&quot; (See <CITE>The Esoteric Tradition</CITE>, p. 864.)
</P>
<P>The Hindus likewise had various names for their neophytes as they passed
from one degree to another; in one school the candidates received the names of
the ten avataras of Vishnu. The first degree neophyte was termed Matsya or &quot;fish&quot;:
one yet low in the scale of spiritual mastery. The second was Kurma or &quot;tortoise&quot;:
one step higher in evolutionary development. The third degree was called Varaha
or &quot;boar,&quot; a further advance in individualization, while the fourth
was termed Nara-simha or &quot;man-lion.&quot; This fourth stage signifies the
turning point between the preliminary degrees of the Less Mysteries and the
occultly important degrees of the Greater Mysteries. This title of man-lion is
significant as pointing to the choice demanded of the neophyte between dominance
of animal soul qualities or the supremacy henceforth of the truly human
attributes. Success in this degree insured the entrance into the fifth degree
which was called Vamana or &quot;dwarf,&quot; in which the neophyte assumed the
robes of occult humanhood, though such humanhood was as yet infantile compared
to full mastery. Parasu-Rama or &quot;Rama with an ax&quot; was the name of the
sixth degree neophyte, suggesting one capable of hewing his way with equanimity
through the worlds of spirit and matter. In the seventh degree the disciple
becomes fully humanized, receiving the name of Rama, hero of the <CITE>Ramayana</CITE>,
an important epic of Hindustan.
</P>
<P>The last three degrees, the eighth, ninth, and tenth, are called
respectively: Krishna, the avatara whose death ushered in the kali yuga some
5000 years ago; Buddha, whose renunciation of nirvana brought light and peace to
a sorrowing world; and the final and tenth, Kalkin or Kalki, the &quot;white-horse&quot;
avatara who has not yet come, but who is destined to &quot;appear at the end of
the Kali or Iron Age, seated on a white horse, with a drawn sword blazing like a
comet, for the final destruction of the wicked, the renovation of creation, and
the restoration of purity.&quot; (See Dowson's <CITE>Hindu Classical Dictionary</CITE>,
p. 38.) In ancient symbology the horse signified the sun, hence this tenth
avatara will come riding the steed of solar glory, ushering in the New Age
clothed with the sun of spiritual illumination.
</P>
<P>Seven were the degrees usually contained in the Mysteries, to which the
candidate was admitted; in the Hindu system of ascribing the names of the ten
avataras to the neophytes, the sevenfold system would seem to hold good, for the
last three degrees above referred to actually belong to initiations of so lofty
a character that the human mind has difficulty in grasping their esoteric
character. Hints have been given of three higher degrees than the seventh, but
so exquisite are these in spiritual refinement that it is for the highest and
most spiritualized of mankind to comprehend and hence to undertake the divine
initiations. Rare indeed are those who become avatara-like, Christ-like; rarer
still, &quot;as rare as are the flowers of the Udumbara-tree&quot; are the
Buddhas. As for the tenth and last -- such we can leave unmarred by description.</P>
