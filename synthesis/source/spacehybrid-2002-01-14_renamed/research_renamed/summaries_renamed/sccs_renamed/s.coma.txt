     Dear Jim:

          This message is only displayed to Level 1 members and is
     displayed every time a Level 1 member logs on and will n-o-t
     appear when you upgrade to Level 10, 50 or 100. The contents of
     this bulletin have been revised and you are encouraged to read it
     thoroughly.

          This message explains the privileges you get as a member of
     the Combat Arms BBS and how to expand those privileges. The
     information in this file is also available on the Bulletin Menu
     as Bulletin #19.

          In the interest of conserving disk space, all Level 1
     clients are automatically deleted from the records 30 days after
     they initially logged on unless they upgrade to Level 10, 50 or
     100.

          There are several things in this bulletin which will assist
     communications software in conjunction with the Non-Stop mode and
     study it at your leisure.

          The Combat Arms BBS has been in operation since December,
     1988 and is geared towards the person with an IBM or IBM
     compatible computer. The system has been set up to make it easy
     for you to use and is quite powerful.

          If you have a non-IBM compatible computer, you may still
     benefit from the Message Section. However, persons using non-IBM
     compatible computers will NOT generally be able to use any
     downloaded files with a ZIP extension. The ZIP files are archived
     files (currently using version 1.10 of Phil Katz's PKZIP
     rountine) and take up less physical space on the hard disk.
     Owners of non-IBM compatible computers will be able to download
     and read files that do not have the ZIP extension. There are very
     few of them on this BBS.

          The moral of the story is to either get an IBM compatible
     computer, buy a board for your non-IBM compatible system that
     will let it emulate an IBM or find some software that will
     unarchive ZIP files on your particular computer. Regrettably,
     with ZIP files. However, there is a file here for downloading
     called UNZIP.SIT that will help MAC owners unarchive ZIPped
     files.

          You are urged to go to the Message Menu and read the
     messages. The messages on the Combat Arms BBS are not "happy
     talk" messages like on other BBS systems. Here they generally are
     news items and more often than not relate to firearms news.
     Messages to/from you older than 30 days are, for the most part,
     deleted in the interest of conserving disk space. You are also
     encouraged to read the Bulletins. Some are rather interesting. A
     newsletter is provided that I update occasionally with pertinent
     materials.

          The system of upgrading on this BBS is setup to permit a new
     client to log onto the system as a Level 1 Access patron, explore
     it and, if the client so chooses, to upgrade to a higher Access
     Level (10, 50 and 100) at a fee. These fee paid levels are, in
     point of fact, what support the Combat Arms BBS. Level 1 access
     is FREE but the privileges of that access level are severely
     limited. Details on the different access levels follow.

          get when they first log onto the Combat Arms BBS. Holders of
          Level 1 Access are allowed 15 minutes per day access to the
          system, may read messages, read bulletins, upload files,
          report crimes (available for all callers, regardless of
          access level) and have it turned over to the appropriate
          authorities, etc. but may not download any files. However,
          the Level 1 customer may see a list of files put on the BBS
          within the past 365 days and available for downloading by
          examining Bulletin #20. This list is updated daily and may
          be "captured" by your comm software. I repeat, there is NO
          charge for Level 1 access. The purpose of Level 1 is to
          permit the new client to examine the system and determine if
          there is something here that he or she wishes to participate
          in. No permanent Level 1 Access will be possible. Again,
          please note that 30 days after logging on as a Level 1
          customer, you are automatically deleted from the system's
          records (unless you upgrade to Level 10, 50 or 100). This is
          to reduce the size of the user data file, which otherwise
          grows unnecessarily large.

     2.   The Level 10 Access is the second level and costs $25.00 per
          year. The Level 10 client is acknowledged to be primarily
          downloads per day and 45 minutes of access time (that is
          actually higher than the average Level 10 user downloads in
          one session or is logged on). Also forthcoming (hopefully in
          March, 1991) will be the availability of a Hayes 9600 baud
          modem.

     3.   The third Access Level is Level 50. Level 50 Access costs
          $40.00 per year. The privileges include 60 minutes per day
          access time, ECHO mail privileges, 20 downloads per day,
          access to a shopping-by-BBS section (currently being
          developed; it is a very slow process!) and healthy discounts
          of purchases of firearms and other items. Level 50 (and
          Level 100) clients may also special order firearms, subject
          to the usual legal restrictions.

     4.   The fourth Level is the life member Level 100 Access. This
          is a support access level and Level 100 supporters are
          granted co-sysop privileges, clearance for access to all
          privileges on the BBS and all of the privileges of lower
          levels. The fee for this is a o-n-e  t-i-m-e fee of $150.00.
          The Level 100 status is important to you if you desire the
          maximum amount of privileges and want to help expand the
          facilities of the Combat Arms BBS.

          Payment for membership may be made in the form of cash,
     check, money order or by Visa, MasterCard, American Express,
     Carte Blanche, Diner's Club or Discover Card. If paying by credit
     card, please include your access level desired, full name,
     complete street address, city, state, zip code, telephone number
     with area code, credit card number (and type) and expiration
     date. Also note that there is a 5% handling charge on credit card
     payments for Level 10 and 50 (amounts under $100.00). There is no
     sales tax on upgrading. You may also leave a message to the SysOp
     (select the Comments to the SysOp option from the Main Menu)
     giving your credit card number, etc. You will be upgraded the
     following business day. A receipt for credit card purchases will
     be mailed to you.

          If paying by money order or personal check, send the
     appropriate payment for upgrading to:

                         Combat Arms BBS
                         2869 Grove Way
                         Castro Valley, CA 94546

          In summary, here are the different levels of access and some
     of what they provide:

     Level 1   0 downloads per day                           15 minutes
     Level 10  5 downloads per day up to 1 megabyte          45 minutes
     Level 50  20 d'loads per day up to 3 megabytes          60 minutes
     Level 100 999 d'loads per day up to 10 megabytes       240 minutes

               Level 10 Access  =  $25.00 per year fee.
               Level 50 Access  =  $40.00 per year fee.
               Level 100 Access = $150.00 one time fee (Life membership)

          As far as the maintenance necessary on this BBS, I alone do
     that because I want no one else fiddling with the user database,
     the file database or the message database. Too many cooks foul
     things up. That would be especially annoying since I would have
     to be the person to fix it. In addition to being the owner of
     Combat Arms, SysOp of the BBS, husband, grandfather, etc, I am
     also a graduate student in the Master's in Public Administration
     program at California State University (Hayward), so there is
     simply no time available for fixing errors that result when more
     than one person has access to the file and user database.
     Additionally, in the interests of preserving the BBS and also in
     maintaining the security of the clients, their addresses, etc.,
     only I will have access to that information.

          You may find it interesting to note that there is NO
     requirement on the Combat Arms BBS that you e-v-e-r upload
     anything. Unless it is an important and recent file (and pertains
     to firearms, ballistics, reloading, gun law, science, math or
     aviation), I would prefer that you did n-o-t upload it. However,
     if you wish to upload a TEXT file pertinent to firearms, law,
     aviation, mathematics, science, etc. p-l-e-a-s-e read Bulletin
     #28 BEFORE you upload it. There you will find the details on the
     specific format required and tips for easing the job. Disk space
     is a precious commodity. Therefore, do not upload a-n-y general
     purpose utilities, communications software packages, BBS software
     packages or word processing materials unless you check with me
     first. I would rather the disk space was consumed by firearms,
     gun law and aviation related files.

          I hope this has helped you better understand the thinking
     here and I look forward to receiving your Level 10, 50 or 100
     membership payment. Together, you and I can do great things! Hope
     to hear from you soon, Jim.

1.   What is "ballistics"?
     a.   A science which studies projectiles in motion.
          [1]  Interior ballistics - The study of events that occur inside
               the gun from the time the weapon is fired until the bullet
               leaves the muzzle end of the barrel.

          [2]  Exterior ballistics - The study of the motion of a
               projectile after it leaves the barrel of the weapon.

2.   Why is the study of ballistics important to a street police officer?
     a.   It can be lifesaving knowledge and greatly aids an investigation.
          The information will also make you a better witness in court and
          a better shot on the range.

3.   Definitions.
     a.   Bullet.
          [1]  The projectile that is shot from the barrel of the weapon.
               It is normally composed of lead and may be surrounded
               completely or in part by a covering called a "jacket."
               Bullet types vary according to the shooting need. The common
               ones are described below.

          [2]  Full metal jacket (FMJ) or full metal case (FMC) bullets
               have thick, tough coverings variously made of copper,
               nickel, silver, brass or even clad steel. The terms FMJ and
               FMC are identical.

          [3]  Jacketed hollow point (JHP) are either jacketed to the tip
               of the hollow point by a copper jacket or they may be
               jacketed just half way up the bullet with lead exposed the
               remainder, in which case they are called "semi-jacketed
               hollow points." The depth of the hollow point is important
               to its expansion ability. In the past these were called "dum
               dum" bullets (after a plant in India where they were
               originally made). Hollow point bullets are the ones normally
               carried by police officers. A hollow point bullet peels back
               at the hollow point much like a banana, thereby exposing a
               greater cross-sectional area and causing more tissue damage
               as the bullet moves through the target. A good hollow point,
               such as the Winchester Silvertips, expand in diameter up to
               160% of their original size. A .357 bullet is actually
               0.358" in diameter and 160% of this is 0.5728" in diameter.
               As you will see when we later get into caliber, this is now
               a bullet that is bigger in diameter than a .50 caliber
               machine gun round! That is exactly what you want.

          [4]  Wadcutter bullets have no pointed cone to them and are flush
               with the top of the case. They are commonly used in target
               practice because, by virtue of their design, they make a
               very neat, clean circle in the target. That makes for easier
               scoring. They are usually sold in the form of reloads and
               are comparatively inexpensive, costing 1/2 to 1/3 the price
               of a factory assembled FMJ round. The bullet is made
               entirely of a lead and antimony (antimony is used to make
               the bullet harder) mixture and has no jacket.

          [5]  Semi-wadcutter bullets are more conical, thus making it
               substantially easier to use a speedloader with them when
               reloading a revolver. They are made entirely of lead and
               antimony. I see a lot of police officers who mistakenly
               believe that it is smart to hand load their own bullets and
               use semi-wadcutters but install them backwards in the
               mistaken belief that it is a more effective round. If you
               are doing this now or have a friend considering it, please
               don't. Instead, see item a[3] on the previous page regarding
               Winchester Silvertips.

          [6]  Specialty bullets include armor piercing, incendiary, Glaser
               Safety Slugs, rifled lead one ounce slugs for use in
               shotguns, shot shells for use in handguns, and tracers. It
               would be rare to see most of these in the hands of a
               civilian. Note that while armor piercing handguns rounds and
               all incendiary rounds are illegal in California, they are
               commonly available through less than legal sources.
               Experience indicates that criminals seldom have the
               ingenuity to obtain these rounds. Glaser Safety Slugs are
               available and may be the most potent round available to
               civilians.

     b.   Bullet weight.
          [1]  Measured in grains.

          [2]  There are 7,000 grains to one avoirdupois (pronounced
               "av-wah-doo-pwah") pound. The avoirdupois pound is the one
               we use in the United States with 16 ounces or 453.59 grams
               to one pound.

          [3]  The bullets used by law enforcement agencies in handguns are
               typically 85 to 240 grains. Rifle bullets weigh between 55
               and 168 grains in police use. The heavier rifle bullets are
               usually match grade quality.

     c.   Caliber.
          [1]  A measure of a bullet's diameter in inches.

          [2]  A .45 caliber bullet is theoretically 45/100 inches in
               diameter at its widest point (actually 0.451").

          [3]  The international method of describing bullet diameter is in
               millimeters (abbreviated "mm").

          [4]  There are 25.4 millimeters to one inch.
          [5]  Handgun ammunition specified in millimeters that police
               officers should be familiar with are the 9mm Luger (also
               called 9mm Parabellum or 9 x 19mm) and the new 10mm bullet
               used in the Colt Delta Elite and Smith & Wesson 1006.

          [6]  There are three modern rifle cartridges that are designated
               in millimeters. These are the 5.56mm (equal to the .223
               caliber and used today in the Ruger Mini-14 and the Colt
               M-16/AR-15), the 7.62x39mm (used in the Soviet AK-47 and
               equal in diameter to .308 caliber), and the 7.62x51mm
               cartridge. The 7.62x51mm is the international NATO
               designation of America's .308 round.

          [7]  On millimeter designated rifle (and a few pistol)
               cartridges, the diameter is separated from the case length
               by a times sign ("x"). Thus, the 7.62x51mm is read as "7.62
               by 51" and means the bullet diameter is 7.62mm and the brass
               or case is 51mm in length. Sometimes you may hear the
               7.62x39mm cartridge called the "7.62 Russian short" since
               the Soviets also have a 7.62x54mm rifle cartridge.

     d.   Cartridge.
          [1]  This is the entire assembly of the bullet, case, powder, and
               primer. It is sometimes termed a "round." You may also hear
               the term "round" used to describe just the bullet itself,
               such as "let's go shoot some rounds" or a "9mm round."

     e.   Case.
          [1]  Also called "brass" or a "cartridge case." For handguns and
               rifles, the case is normally made of metal and there are
               some training rounds made of plastic and one target shooting
               revolver round made with reusable plastic cases.

     f.   Gunpowder.
          [1]  Today it's called "smokeless powder" and is a mixture
               comprised of various substances which, when ignited, produce
               a tremendous volume of gases. The powder is more technically
               termed an accelerant or propellant rather than an explosive
               mixture. Like bullets, powder is measured by weight in
               grains with 7,000 grains to a pound.

     g.   Primer.
          [1]  This is a small cup located in the base of the case that
               contains an explosive compound. The primer detonates when
               struck by the firing pin and ignites the powder mixture in
               the case. Cartridges which have these cup primers are called
               "centerfire" cartridges, as contrasted with a rimfire
               cartridge like a .22 long rifle (.22LR) caliber cartridge.
               There is a slang term whereby the phrase "let's go pop some
               caps" actually means to detonate some primers but street
               people, not nuclear physicists by any means, use the phrase
               to refer to discharging some rounds.

          [2]  The primers used in the United States are called Boxer
               primers while those used in ammunition manufactured in
               Europe are called Berdan primers. The modern primers used a
               compound called lead styphnate as the explosive mixture.

4.   What happens when the weapon is fired?
     a.   Aft movement of the trigger releases the cocked hammer.
          [1]  On double action handguns the initial aft movement of the
               trigger also serves to move the hammer aft. At some point in
               the pull of the trigger the hammer is released from an
               engagement hook on the sear and then the hammer is permitted
               to move forward.

     b.   The hammer moves forward and strikes the firing pin.
          [1]  On some weapons, such as the Smith & Wesson revolvers, the
               hammer has the firing pin built into it. Then the firing pin
               movement follows the hammer.
          [2]  On revolvers such as the Colt Python, the hammer does not
               have a built-in firing pin. In this case the hammer first
               strikes a metal "transfer" bar and the impact of the hammer
               upon the transfer bar is transferred to the firing pin.

     c.   The firing pin contacts the primer that is located in the bottom
          of the cartridge case.

     d.   Within the primer itself the barium, lead, and antimony mixture
          that makes up the lead styphnate primer explodes, generating a
          high temperature mixture.

     e.   This high temperature mixture ignites the gunpowder.
          [1]  The powder burns at a predetermined rate and produces very
               large quantities of gas, which radically increase the
               pressure within the cartridge case to as much as 50,000
               pounds per square inch (psi), depending upon the caliber.

     f.   The high pressure gases within the cartridge case literally push
          the bullet out of the case and into the "rifled" barrel.
          [1]  The rifling in the barrel is nothing more than a precise set
               of grooves cut into the inside of the barrel.

          [2]  As the bullet travels from the breech end of the barrel
               towards the outlet of the barrel (called the "muzzle"), it
               is rotated within the barrel by this rifling. This spinning
               gives the bullet gyroscopic stability.

          [3]  The rifling leaves an impression of itself upon the bullet's
               surface. This impression can later be used by a crime
               laboratory technician to determine if that particular bullet
               was fired from a specific firearm. Rifling is therefore used
               much like fingerprints by the crime lab.

          [4]  The spinning of the bullet by the rifling will cause the
               bullet to be more stable in flight once it leaves the
               barrel.

     g.   As soon as the bullet leaves the barrel it is immediately acted
          upon by the forces of gravity (pulling the bullet Earthward and
          causing "bullet drop") and aerodynamic drag (which slows the
          bullet's velocity).
          [1]  A bullet's velocity is measured in feet per second (fps) at
               several locations away from the weapon. When the velocity is
               measured at the muzzle itself, it is termed "muzzle
               velocity." The muzzle is where the bullet exits the barrel.

5.   Kinetic energy.
     a.   Kinetic energy (KE) is a useful measure of that nebulous term
          "stopping power" in a well placed shot.
          [1]  Technically, KE is a measure of energy in motion.

          [2]  KE is measured in units called foot-pounds (ft-lbs).

          [3]  KE can be mathematically computed using the formula:

                              KE = ´mV˝

                              where:
                                             Bullet weight in grains
                                        m =       7000 x 32.1746

                                        V =  Velocity of the projectile in
                                             fps and normally measured at
                                             the muzzle end of the barrel.
                                             Note that this quantity is
                                             squared.

                                        32.1746 = Acceleration due to
                                                  gravity

     b.   Why is kinetic energy important to a police officer?
          [1]  The formula tells us that the only two ways to increase the
               kinetic energy of a bullet is to either increase its mass
               (m) by selecting a heavier bullet or to make the bullet go
               faster by increasing the powder charge (increasing the value
               of V).

          [2]  Increased velocities are obtained in police rounds that are
               designated as a "+P" or "+P+" type (pronounced "plus pee or
               plus pee plus"). What this means is that there is simply
               more powder in the case and that results in higher
               pressures, which subsequently push the bullet at a greater
               velocity. The higher velocity helps hollow point bullets to
               expand better upon contact with a human target.

     c.   Keep in mind that it is better to hit a bad guy in the eye with a
          .22 caliber bullet than in the foot with a .44 Magnum JHP. In the
          final analysis, the secret is shot placement and that only comes
          from practice, practice, and more practice!

          Through the research efforts of numerous Combat Arms BBS
     users, several SysOps on the National Firearms Echo and countless
     readers of the Firearms and RTKBA Echoes, to all of whom I am
     eternally grateful, dozens of firearms related bulletin boards
     have been located around the United States.  As of the date
     listed below these boards have been verified to carry a local
     firearms echo, the National Firearms Echo, the Right to Keep and
     Bear Arms (RTKBA) Echo, the USENET firearms Echo or support a
     firearms file base.

          New and changed listings since the last time this material
- More - [C]ontinue, [S]top, [N]onStop: n                                                        was posted to the Firearms and RTKBA Echoes are designated by an
     asterisk (*) following the telephone number.  Also note that when
     a listing is provided, the clients on my BBS and others w-i-l-l
     call it to verify that it is up and running.  When I get a report
     from them that it is not, the listing is immediately deleted.

          The format of this filename on the Combat Arms BBS is
     GUNBBSxx.DOC and the archived version will be GUNBBSxx.ZIP.  The
     "xx" characters will be a number from 1 to 99.  The higher the
     number, the later the revision.  This will also benefit the
     SysOps you upload GUNBBSxx.ZIP to because they can now tell which
     versions are obsolete and can be safely deleted from their board.

          How often does a revision appear?  Approximately the end of
     every month I upload the latest revision to the Firearms Echo and
     the RTKBA Echo.  The moderator of those two Echoes, Bob Kohl, has
     authorized the postings.  However, the file GUNBBSxx.ZIP on the
     Combat Arms BBS may change more often than once per month if you,
     the user, send me new material for the list.  For those without
     downloading privileges, the absolute latest information is still
     available on the Combat Arms BBS by logging on and reading or
     capturing Bulletin #8.  Bulletin #8 reflects every change.  When
     several changes are accumulated, the GUNBBSxx.ZIP file is
     changed.  Again, watch the file date, the revision number and go
     to the File Menu and check for the New Files since you last
     logged on to see if GUNBBSxx.ZIP has been revised.  Fido SysOps
     are encouraged to File Request the file with the "magic" name
     GUNBBS for the latest edition from us (1:161/357).

          Please do what you can to help in this project and call
     these boards!  Share files that you like and downloaded from the
     Combat Arms BBS with them.  Also, please do not forget to upload
     files to the Combat Arms BBS that you locate elsewhere!

          If you find new bulletin boards that carry firearms
     materials or discover that any of the bulletin boards listed
     below are out of service, etc., please leave me a note and I will
     update the list.  Thank you.

                 A BALLISTICS PROGRAM AT DREXEL UNIVERSITY


          The following material was provided by Ed Harris in the
     Firearms Echo. Should any reader contact Drexel University and
     wish to provide the entirety of their brochure, I will replace
     this material with that. Thank you.

           There have been requests in the past from students
     interested in ballistics who wanted to know where they could take
     college level courses which would be useful in the field. I
     received through the American Defense Preparedness Assn. a flier
     on the Center for Ballistics at Drexel University, 32nd and
     Chestnut Streets, Philadelphia, PA 19104. I have extracted the
     following from the flier, which I have edited here for brevity:

           Full time students may receive an MS in Mechanical
     Engineering with a concentration in ballistics by taking the
     required courses in the Mechanical Engineering Department while
     selecting specialized ballistics courses as electives. Students
     wishing to enter this program should have a BS degree in the
     sciences or engineering and must meet the requirements of
     Drexel's MS program. Beginning the 1990/91 academic year the
     ballistics courses will be offered in the Spring and Summer
     terms. Each term is approximately six weeks. A total of 45
     credits (15 courses for the non-thesis option) are required for
     the MS degree.

           Three math courses in Engineering Analysis (statistics) or
     Engineering Mathematics are required, plus the following six
	 courses in the Mechanical Engineering core curriculum:

                    Theory of Elasticity     I and II
                    Fluid Mechanics          I and II
                    Advanced Dynamics        I and II

           For the ballistics courses students may elect from any six
     of the following:
     Impact and Wave Propagation I and II:

           Governing equations of elastic waves, longitudinal and
     transverse waves, Bernouli-Euler and Timosh enko beams; spherical
     and cylindrical waves, method of characteristics. Instructor Dr.
     Pei Chi Chou. Co-author of Elasticity and Material Response to
     Impulsive Loading, Dr. Chou has over 25 years experience in
     researching shaped charge, penetration mechanics and computer
     simulation of terminal ballistics.

     Compressible Fluid Dynamics:

           Steady flow of compressible fluids, review of
     one-dimensional flows; two and three dimensional subsonic,
     transonic, supersonic and hypersonic flow, normal and oblique
     shock waves, wave reflections, oblique shock wave interactions
     and generation of vorticity, compressible boundary layers, shock
     boundary layer interaction. Instructor Dr. Turner (No bio
     furnished).

     Experimental Ballistics:

           Introduction to interior, transitional, exterior and
     terminal ballistics, ballistic range technology, standard and
     experimental ballistics of kinetic energy penetrators, armors and
     explosive testing, loading technique, standard operating
     procedures and test design and specifications. Instructor, Luigi
     F. Baldini BS, formerly of the US Army Armament Research,
     Development and Engineering Center, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ, with
     over 25 years experience in the areas of interior ballistics of
     high velocity propellant artillery, launch and terminal
     ballistics of KE penetrators, range and high pressure gun design
     and operation.

     Shaped Charge Technology:

           Introduction to shaped charges, explosive metal
     interaction, jet formation theory, jet instability and break-up,
     incompressible and compressible penetration theories,
     one-dimensional models and two-dimensional hydrocones. Instructor
     Dr. William J. Flis, Director of Research, Dyna East Corp.,
     Philadelphia, PA., author of the latest version of DESC codes for
     predicting shaped charge jet formation and penetration.

     Physics of Explosives:

           Shock waves and detonation waves; basic definitions; types
     of military explosives; measures of performance, sensitivity and
     vulnerability; explosive trains; hazard classification and
     insensitive munitions criteria. Instructor Dr. Robert B. Frey,
     Chief, Explosives Effects Branch, Terminal Ballistics Division,
     U.S. Army Ballistic Research Laboratory, Aberdeen Proving Ground,
     MD. Dr. Frey has done extensive research on transverse wave
     phenomena in detonating explosives, ignition and initiation
     phenomena in explosives and propellants, shaped charge warhead
     performance and reactive armor. He is the author or co-author od
     48 technical reports and papers on these topics and the recipient
     of two US Army Achievement Awards.

                                   -----
           Please don't ask ME questions about these subjects, because
     they are over MY head for the most part. However, for those who
     are serious and have the determination to pursue it, the above
     shows you what the academic requirements are. Sure is more than
     handloading and playing with guns isn't it?
