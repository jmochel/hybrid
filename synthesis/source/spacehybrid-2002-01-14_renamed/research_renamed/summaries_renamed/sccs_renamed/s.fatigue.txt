Hi Folks,
	Here is some quick detail about fatigue and exhaustion followed 
        by some ideas I have about how to model it. 

People typically have a basal(at rest) metabolic rate of 70 cal/hr. Humans
typically take in enough oxygen for 90 cal/hr.a minute. As a person becomes
more active the body tends to balance the oxygen intake with the actual 
energy expenditures. The continues up until the persons activity gos beyond
a brisk walk. At that point the body's efforts to counter the energy 
expenditures with oxygen intake are no longer completely successful and
so the body makes use of a stored pool of energy called the oxygen reserve. 
This pool is roughly 75 calories in size. 

Once you go beyond the so-called normal levels of activity up into
the super-normal activitys (jogging, running, sprinting) energy starts
to come from the reserve to the point where a 100 meter dash is an almost
aerobic activity since O2 intake cannot even begin to balance out the 
energy costs. When the reserve is depleted the person displays all the 
symptoms we have come to know as exhausted.

Once the activity has ended the body continues to labor to refill the
reserve. Usually about 90% of the depeleted energies have been returned
inside a period of three minutes. Of course, this ignores the muscle fatigue
that is also a by product of the work performed. 

I intend to model this in a fairly simple manner in the beginning.
I will create a stat called Physical EXhaustion or PEX. This stat will
average about 75 points. Most lighter activities will expend PFT and 
expending 10 PFT will expend 1 PEX. The heavier activitys such as running
and so on will directly expend PEX, with all the culmulative modifiers 
implied by exhaustion. 

The values for energy and PEX expenditure are below for joe average:

Action                  PEX or Calories cost
CRAWL (.5m/sec)         -
WALK  (1m/sec)          -
JOG (2m/sec)            1 PEX/min
RUN (4m/sec)            6 PEX/min
DASH (8m/sec)           2 PEX/sec

The only problem with this is that , if I were designing strictly to model
reality I would have most of the PEX return in 3 or 4 minutes and have 
a seperate model for muscle fatigue. The very concept scares me. What I 
was thinking instead was  that I would assume that muscle fatigue and 
energy fatigue (as modeled above ) would proceed at the same rate and thus
PEX would be an effective representation of the OVERALL fatigue of the 
character. I would then let the person get back their PEX at a rate closer
to the rate at which muscle fatigue returns than currently.

Comments, Suggestions, Flames.
