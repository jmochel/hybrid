Hiya guys,

For all you guys interested in martial arts, there's someone on the Vampires
game list that is making MA rules, thought I'd pass along a bit of it to pique
your interest (or scorn *hah*)

	Got to thinking about oriental vampires the other day, decided to put my experience to work and come up with a martial arts system for this game.

	I wanted something that would spook your average PC when he first gets
knocked silly from a mortal's kick to the head, but not something that is so
powerfull that it becomes a focus of the game.  (ie unless you've got some form of Karate, your dead meat).  Here's what I came up with.  I probably won't try it out too soon, so I don't have any feedback or knowlege of how it will work.

	Gonna send it seperate.

	I've been thinking that some gangrel should have a from of Martial arts. You know lerning form nature (like Bando or Some Kung fu styles, but havent' really put any of that into concrete yet.)

			MARTIAL ARTS FOR VAMP.

	This si not not a Perfect realistic system.  I don't wnt it to be. 
What I wanted was to make normal humans who were good fighters give Vampyres a
bit of a work out.  On the other hand, I didn't want to let Characters or NPC's 
who had Specialties in Martial arts walk all over those who didn't.  I think
this is balanced to the point where it works but isn't overbalanced.  I haven't
playtested any of it, but if you want to use what I came up with, here ya go.

	I run it like this.  When a player get his brawl up to three dots and
picks his specialty in a Martial art, he gains some neat stuff.  I do this
mainly for detail.  I don't want a Trained Boxer facing off with a Gangrel who
learned to fight with Grizzly bear and both of them fighting the same.

	Most of these skills take some time to learn and I would not let a
player aquire four dots in Brawl(Judo) in three weeks.

			COMMON MARTIAL ARTS (for USA)

KARATE:  Karate includes all "hard style" martial arts.  Styles like
Ishin-rhyu, Shotokan, Gojo-ryu, American Freestyle, and Wado-ryu all get
grouped under Karate (for simplicity, if you want to seperate 'em go a head)
	... Powerfull techniques.  Characters with a Karate specialty and three
		dots may add one extra die to their damage pools for punches
and kicks only.
	.... Determined mind.  Through discipline and hard work, you have
learned to control your thought better.  Add one to your Willpower pool.
	..... Pain resistence.  You have learned to take blows that would floor
your average person.  You resist Damage with Stamina + 4 instead of +3.
(I'm not sure if this is potent enough. maybe to much so.)

KUNG FU: Kung Fu includes all "Soft Style" martial arts.  The difference
between hard and soft styles is that a hard style tends to blocck and soft
styles tend to divert your opponents attack.  This is a very basic wy of
seperating them.  You will probably tick off many stylists if you tell them
this, but this definition will work for game purposes.  Very few styles can be
strictly classified as hard or soft, but here, they all get file somewhere. 
Kung fu includes Kung fu(surprise), Tai-chi, Chineese Kempo, etc.
	... Flexibility: you may kick as high as your height +10%  Gain +1 die
to rolls requiring flexibility and balance.
	.... Catlike: The complex locking blocks and movements of Kung fu make
it very difficult to hit it's experienced pratitioner.  Anyone attacking you is
automatically considered to have one 1(botch) in his die pool.  In other words,
they must accumulate at least two successes to hit you.  (Meele and Brawl only. 
You aren't quite fast enough to dodge bullets)
	..... Full Coordination:  You can use both arms and one leg
simultaneous against multiple attackers.  Your Brawling attack may affect up to
three people (all must be within arms reach, and all may defend).  You may not
attack three times.  You just roll one attack and apply it to all three of your
opponants.

WRESTLING:  This is american wrestling.  If you want to put Sumo in here or WWF
(boy, that would be an odd campaign) feel free to do so, but I did not have
them in mind when I came up with this.
	... Know lots of neat holds: Grappeling difficulty is five, instead of
 six
	.... Know lots of neat escapes: If you are grappeled, you may
automatically loosen one level of hold per round.  This is in addition to any
you can accumulate through normal rules.  If your opponant "Knows lots of neat
escapes" as well, this does not work.  (or optionally, you make a contest of
skill to see.)  Wrestlers, given time, can squirm out of about anything.  Your
opponant may continue to grapple you, accumulating successes.
	..... Break fall:  you may roll your Dex+brawl to soak Damage from
throws and grapples only.  (Kindred with this skill do not get two soak rolls. 
The may try Stamina+fortitude or Dex+Brawl if they are thrown.  not both.)

JUDO:  I seperated this from wrestling namely because Judoka are tough chokes
while Wrestlers are not.
	... as wrestling
	.... Choke: Choke is a seperate attack diff 7.  It works like
grappeling except that every round a choke is applied the opponant must make a
Stamina check.  the difficulty is The number of successes accumulated + The
number of rounds that the choke has been in affect.  You must realease a
grapple to apply a choke. (Remember, Kindred do not breath or need blood
vessels.  If you wrap your arms around one's throat, you may be in for quite a
surprise)
	..... Break fall: as Wrestling

BOXING:  Probably the only reason Mike Tyson isn't a Kindred combat monster by
now, is that most of them are probably afraid of him.
	... The old one two:  You may punch twice per round.  The first puch
does 1/2 damage (round up).
	.... Powerful Techniques: as Karate, but punches only.
	..... Thick skulled:  The scariest thing about boxers, is the fact that
they don't seem to feel any pain.  These are guys that get punched in the head
for a half-hour and like it.  In game terms, they may ignore pain (as a frenzy)
if they make a willpower check.  The difficulty is the number of levels 
lost + 4.

TAE KWON DO: Rare for a while, this is gaining popularity in the US.  
	... Flexibility:  as kung fu
	.... Powerful techniques: as Karate but kick only. (There are punches
in Tae Kwon Do, but the emphasis is definately on kicking)
	..... Double jump kick:  neat looking manuever.  effectively works like
The boxers Old one two, just with kicks.

			UNUSUAL STYLES

	Theses are styles not usually found in the US, hard to learn, or just
too neat to be easy for charachters to get.  Characters must have good reason
to get these specialties

Aikido:  Stephen Seagal uses a hybrid version of Aikido.  It is a very young
martial art (founded less than one hundred years ago by Moriai uehshiba) it is
part anatomy, part physics, part Jujitsu, and part waltz.  If you ever see it
in action, it looks very staged and very fake.  It also takes forever to learn.
	... Catlike: as kungfu
	.... Joint locks: Special attack.  dif 8. Successe (even a single one),
means opponant is imobilized. (one of their joint is twisted into some very
unnatural position, they are off balance and the Akidoist is standing where
they can't reach them).  Dmg is inflicted by using Intelligence + Successes + 1
	..... Break fall: as wrestling
	Akido is a very defensive art.  If a character specializes in Aikido,
they may not use this skill to punch or kick.  Only grapple, throw, or lock. 
Learning Aikido (to three dots) takes at least a year and requires and
inteligence of three and a medicine (anatomy) of one.

JEET KUN DO: Bruce Lee's style.  This is a hybrid of Chineese kung fu and
anything that bruce lee thought might hurt some one.  It means The way of the
intercepting fist.  Jeet Kun DO's philosophy is beating your opponant to the
punch.  It relies on speed and can be very brutal.  Jeet Kun Do "Masters" are
almost as common as Ninjitsu "Masters" and usually about as credible.  There
are some practitioners around.
	... Fast and alert: gain two automatic success on intiative rolls (only
if you are brawling)
	.... Intercepting fist:  You have learned to attack and counter
simultaneously.  As Catlike but with two successes.
	..... Bloody Quick: Effective Celerity of 1 (for brawling only) 
	Jeet Kun Do is very over balanced.  But it should be VERY rare in a
campaign.  I would probably charge extra xp for it.  Come to think of it, I
would probably do the same for Aikido.  Pre-Requisits: Wits 3, Dex 3

TAI KICK BOXING:  VERY VERY Brutal sport.  Tai Kick boxers have an average
career of one year. At the end of this year they usually retire due to
injuries.  They train six days a week and fight on the seventh.  They do not
use gloves like there american counterparts.  They use fist, feet, head,
elbows, and knees to batter their opponants into submission.
	... Knee:  usually to the groin area, can be targetted to the head with
a hop.  This is a practiced and powerful technique.  Don't let your average
knee to the groin do this.  Diff 5, damage Str + 1
	.... Thick skulled: as boxing
	..... Quick healing:  you regain 2 wound levels per day instead of 1.
(Sorry, kindred.  Not you)
	Pre requisits: Stamina 4, willpower 7, Love of bruises.

Hmm..  I had thought about re-doing the "brawling" skill myself.. but
that was when my ST was saying that the skill roll was "str + brawl",
which made no sense to me at all.. once we got to "dex + brawl, but str
for damage", I said "still not perfect, but close enough for a non-combat
game".

I don't agree with all that you did for implimenting your martial arts
system.. and I should probably formulate a long and drawn out way of doing
it.. Mine was based heavily upon the one in Cyberpunk 2.0.2.0.

Basically, certain arts get bonuses with certain moves, and not others
(I extended the list of maneuvers in hand to hand combat).  There was one
thing that I specifically didn't like about yours, and that's how you
handled Aikido.  I myself am an Aikidoka (though, out of practice)..
in order to do Aikido justice, you have to change a lot of things.. 

For example, damage ought to be based upon how many dice the threw at you,
not upon any of your own traits (in aikido, you can only hurt the guy as
much as he intended to hurt you.. because his energy and momentum do a lot
to determin what counters you can use on him).  Also, there ARE kicks in
aikido.. but they're mostly 'unbalacing' as opposed to 'impact' oriented
(if you're comming at me, and I do a rising kick to your upper chest,
your torso will move backwards, but your legs keep moving forwards.. and you
fall on your butt).

I'll print yours up, look it over some more, and try to remember what mine
was.. and I'll try to get it back to you.. tomorrow (saturday).. 
(btw: not to say I'm any more qualified in the martial arts than yourself,
but I have studied Shito-ryu Karate, Aikido, Hapkido, and a long time ago
I was in a kung fu class whose style I don't remember [LONG time ago]..
which is just to say that I've got exposure to a lot of different forms
of martial arts)...

oh.. and I thought your definition of hard-vs-soft was a little off..

but anyways, I'll send more later.

John
