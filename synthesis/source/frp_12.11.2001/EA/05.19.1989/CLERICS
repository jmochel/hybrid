    The clerical orders of EA often resemble the Knights militant of the
Middle Ages. They are well trained in the devotional way and fighting
aspect ( if any ) of their deity. Most clerics have a limited number of
attack spells. Clerical spells draw upon the ambient power of their deity
or his minions. A cleric usually casts with his holy symbol as a focus.
Rarely will a Cleric's use of spells attract or require the attention of
his Diety. Such attention can usually be gained in only the following
ways: 

1.  Casting a spell that specifically requires the deity's attention.

2.  A request for divine intervention. The aid gained thus is usually
minimal and requires payback. The gods are very lazy.

    " Be careful what you pray for, you may get your wish"

3.  The energetic opposition of several clerics is a good beacon for
attention , if rarely for divine action. 

A cleric gains the knowledge and ability from his deity at the
consecration of the cleric at each level. This includes spell knowledge
and special skills but not combat skills.

1. There is no spell breakdown except for extra spells as granted by
advanced wisdom bonuses. 

2. 1 & 2nd level spells need not be memorized.

Clerical CURE LIGHT spells heal 1d8 + 1

CURE SERIOUS will cut down the healing time of broken bones by half. 

CURE CRITICAL WOUNDS will restore broken bones and restore damage from
most internal injuries. 

Clerical healing will have 1/2 effect on the damage caused by trey wights
and black unicorns.  Only druids and moonsingers may have full effect on
such injuries.  

Note that a cleric may choose to "throw" the resurrection and subtract 30%
from the character's survival roll.  this may bring a cleric into
contention with his deity if not done with good reason.
