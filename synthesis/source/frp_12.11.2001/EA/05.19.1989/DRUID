         DRUIDS GAIN THEIR POWER FROM THEIR BELIEF IN THE EARTH MOTHER
         GAEA AND HER GOODWILL. TO A GREAT EXTENT THEY BELIEVE THAT
         THIS GOODWILL IS MANIFESTED BY THE PLANTS AND TREES OF EA. TO
         A MUCH LESSER EXTENT THEY BELIEVE THAT ANIMAL LIFE (NOT
         HUMANOID) IS ALSO AN EXAMPLE OF GAEA'S GOODWILL.

                A DRUID'S SHAPECHANGE REQUIRES ONE SEGMENT AND MISTLE
         TOE TO PERFORM. THE TYPE OF MISTLETOE USED GOVERNS THE AMOUNT
         OF HIT POINTS GAINED BACK.


         DRUIDS HAVE A SUSTAINED SPEAK WITH PLANTS ( 3RD LEVEL + ) AND
         ONLY A RUDIMENTARY SPEAK WITH ANIMALS: W/O THE USE OF THAT
         SPELL.
                EXCEPTIONS: WOLVES TALK TO WHOMEVER THEY PLEASE.


         1. THERE IS NO SPELL BREAKDOWN EXCEPT FOR EXTRA SPELLS AS
         GRANTED BY ADVANCED WISDOM BONUSES.

         2. 1 & 2ND LEVEL SPELLS NEED NOT BE MEMORIZED.
