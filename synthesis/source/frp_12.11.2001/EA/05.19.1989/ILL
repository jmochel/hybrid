         1.     No spell level breakdown

         2.     Intell does not limit the # of spells one can learn
                but it does limit the % chance of comprehension


                                   ILLUSION:
         ------------------------------------------------------------
              ALL ILLUSION SPELLS ARE AREA BASED BUT MIND AFFECTING.
         THUS, MOST ILLUSIONS NEED NOT BE SEEN OR HEARD IN ORDER TO
         HAVE AN EFFECT. ERGO A SILENT PHAN FORCE WOULD AFFECT A BLIND
         MAN.
              ANY NPC EXPOSED TO AN ILLUSION FOR ONE ROUND OR MORE
         MUST ROLL 4D6 VS INTELL TO DETERMINE IF HE IS SUSPICIOUS. IF
         SUCH IS THE CASE HE THEN ROLLS A ST VS MENTAL MAGIC.
              THIS LENDS POWER TO FAST EFFECT SPELLS.

         ILLUSIONARY FIGHTERS ATTACK AS PER LEVEL OF ILLUSIONIST BUT
         ST'S VS THIS TYPE OF ILLUSION ARE FAIRLY EASY
         THROUGH. + 2 TO ST, -3 TO SUSPICION ROLL. AS FOLLOWS:
