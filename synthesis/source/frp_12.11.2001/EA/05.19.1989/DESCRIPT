planes related to the plane of interest called the prime material plane.  

^BThe Solar system:^b
     The star is a single sun of the white dwarf form. There are three
moons in near circular orbits. None of the moons can support life. The
moons are Litaha,Yrtha,Yamen. 
 
^BThe World of Ea:^b
     The world itself is a heavy grav planet with G=1.7 times that of Sol
III. The planet has 60% water coverage with one large continent and

^BThe Continent: ^b
     This is a fairly young planet. The mountains are very young and
fairly sharp. The crust is fairly well defined in its metal bearing
regions.  
     The south western area of the continent has many hot water geysers of
a fairly violent nature. Along with these geysers and springs comes a
wealth of mineral salts and heat based ores(cinnabar and copper sulfide).
There are some earthquakes here though they are rare and of low damage
potential. 
     To the north lies an area of some limited volcanic activity. The
Valtier ranges has several active volcanoes as does Osterland,Temoroth,and
the Kaylins. The mountains of Isig have only residual activity of this
sort. The southern Dwarvish ranges are almost devoid of volcanism . 
     The Northern most areas beyond the Isig range and east are without
any real mineral wealth. Yet there are many coal and water based
gemstones(amber) to be found here. 
 
^BThe Climates:^b
     The northern most area are artic tundra. The areas of Osterland and
Temoroth are similiar to Denmark and Finland. Felice and Canias display a
climate closer to the northern coast of Ireland. The belt of land between
Meremont and the Kaylins are identical to the North American continent.
The Shir has a climate like that of the Pacific Northwest. 
     Below the Kaylins the clime warms considerably. The plains are large
semi-arid and windy. The San-Sir area is even drier and warmer. Below the
dry and Tough Dwarvish mountains the land becomes a full fledged and
vicious desert with only the western coast having any respite from the
high heats and dry Sirriccos or Hershinas of the Kasan. 

^BThe Wildlife:^b
     The powers of natural mana are strong and because of this it is
unlikely that any of the fantastical creatures of the land will become
extinct. Dragons and Their ilk are unlikely to be pushed out by anything
as puny as man. The area of the Kaylins are a place where an armed dwarf
walks warily.
     The woods of Elhayns deep, fully consecrated in 200-1443 , are a
perfect refuge for many of the more scarce faery folk. 
     The plant life and woods of Ea are best covered elsewhere.
