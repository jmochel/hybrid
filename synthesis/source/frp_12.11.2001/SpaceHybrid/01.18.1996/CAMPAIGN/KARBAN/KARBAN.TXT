------Private----------------------------------------------------

Sir,
	I apologize for the death of the civilian and the damage done to 
the ship, the shuttle, and Harris' Marauder.  I acted in a overly
hasty, and badly planned manner.
	Kelly probably saved all the civies and my people by staying behind
in an environment that was probably fatal.  It would be a nice touch, and 
would help make him feel more part of the team- a good asset in a being of 
his power.
	I would like to file an informal complaint at being required to 
work with Darkover due to personality conflict(see REPORT: MISSION "CONTACT"|
CHAP4:34-42; see also MEMORANDUM: 673-8:MI\SUBJECT: "CIVILIAN INTERFERENCE
ACKNOWLEDGEMENT").  I believe Darkover and I have reached an agreement on
mission concerns, but cannot guarantee there will not be conflict.  I, of
course, will not provoke Marshall Darkover.  I AM aware of his skills, and 
acknowledge them.
	I, sir, would never dream of BUG HUNTING.  I will keep that in mind 
though,sir.
Karban 541
