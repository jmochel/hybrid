Good point.  I'd assumed (dangerous activity!) that we'd work our way into
modules after laying the groundwork, but I definitely agree, upon reflection,
that choosing an initial focus-module is a good and productive idea.  Guess
I'll have to wait a while longer for cyberpunk-esque functionality.  Ah well;
that's what compromise is for.
