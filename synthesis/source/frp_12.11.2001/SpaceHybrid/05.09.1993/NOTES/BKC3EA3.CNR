Con can be a number of things, all of which could be separate stats:

Short term endurance (sprinting)
Long tern endurance (hiking)
Drug tolerance
Disease tolerance
Healing rate
Body size/structural strength/hit points

Is Constitution and Stamina enough, or does it have to be split even further
to meet your needs.  If you go over about 12 attributes, people will not
go for the system all that much (too complex).
