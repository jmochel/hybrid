I guess that IS why I like the way I had set it out.  For me skills
involve abstract knowledge.  By identifying a characters knowledge in various
areas you identify what types of skills a character might be good at or
easily pick up.  It becomes an abstract skills system.
Skills is another area we need to address.  I like working from the abstract
to the specific, because it encourages modularity.  If you have a skills
system that begins in abstract concepts, that allows you to build skills
however you want later on.  If on the other hand we simply began laying
out a list of skills, then we don't have a more generic concept to refer
back to, to create new skills or determine outcomes etc.  The resulting
methods of dealing with skills will be simplified in the long run
(I believe) by starting with abstracts which rules can hang around.

I like this idea.  I guess the way I had mapped it out before, all of the
above attributes were grouped under MIND/INTELLIGENCE & MIND/WISDOM.  In
keeping with the scalability of attributes that I am particularly excited
about right now, I could see that the attributes you talk about above could
be expanded from the attributes I put forth when/if the game wanted too.

Thanks for the input!
