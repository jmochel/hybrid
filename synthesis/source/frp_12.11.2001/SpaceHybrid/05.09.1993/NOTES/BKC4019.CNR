Wow, it really worked!  (the reply command  Wow!)
        Well, in testing out a new mechanic of a game, I always thought of
two ways to do it:
        1.  announce the changes at the beginning of the adventure.
           And write down the changes!!!

        2.  Don't let established characters change their mode of operation
                radically just to fit your new op guide.   If you must,
                        a. do it slowly, and
                        b. if they really don't go for it, don't let this
                                be the death of their character...
                                (of course, if this [popularly called the
                                dream sequence senario] is used, they do not
                                get expierience, karma or whatever for it! :)


Personally, in the few changes I play with, I try to announce them beforehand,
and follwo #2....



Well, nm
er, um,   Well, here is my #1 & my #2  !
