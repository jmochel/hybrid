here's my suggestions.  Do what you will with or to them... but if they get
published I want my name down as a contributor.   :-)

Fitness   This includes two stats:  Strength and Endurance . Note they should
          not differ by too much... Say, d100 for total fitness, plus 2d10 to
          divide between the two.
   Strength is just that.  How much you can lift, how hard you hit, etc.
   Endurance is also self explanatory.  How long can you run before you
          collapse?  How many days can you play an RPG before you have to
          crash?  Etc.

          Realistically, these would be fairly close to each other.  You just
 don't see 98-pound weaklings running marathons.  People who are fit have a
 good balance between strength and endurance.

Intellect  This includes Reasoning and Knowledge.  Again, you don't have moron
          Trivial Pursuit players, so they would be fairly close to each other.
          Say d100 plus 2d10 to split between the two.
    Reasoning is potential ability.  What you are capable of doing if you tried
          hard enough.
    Knowledge is what you know.  Ie Trivial Pursuit champions.

Agility.   You know what this is.  Anybody can be clumsy tho, so it gets its
          own category.  d100.

Charisma  Appearance and charm.  I'm not sure how these would be separated.
          perhaps d100 each.  Charm is personality.
