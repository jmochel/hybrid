Someone made a point about leadership, and it was well put.  Most games have
been designed by an individual, or a very small group, with a larger circle
of playtesters who provide *advice*, which may or may not be implemented.

I think it will be difficult to get a net.consensus on virtually *any* aspect
of this RPG, because there will always be a minority who object to one thing
or another.  I agree that there have been a number of good ideas presented,
but just because they are good does not mean they are compatible.  If there
is not some sort of way to "fix" a certain rule and force people to accept it
as a net.rule, whether they like it or not, this discussion will never get
anywhere.

For instance, someone said dice are not important, and that once you have the
system, any dice you feel like can be implemented.

Hohohoho.....

The choice of dice influences every aspect of the game.  Will you have dice
rolls against attributes?  Then the attribute range must match the dice type.
Do you want an inherent bell curve, or a linear dice curve where the skill
modifiers provide the proper dropoff?  This influences whether you use a d10,
d6, d20 or d100, or 2d6, 3d6, etc.  Do you want a lot of average rolls, with
few oddballs?  Then use lots of dice and count on averaging.  Do you want a
wider range of variability?  Then use less dice.  If you want high numbers
on dice, do low numbers mean equipment failure (gun jams)?  Then how does the
number of dice rolled affect this?

Simple considerations like this influence *everything* else, and the same
arguments can be made on the attributes used, skill system implementation,
combat, character generation, experience, and so on.

As a designer, I can tell you some priorities, which you have already found
out:

What are your attributes?
What is the scale they are based on (a human norm range, for instance)?
What type of dice will you use?

Until you find a way to decide these and make them *nearly* immutable to
change, you will continue to play with theory and never get around to
practice.

I believe I said a lot of this last time around, along with "I told you so".

Don't make me say it again ;);)

Please.

P.S.    Even shared world novels have their background parameters fixed before
the various authors start writing.  It's the only way to make a group creative
effort work well.
