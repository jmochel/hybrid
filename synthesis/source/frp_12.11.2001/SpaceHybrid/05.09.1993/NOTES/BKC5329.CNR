Ewwww.  I've used the relay before.  It's disgusting.  Besides, with all the
time-zone differences and relay hours, it might be difficult coming up with an
acceptable meeting time.

Yes!  Very good idea.  But is it playable?  As you suggested, have PCs pay an
upkeep value to keep their current levels.  If they can't make the upkeep,
their skills go down (by how much?).

But I'd like a game WITHOUT an XP system.  Advancement based on successful use
of skills.

Oh, but never quit trying to attain realism!  It's too easy to be fatalistic
and say it's impossible reach a certain level of realism without sacrificing
too much playability... I say keep trying.  The gaming gurus have been coming
up with better and better methods over the years.  I think we'll keep finding
better ways to include maximum amounts of realism (when desired...) *and*
playability.  That's Efficiency.
