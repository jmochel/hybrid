Hiya, Ursus.

Let me explain my opinion on this matter.

I want to create a RPG in the Fantasy genre.

First, any well-designed game should be very adaptable to any genre, simply by
dropping in a new skills module, and a new combat module if necessary (for
pistols and so on).  Once we create a modular, skill-based FRPG, we already
have the basis for a generic game.

Second, by choosing a genre, we can place some reasonable limits on the stuff
we have to create.  If we try to create a generic RPG, then it's hard to decide
what skills to create, what kind of equipment to list, and so on.  If we
created a generic RPG, we'd have to create at least one module for a specific
genre just to make the game fun to play.

Third, I chose the Fantasy genre because I think we're all really familiar with
Fantasy's various aspects and problems.  Also, Fantasy includes a lot of
different problems -- assigning (or not) stats to deities and monsters,
detailed HTH weapons combat, ranged combat, martial arts combat, armor, magic
of all types, nonhuman races, and so on.  No other single genre covers as many
areas as Fantasy.

Can we all agree to work on a modular and expandable Fantasy RPG?
