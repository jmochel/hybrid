I would hesitate to include the categories (i.e. STRENGTH, etc.) in a final
version of the game, except as trivia in the GM's Guide.  I've listed them here
for the benefit of the people who liked the system.

Likewise, the P/M/S categories were noted for those who preferred such a
system.  (Please, no PMS jokes...)  Grace should have been listed as a (P)
Physical attribute (whoops).

Hey, I figured I'd get attacked by everyone for that correlation.  I'm glad one
fellow empath understands!  =)

"Power" is a bit vague.  We can go back to the old standby "Strength" if we
have to.  Power could be mental power, physical power, or magical power.  Or it
could be _a_ power.  Anyone have a good, specific, precise, interesting
replacement for "Muscle"?

As in graphic design, utility sometimes supercedes beauty.  It does the job
well.  If we can come up with a prettier word, great!  Otherwise, let's leave
it alone, since it works.


>> Endurance (P)    |  ability to take damage and pain
>
>    This is also the degree to which you can physically exert yourself.

Noted and corrected.


>> Quickness (P)    |  quickness of muscle (not reaction time!)
>
>    Um... Where did this come from, and what happened to reflex?

That came from the Crypts of Adam's Mind.  Maybe it should've stayed there, eh?
When constructing the Dualistic model, I needed a physical speed attribute, and
quickness worked.  Quickness is more specific than Reflex, and can be used for
running speed and so on.

Reaction time (reflex?) is a function of both Perception and Quickness.  I hate
formulas, but this one looks unavoidable.


>    I think that Agility is probably a better name. If you like please leve
>the category name as Grace, but I see physical grace as Agility.

Can do!


>> Sanity (M)       |  mental stability and capacity
>

Make that "stability and capacity for new (mind-blowing) concepts"...
So, NO, Sanity is not Memory.  Memory could be the STRENGTH counterpart in the
MENTAL column just as easily as Command is.

Or Memory could replace Sanity.  I like that better...  Do it?


>> Willpower (S)    |  strength of character and mental fortitude
>
>    You see Willpower as a Social attribute? Then how can it account for
>mental fortitude? I think you have a typo here in your clasification of
>Willpower.

Not a typo, but a mistake nonetheless.  It should be a (M) Mental attribute.

As I stated earlier, I simply listed them for the convenience of the people who
wished to categorize attributes in P/M/S columns.
