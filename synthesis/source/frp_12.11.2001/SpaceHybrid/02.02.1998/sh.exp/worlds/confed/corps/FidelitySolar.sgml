Since 1946, a philosophy of continuous improvement
 Travel the Fidelity timeline 

Fidelity was founded fifty years ago by Edward C. Johnson 2d on a
simple premise: work harder and smarter every day to help a small
group of investors meet their goals. Today, that philosophy remains
intact, except for the fact that our "small group of investors" has grown
to include corporations, not-for-profit organizations, financial institutions
and advisors, as well as millions of individuals worldwide. 

Mr. Johnson created an environment where individuals were encouraged to question each other's
viewpoints, to challenge conventional wisdom, to share knowledge gleaned from a wide variety of
sources, to take intelligent risks. In short, he created an environment where the best ideas won. The
result? A unique money management style and an intense focus on customer service. Over the years,
our philosophy and culture has evolved Fidelity from a mutual fund company to a diversified financial
services company, with such diverse offerings as benefits management, trust and global brokerage
services. 

Throughout our history, our focus on technology has enhanced our ability to offer both our institutional
clients and individual investors superior service. This year alone, Fidelity will invest some $500 million
dollars in hardware, software, and systems that enable us not only to analyze and research virtually
every publicly traded company in the world, but to provide our customers with the most up-to-the-minute
information they need to help them make sound financial decisions. 

Whether it's providing services to corporations, banks and financial planners, or helping you to manage
your personal portfolio online, we strive to set the standard of excellence for our industry. If that means
inventing something new, changing the way things ordinarily would work, or redesigning our systems,
that's what we'll do. You can count on the fact that Fidelity will always aim to research more companies
more thoroughly than anyone else, to offer you more convenient ways to do business and to constantly
provide you with new financial services and products that fit your needs, now and in the future.

Timeline



The seeds of Fidelity's corporate history were sown as far back as
1943 when Edward Crosby Johnson 2d was first associated with
Fidelity Fund. The period from 1946 through 1972 is an era referred
to as the "Mister Johnson Years" because of the impact Mr.
Johnson had in shaping the company's values and style. Not only
did Mr. Johnson encourage his employees to take intelligent risks
instead of following the crowd, he pioneered the unique approach to
investment management that Fidelity Management & Research
Company still follows today. 






The years 1972 through 1979 could be called a time of
"Innovation, Survival and Diversification." Edward C.
"Ned" Johnson 3d became president and introduced a
series of industry firsts, such as offering checkwriting on
money market funds and using a computerized
telephone system to provide quotes 24 hours a day.
Ned's foresight led him to invest in top talent and infrastructure to position Fidelity
for the next bull market, building an investment management team and establishing
a discount brokerage service. 






The 80s "Bull Market" period of 1980 to 1989 was a
time of ideal business conditions and new legislation
favoring investing for retirement. This environment,
coupled with Fidelity's investment in technology during
the decade, made our rapid expansion possible and
profitable. In the aftermath of the stock market crash of
1987, Fidelity used the slow-down in business to
improve productivity and to build for the future -- just as
it had in the 70s. 





"Staying Nimble" has been Fidelity's watchword for
the period of 1990 to the present. It's been a period
of great change, during which Fidelity has thrived by
listening and quickly responding to customers. There
will inevitably be more changes ahead, and though
we are unable to predict what they might be, we'll
ensure that tomorrow will bring innovations that
continue Fidelity's tradition of excellence.

ummary of Code of Ethics 

                                 Fidelity's Code of Ethics is based on the guiding principle that has always motivated our entire
                                 business: the interests of our shareholders are our top priority. Fidelity's officers, directors, and
                                 employees have a fiduciary duty to our fund shareholders. For this relationship to work, shareholders
                                 must have complete trust and confidence in us. When the potential for conflict arises, it is our obligation
                                 to put shareholders' interests over the interests of either employees or the company. 

                                      Background 
                                      Objectives 
                                      General Provisions 
                                      Added Provisions for "Access" People 
                                      Added Provisions for Investment Professionals and Senior Executives 
                                      Monitoring and Enforcement 

                                 Background 

                                 Fidelity formalized its philosophy of holding shareholder interests foremost with a written Code of Ethics
                                 in the late 1960s. In 1980, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) made written ethical
                                 standards a requirement for all fund companies. Each fund company was free to write its own code, but
                                 the SEC reserved the right to review each one on a routine basis to ensure it continued to protect
                                 shareholders' interests. This practice continues today. 

                                 Fidelity views our Code as a living document that exists to ensure that the interests of our shareholders
                                 are continually protected. We review the Code regularly and -- with the approval of our counsel and
                                 independent fund trustees -- update it to keep current with changes in the industry. For example, in
                                 1994 we incorporated all of the personal investing recommendations made by the Investment Company
                                 Institute's Blue Ribbon Panel. Some of our Code provisions -- such as those dealing with short selling
                                 and use of research notes -- go beyond the panel's recommendations. 

                                 Objectives 

                                 The purpose of our Code of Ethics is to ensure that when employees buy or sell securities for their
                                 personal account, they do not create actual or potential conflicts with Fidelity's mutual funds. We
                                 believe that portfolio managers buying and selling for their own account is an important element of
                                 personal freedom, and can help us to recruit and retain the very best people, many of whom want to
                                 participate directly in the markets. We do not, however, allow them or any employees to use information
                                 about Fidelity's investment recommendations or fund transactions for their personal profit or to refrain
                                 from acting for the funds -- and their shareholders -- for their personal benefit. 

                                 General Provisions 

                                 New employees are briefed on the Code and are given a copy when hired. Within one week of joining the
                                 company, they must indicate in writing that they have read the Code and agree to its provisions. After
                                 that, we require employees at the beginning of each year to review the Code and acknowledge in writing
                                 by January 31 that their personal investing has complied with its requirements. 

                                 The following provisions of Fidelity's Code of Ethics apply to all employees. 

                                 A. Personal transactions: The Code requires all employees to report their personal securities
                                 transactions to Fidelity. This includes activity in any account where an employee has a monetary
                                 interest. 

                                 B. Reportable securities: The Code applies to the buying and selling of virtually all securities, including
                                 options and futures on groups of securities or securities indexes. The SEC has exempted from reporting
                                 certain securities, including open-end mutual funds, certificates of deposit, and short-term government
                                 obligations. 

                                 C. Brokerage accounts: All employees must conduct their personal investing through a Fidelity
                                 Brokerage account. This practice helps us to achieve compliance with the Code and allows us to more
                                 easily monitor personal account activity on an ongoing basis. 

                                 D. Reporting requirements: All employees must report their personal transactions to Fidelity. How often
                                 depends on whether they are "access" or "non-access" people. 

                                 "Access" people are employees with access to Fidelity's investment research, recommendations, or
                                 fund transactions. This includes fund managers, research analysts, traders, and senior executives, as
                                 well as people in our legal, compliance, and treasurer's departments. "Access" employees must report
                                 all personal transactions monthly. 

                                 "Non-access" people must report all personal transactions annually. 

                                 E. General restrictions: The following restrictions also apply to all of Fidelity's employees. They may
                                 not: 

                                      knowingly buy or sell a security just before transactions in the same or equivalent securities
                                      (e.g., convertible preferred stocks or bonds) by a Fidelity fund; 
                                      cause or prevent fund activity for personal benefit; 
                                      use knowledge about fund transactions for personal benefit; 
                                      sell short any security, unless the employee already owns the security in his or her personal
                                      account. (Selling short involves borrowing securities from a brokerage for return at a future date.
                                      The investor sells the stock in the expectation that the security's price will decline by the time he
                                      or she has to buy it back.); 
                                      engage in "excessive" trading in a personal account; 
                                      participate in initial public offerings, hedge funds, investment clubs, or similar groups; 
                                      use options or futures to take positions in securities which would not be allowed under the Code; 
                                      accept gifts of a value greater than $100. 

                                 Added Provisions for "Access" People 

                                 In addition to these general provisions, there are certain requirements that apply only to "access"
                                 employees -- those with access to information about Fidelity's investment research recommendations
                                 and fund transactions. 

                                 F. Pre-clearance of trades: Under the Code, "access" employees must get permission from Fidelity
                                 before making a personal transaction. We restrict pre-clearance when fund trades are pending. 

                                 G. Restricted securities: "Access" people cannot buy either securities issued by a broker-dealer or
                                 Fidelity closed-end funds for their personal accounts. 

                                 Added Provisions for Investment Professionals and Senior Executives 

                                 Investment professionals and senior executives are subject to the general provisions and provisions for
                                 "access" people, as well as to some additional requirements. (One provision applies just to fund
                                 managers.) 

                                 H. Short-term trading: Investment professionals and senior executives cannot keep profits made from
                                 transactions in the same or equivalent securities if the transactions are made within 60 calendar days of
                                 each other. If this happens, we give the profits away to a charitable organization. 

                                 I. Research notes: When a Fidelity analyst issues a research note on a company, investment
                                 professionals and senior executives must wait two business days before they can trade in the securities
                                 of that company for their personal account. 

                                 J. Additional restrictions for investment professionals and senior executives: Furthermore, investment
                                 professionals and senior executives: 

                                      must get approval from Fidelity to serve on a board of directors 
                                      must get approval from Fidelity to participate in private placement transactions 
                                      must disclose all securities holdings within seven days of joining the company and annually
                                      thereafter 

                                 Additionally, investment professionals have an affirmative duty to recommend suitable securities for the
                                 benefit of the funds. 

                                 K. Additional restriction for portfolio managers: Portfolio managers may not personally buy or sell a
                                 security either seven calendar days before or after their fund buys or sells the same security. 

                                 Monitoring and Enforcement 

                                 We take seriously our responsibility to oversee and enforce Fidelity's Code of Ethics. The company's
                                 investment compliance staff is a large group of highly trained professionals. Their mandate is to
                                 supervise Fidelity's compliance and internal control activities. An audit committee, comprised of
                                 independent trustees of the Fidelity funds, oversees the compliance function. Coopers & Lybrand
                                 reviews our compliance activities and reports its findings to the trustees. Additionally, Fidelity
                                 undertakes significant efforts to educate employees through orientation training and annual review
                                 sessions. 

                                 Within the compliance department, our ethics officer has primary responsibility for ensuring that
                                 employees are following all of the provisions of the Code of Ethics. The officer also sees that the
                                 appropriate procedures and systems are in place to monitor compliance. These include both
                                 preventative controls that seek to eliminate inadvertent violations of the Code and detective controls that
                                 analyze trading patterns. In addition, the ethics officer, along with others in senior management or on
                                 the funds' Board, recommend modifications to the Code to ensure that it continues to provide adequate
                                 safeguards and keeps pace with changes in the industry. 

                                 When there is reason to believe an employee has violated the Code, the compliance department
                                 conducts an in-depth review. As part of this process, the employee has an opportunity to present his or
                                 her side of the story. The ethics officer then decides or recommends the appropriate action to take. An
                                 ethics oversight committee made up of senior management meets to review the ethics officer's
                                 recommendations. 

                                 Sanctions under the Code range in severity from a caution administered by the ethics officer to
                                 warnings, fines, dismissal, referral to the SEC or other civil regulatory authorities, and ultimately referral
                                 for criminal prosecution.
