Hi folks:

Here is a quick summary of Psionics limitations and ranges that 
might be interesting. 

First, here is the current solid notes on Psionics:

--------------------------------------------------------------------

\chapter{Psionics}

\section{Intro}

This chapter outlines one of the more interesting areas of SF gaming: 
Pyschic Phenomenom or Psionics. What is to be noted is that no 
comfortable way could be found to make a truly generic set of psionic 
abilities. A great deal of the limitations described here are indeed 
implementation specific and could be changed on GM's whim.

Psionics is the application of mental force to directly affect an entitie's
surroundings. The use of psionics is dependent upon the total concentration
of the psionic. 

\section{Areas of Psionics}

Energetics, Telekinetics, Temporokinetics, Biokinetics, Mystokinetics

\section{Gaining Psionics}

All entities have the potential for psionics. 
All Psionic Skills are mental disciplines.

\section{Usage of Psionics}

There are several things of note to be mentioned. The first and foremost
is that it is always easier to affect inanimate objects with Psionics.

When attempting to affect other entities the percentage chance to succeed
is lowered by the defending entities MDF. An actively defending individual
lowers it by 2 * MDF.

\subsection{Skill Rolls}

Attempting to use Psionics requires a skill roll just as any other skill.
The same DF modifiers apply as to any other action. 

\subsection{Concentration Checks}

If the Psionic is disturbed in any way the entity must make an DF -2 roll
against that psionic skill in order to continue their concentration. This
concentration may be made up to three times per pulse. If more than that is
needed , give it up. Psionics may use special aids in concentrating including: 
Meditation, Ear Plugs, Drugs etc...

\subsection{Mental movement}

Mental movement governs that distance in M/sec that can be covered by 
a psionics powers while concentrating. This is subject to the specific
rules of a given psionic skill.

\subsection{Range of Psionics}

Varies

\subsection{Damage of Psionics}

Varies

\subsection{Base effect}

?

\subsection{Feedback}

One of the great limitations on Psionics is the fact that most 
life forms (especially sentient ones) generate a field of resistance to
psionic manipulation. This is not a factor in certain operations: 
Simple empathy rolls or Surface reads pose no problem. Telepathy into
an unwilling mind is potentially hazardous. Most telekinetic and
Biokinetic skills are also affected. 

\section{Areas of Psionics}

\begin{description}
	\item[Telekinetics]
	Telekinetics is the use of the mind to impart kinetic energy to an
	object. The use of psionics to toss objects around is a telekinetic 
	action.
	\item[Temporokinetics]
	Temporokinetics is the use of the mind to affect the spatial integrity
	of the surrounding area. Teleportation is a temporokinetic action.
	\item[Biokinetics]
	The use of a mind to directly influence a biological system. Placing 
	oneself in suspended animation is a typical biokinetic feat.
	\item[Energetics]
	The use of the mind to directly affect the molecular nature of a
	material. Setting fire to paper or dissolving a glue would be 
	typical actions of an energetic.
    \item[Telepathics]
    The use of the mind to influence other minds at the emotional and concious
    communication level. This does not go down far enough to effect most bodily
    processess.
	\item[Mystokinetics]
    Basically this covers the more mysterious skills that are less subject
    to mechanistic explanations than the above four categories. 
	Precognition is an example of such.
\end{description}

\section{Skills Involved}

There is a Filter Skill for each of the areas of psionics. 
In addition there is a Perception skill associated with each area.

And finally there a specific skills within each area of psionics.

A Telekinetic would have the following range of skills:

Telekinetics(Filter)
Telekinetic Perception
Telekinesis (Move Object ?)

A Biokinetic would have the following range of skills:

Biokinetics(Filter)
Biokinetic Perception
Biokinesis (Influence Body ?)

A Temporokinetic would have the following range of skills:

Temporokinetics(Filter)
temporokinetic Perception
Temporokinesis (Transition Object ?)

A Energetic would have the following range of skills:

Energetics(Filter)
Energetic Perception
Ergokinesis (Transform Energy ?)

A Telepath would have the following range of skills:

Telepathics(Filter)
Telepathic Perception
Empathy
Surface Read
Telepathy 
Mind Mel(t/d)

A Mystic would have he following Skills

Mystokinetics(Filter)
Mystokinetic Perception
Precognition
Clairsentience
Object Reading (Retrocognition ?)

There are also skills such as Stealth(Psionic), and Deception(Psionic)

------------------------------------------------------------------------


Now,
  Here are the verbal notes I have about Pisonic ranges and 
strengths and effects. The labels are not significant except
that they give information on relative positions.

Empathy - Low Cost, Easy, Long range
Surface Read - Low Cost, Easy, Long Range
Telepathy - Low Cost, Easy, Long Range

Biokinesis - Med Cost, Medium Diff, Short Range

Ergokinesis - High Cost, Medium Diff, Short Range

Precognition - Low Cost, High Difficulty, 
Clairsentience - Low Cost, High Difficulty, 
Object Read - Low Cost, High Difficulty, 

Telekinesis - Med Cost, Medium Difficulty, SHort Range

To give some ideas of what the powers should be like here are
some examples of what I would like psionics to be able to do.

Telepaths at a low level should be able to pick someones mind
pattern out of a crowd in a room, 'path to someone in
the room if they don't know them, 'path to someone anywhere 
in the ship if they know them well, and maintain that conversation
for as long a an hour. Telepaths at a high level (10-12) of skill should be 
able to locate a mind somewhere in a ship, 'path to someone in a 
ship if they don't know them, 'path to someone anywhere in a town 
if they know them well, and maintain that conversation for 
a few hours. Telepaths at the very top (20) of skill should be able 
to locate a mind somewhere in a city (takes time), 'path to someone
in a town if they don't know them, path to someone in orbit if they know
know them well.

Temporokinetics at a low level should be able to sense when a teleport 
has occured in the area, 'port small objects
in line of sight or to recently memorised locations. At a medium level (6-7) 
they should be able to teleport themselves to line of sight locations. At 
high levels (10-12) they should be able to teleport themselves to memorised 
places beyond line of sight. At rank 20 it should be possible to teleport to 
and from orbit given a location taken from another's mind.

Biokinetics at a low level should be able to ease pain, sense what is wrong 
with themselves or others. At a medium level they should be able to cure shock,
bring down fever, and anaesthesize people. At a high level you should be able 
to speed reflexes, increase strength, Suspend animation. 

Telekinetics at a low level should be able to move chairs across a room, 
float cups of coffee. Medium level telekinetics should be able to levitate 
themselves and oves things around in rooms they can't see. High level 
'kinetics should be able to do simple flight with themselves, block 
punches with their minds. Master level 'kinetics should be able to 
parry bullets, do fairly quick flight.

Energetics at a low level should be able to heat/cool cups of water,
keep themselves warm. At a medium level they should be able to ignite
paper or wood, cause electrical switches to bridge, blow light bulbs.
High level energetisists should be able to generate light, redirect
spark gaps, protect themselves from UV. Master levels should be able to 
generate laser beams, protect themselves from radiation.

Mystics at a low level should be able to get a general sense of danger.
Medium evel should be able to determine that this person is in 
danger (if they have met them). High level mystics should be able to 
predict simple events. Master level mystics should be able to tell 
you what horse to bet on.

In all of these it must be remembered that these are the limits of what 
someone can do. It may require meditation and setup as well as power. The 
Energetic and Temporokinetic areas are limited by the power the use.
Mystics are limited by the difficulty of what they attempt.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

For those in the In-The-Know group of Karban they can consider this to be 
a official esper corp summary of what can be done with psionics with 
the following alterations: The Esper corp does not acknowledge the existence
of the Mystic skills and they have no certain knowledge of any skill 
levels above medium. High level feats are a matter of unsubstantiated rumor and
master level events are fantasy.

Yvette would be aware of what the Esper corp (Lesk) thinks is real and can 
tailor her report accordingly.

Any comments ? Flames ?
