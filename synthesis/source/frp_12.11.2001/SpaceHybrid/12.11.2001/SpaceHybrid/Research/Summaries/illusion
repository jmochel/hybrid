Chris:
	I was just about to post this question when I saw your post:
Have any of you SCA fighters used (or seen used) successfully any parrying
weapons?  I would love to know how well they work in "actual" combat, and
how good a model of medieval combat you people believe SCA combat is.  I
went to one fight about 10 years ago, got my legs "cut off" in about 10
seconds, and was completely bewildered. :-)   Anyone care to run down the
pros and cons of shields vs. parrying weapons vs. single weapons?  (Send
your responses directly to me if you think they are too dull for the
list :-)

Tabby:
	*If* you run in a system where illusions can kill people, then
IMHO, the only logical explanation (of magic can be explained logically)
is that the illusion fools the mind enough to have physical effects.
If you accept that idea, you can run that in a couple of different ways:
	A)  The victim believes s/he is being impaled/burned or whatever
nasty thing is happening to them, but shows no damage to neutral observers.
The victim, however, believes so strongly that they create the pain, and
if the illusion is strong enough, they literally "scare themselves to death."
	B)  As above except that the mind/soul has enough power over the
body to actually create the changes it believes to have occured (but only
to the best of its ability).  It might be able to produce wounds, and
could certainly mimic the effects of a disease.  Victim might have a fever,
waste away, etc, but wouldn't *really* have the disease (it couldn't be
caught by another character, for example).
	In either case, I don't think the *illusion* should have the
power to create.  If someone takes damage from an illusionary disease
(how do you convince someone they have an illusionary disease, btw?),
it should not be because the illusion created the disease.  If someone
suffocates because of an illusionary bag over their head (which I would
rule as possible) it should not be because the bag is at all real.  Other-
wise illusion becomes even more powerful as a form of creation magic.

	This is why I hate illusions.  I realize that your question assumes
that illusions can kill, but if you have any power over this, you might
want to reconsider it.  It makes illusions very powerful and opens several
cans of worms.  Can I be healed by drinking an illusionary healing potion?
Can I turn into a deity by drinking an illusionary potion of "polymorph
into deity?"... you get the idea.

Subject:      sexism and illusions
To: Multiple recipients of list GMAST-L <GMAST-L@UTCVM>
Status: RO

First, I think there are a few very well-known archetypes (that is the
definition of archetype isn't it?) which give rise to the 'sexism' charge.
For instance the covers to "<insert noun phrase here> of Gor."  Which OUGHT
to be sexist because the books are pretty blatantly sexist too.  I think
the Conan books were like that too.  Obviously this sells books on the premise
that the content of the book is somehow related to the cover; same prinicple
they use to sell trashy romances and sleazy westerns.  I don't think that the
same prinicple applies to games--they're much more expensive and much less
likely to contain steamy narratives--but I'm sure it probably has some small
effect.  And yes, there is a lot of fantasy art which isn't sexist.

As Ananda pointed out it is very hard to debate the effects of illusions
because illusion mechanics are so different from game to game.  In my own
game I observe the following basic rules:

 1)Illusions are VISUAL.  (The more complex spells can also be audio, thermal,
   etc.)  If you cannot sense the illusion it has no effect on you.  A visual
   illusion cast behind someone will not affect them unless you can get them
   to turn around.

 2)The ONLY effects of an illusion result from the mind of the victim.  I do
   permit illusions to cause damage, although normal illusions (not P-killer)
   cannot cause death; only unconsciousness and possible psych complications.
   This works great in ADND where "hit points" are an amalgamation of factors
   including stamina, stress, "coolness", etc. and do not just represent
   physical damage.  A phantasmal crossbow bolt would have an effect on the
   morale of the person who was shot, IF he could be convinced that he was hit.
   A phantasmal fireball might have some effect on a person if he had
   experienced fireballs before and was terrified of them.  Of course such an
   illusion would probably fall flat without thermal and auditory components.

   From rule two, it follows that phantasmal armor would affect the way in
   which the blow was struck but not physically affect the blow.  For instance,
   a dagger-wielding orc facing an opponent in illusionary plate might think,
   "hmm, my dagger won't pierce that; I'll attack someone else."  On the other
   hand the same orc with a bastard sword might reason "he's got plate armor,
   I better swing harder."  So it could have the opposite of the desired
   effect.

Regarding damage, it is true that all sensation takes place in the brain and
the nerves are only I/O devices.  Probably most of you have had the experience
of "burning" yourself with cold water that you expected to be hot.  Thus a
character under attack from illusionary crossbow bolts might feel a hit if he
truly expected it to come.  On the other hand, as in the "hot" water example,
he might immediately afterwards realize that he hadn't been hit, as there is
no blood, no bolt shaft sticking out of his armor, etc.  Thus the only effect
of that illusion would be to distract him for a round or maybe a few, while
he tried to sort out what happened.  (On the other hand, a GM might rule that
in the "fog of combat" the victim was not sufficiently clear-minded to realize
all this and lost some hit points in terms of disorientation.)

As a player, it depends on what the GM's philosophy is, but I usually try to
avoid person-affecting illusions for that reason.  I prefer distance illusions
that obscure, confuse, distract, or misdirect.  Another question you might
ask yourselves is "when an illusion is disbelieved (strictly ADND here) does
it vanish, or does the victim simply realize that it is an illusion?"  For
instance, take an illusion of a stone wall obscuring a corridor.  Anyone
successfully disbelieving THAT illusion will be no better off than when they
started (at least in my game).  They will realize that they can walk through
the wall, but they still cannot see through it.  If there are archers on the
other side, they can't see them either (although the archers are at a similar
disadvantage).  If there is a deep pit on the other side, they won't know until
they step through.

About the nastiest thing I ever saw done, and unfortunately it was done to ME,
was a GM who used an illusionary wraith.  My character was familiar with
non-corporeal, level-draining undead, and though he had never seen a wraith
before, he had a pretty good idea of what it was and what its powers were.
I lost many levels to this creature before its creator took a hit which spoiled
the spell.  Even then the shock was great enough that it took a few hours for
me to be functioning fully.  Of course the illusion would have no effect on
any character who had never experienced or heard of level draining undead,
except of course for fear.  Ignorance can be bliss, sometimes.

So what would be the effect of an illusionary chainmail bikini?

        I've only skimmed the post on this, but there are a lot of good points
in it. I think that if you begin with the premise that illusions can kill,
becuase of the power of the mind, as if they are sort of halfway between
magic and psionics, then, yes, if you die by falling into an illusionary
pit, you are dead.
        However, some of the examples Tabby used raise an important issue -
yopu must have a frame of referecne in which to illusion can kill you. In a
fantasy world, a plastic bag over the head illusion won't work, becuase no one
knows what plastic is, or that you can't breath through it.  a heart attack
might not work either, or a disease, due to lack of medical knowledge

  I agree with you there but what if you used and easly noticed desiese(sp)
such as Lepercy(sp) which everyone recognized as sore spots on the skin. And if
you say Illusios can kill then can Illusionary aurmor protect and if it does
can a mage wear it??

How should illusions able can kill be handled? I say like any other death
magic, with the special effect that they work by illusions.

Allowing your average illusion spell to be able to induce death makes it
damn powerful, probably toppling game balance.

The main point behind illusions seems to be that you believe in them, and make
them actually happen. However, someone affected by a disease would rarely give
in to it, there is hope as long as there is breath. The body's inner workings
won't be too much affected by conscient thought anyway. You might rule that
this struggle of the body against the imaginated disease is the actual cause
of death, antigenes, shock, etc, but it assumes that our medicinical knowledge
and magic can exist together, and further, that one can induce the effects of
illusionary germs by playing with perception. IMO, this is too farfetched to
be used in games. Death magic is much easier.

Well, IMHO, psychologically, anything is possible. I believe that every
illusion should have some chance of killing the patient, or why do we have
people who die in their sleep while having bad dreams. Otherwise, I would
think that the subconscious mind would/could cause the body to go into shock
or make the person pass out, etc because of what the conscious mind is/was
experiencing.

This does not prove a point. Illusion armor is stupid, because it does not
protect the user (really) from physical stuff. An illusory weapon's effective-
ness is dependant upon who is actually seeing the weapon, because then this
usually indicates who is effected most by it.

By the way:

What happens if someone makes an illusionary opening in a wall, affecting all
senses? Is one able to walk through it?
Reminds me of an old trap: a waterfall falling in front an opening in the wall.
There is an illusion of an opening (in fact, the opening) and another
of a water fall cast over it. Our intrepid explorers will soon doubt the
reality of the illusionary waterfall, make their saving throw, and walk
through it. But there IS a waterfall.

Illusions affect the perception, but have no physical reality other than
the physics of perception. On the other hand, I can't see any difference
between real and illusionary pain. What now?

Do people really die in sleep from what they dream? How come we know that?
People are said to have died from a sudden experience of fear, but not everyone
ought to be prone to it.

All of this depends on a set of premises that many won't agree to either for
being too few or too many. Illusions should, IMO, do nothing else than change
the input for CONSCIENT thought, not being able to trigger even a knee-jerk or
other reflex. IMO, everything else is too real to be called an illusion.

     Dave,

 You say an Illusonary Orc can kill someone. So if a real Orc come up to a mage
and doens't disbelieve he will see the aurmor. And to him it will be real. So
to him it will protect. Now what if you put the aurmor on the Orc he thinks it
is still real so to hime it will protect him as well. Now wouldn't it? It might
not actually but to him it would am I right??

I think that we are throwing and missing at the target here about illusions.
If you will recall, someone stated that illusions 'changed the perceptions of
the victim'. This is the main function of the illusion power.

Since I would classify sight as a main sense, and that all others are second-
ary, I would say that sight sense takes up a majority of a person's perception
of the world around him. Even if an illusion was sight only, it would still
cause the person to perceive that something was there. Illusions also have a
'dulling' effect on the other senses. To prove my point, I am going to say
this:

In the past I have had a lot of friends who took heavy drugs like acid. From
what I have heard, IMHO, acid severely alters a person's sight perceptions,
allowing him or her to see illusions unleashed by his subconscious mind. And
even though the person knew that the illusions were false, and that he could
reach out and touch them, smell them, etc, he still could not change his
perception of what was happening. If this illusion was a hostile one (my
friend once got attacked by a phone), it puts undue stress on the system
(natural reaction). If this continues, or the perceptions seem deadly, I
would rule that the victim of the illusions *might* (5%-10% chance?) die
from system shock. I am not saying that they should kill all the time, I
am saying that there is a *chance* of killing.

I also think that the effectiveness of an illusion also depends on the
special effect, i.e. the description of the illusion. I think that illusive
armor is stupid, just causes the opponent to swing harder (I know...I have
seen, and been in several SCA fights...nothing special...I just authorized
in sword and shield) to do more damage. However, an illusive weapon *might*
be effective in combat, but unless it had some form of special function, it
should not kill. Only when an illusion is overwhelmingly frightful should it
be considered a killing blow...and then it should have a *chance*. Such ex-
amples would be: falling into a lake/pit/whatever of lava, falling from a
distance that you know you will die from (in AD&D, a high level character can
fall a great distance, which I think is stupid), the grim reaper cutting you
in half with his scythe, etc...you know what I mean. Stuff you *know* you can
instantly die from.

In conclusion, I would like to add that if illusions are powerful enough to
affect the mind as well as they do, then there should be some sort of real
use in it besides that creating goofy pictures of your surroundings. You are
dealing with the human (or other) nervous system here!

     First I'ld like to say that in general I like illusions.  They require

more interaction and imagination than most spells.  Yes they can be
incredably powerful, BUT ONLY IF THEY ARE BELIEVED!  That's the big draw
back.  They're not as effective against smart opponents.

     Now a few specific responses:

** Re: Tabby <MUALLEMA%ECUVM1.BITNET@pucc.PRINCETON.EDU>

     I'ld say no to illusionary diseases and heart attacks because of the
lack of understanding of the workings of the human body.  Illusions only work
if both the caster and the victim understand the effects of the illusion.
That's why there are incredible bonuses for the victim if the caster is
trying to make an illusion of something he's never seen.

     But even assuming that it did work, what caster is going to maintain a
spell that requires concentration and line-of-sight for the time it would
take a disease to run it's course?  Imagine a mage following his victim
everywhere.  Pretty soon the victim will either attack the mage out of
frustration or call the local constable to take care of this wacko.

** Re: Rob  <STURNKIN%EKU.bitnet@uunet.uu.net>

     I'ld say illusionary armor works assuming the opponent believes it.
It'ld be like the shield spell that way.  Of course if the mage then casts a
spell the opponent would get a pretty good modifier to disbelieve the
illusion (he know's mages don't wear armor).

     I'ld also give him a new save everytime he would have hit the mage but
didn't because of the illusionary AC.  That simulates the chance that the
mage doesn't understand as well as his opponent the way armor reacts when
struck.

** Re: Bill Barney <IDWXB%ASUACAD.BITNET@pucc.PRINCETON.EDU>

Trust bill to come up with the really pertant question:
"So what would be the effect of an illusionary chainmail bikini?"

     The enemy would probably die laughing!  So illusions can kill! ;-)

The idea of illusions having real effects is based on the apparent fact that
the mind can cause physical changes to one's OWN body without apparent physical
input.  In other words, you feel pain in your mind; thus a mind affecting spell
can make you feel pain even if nothing touches you.

Your mind CAN'T affect your external surroundings.  Thus if the orc saw a mage
wearing armor, he might believe it is real, but his belief would not MAKE it
real because the armor is a physical object outside the sphere of influence
of the orc's mind.  By the same token, you might by illusion convince the orc
he can fly, but he will not really be flying and he will not go anywhere; he'll
just stand on the ground and flap his arms.

On the other hand, if you attack that same orc with a sword and the orc
believes it's real, the orc will expect to feel pain when hit.  The brain can
feel pain without outside intervention!  That's within its sphere of influence.
So the illusionary sword will have a real effect; the illusionary armor won't.

Another way of looking at it is that the illusionary sword acts on the orc.
The mage's illusionary armor acts on the orc's sword.  Since the orc's sword
is nonsentient, it cannot be affected by the illusion.  If the orc were to
beat on the mage with his fist, the "armor" might cause pain to the orc--but
it still would not protect the mage a bit!

Well, I do allow illusions to kill, but it is very difficult. The first
time an illusion does something that would cause damage (were it real),
the victim is allowed another save. If it fails, the victim believes
he/she has been injured, and the damage is recorded seperately from 'real'
damage that the victim has taken. Any additonal attacks by the illusion
against the victim grant no free saves. If the victim should ever fall
unconscious from damage sustained, no problem; they are out. If the
real and illusionary damage totaled kills the character (less than
-10 in AD&D, or if a death roll is forced and failed in GURPS), roll
vs HT+5 in GURPS or make a system shock roll in AD&D. If the roll fails,
the person suffers major heart attack or stroke, and dies.

I'm sorry, Dave, but your friend was having a bit of fun at your expense.
Acid, indeed, *any* psychodelic drug does *not* "allow one to see illusions
unleashed by his subconcious mind".  It does subtly alter ones perceptions but
in no way would make a phone seem as if it were about to attack or pink
elephants jump out of the walls.  That sort of thing is an unfortunate fallacy
that many people share.  The actual effects of psychoactive drugs are very
subtle; i.e. if one does not concentrate one will not realise much is going on
at all.  The colors of the room may seem brighter, the sounds of Beethoven's
9th may seem more immediate, you may even be able to concentrate on the
minutest of detail for periods of time.  Also, acid does not "distract" as the
pink elephant argument suggests, ones perceptions are not "flawed".  A person
under the influence of psychodelic drugs, basically, is *more* aware than you
are I.  (An opposite effect from narcotics such as beer.)

A quick comment:

     I had said I felt illusionary armor would work.  This is the rationale
(not that magic needs to be rational - it is magic): If the opponent believes
that the sword he's weilding has struck armor it can't penetrate wouldn't he
subconciously stop his swing in order to pull back and swing on a differnt
area where he might be effective?  Affording the "wearer" of such armor at
least some protection?  There are a lot of problems with the realism of
this:  Someone weilding a mace vs illusionary plate would probably not
stop the swing, etc.  But AD&D combat is pretty inexact anyway.

     I'ld be willing to allow it with the provisions mentioned before plus
the comment that the first time the mage actually gets hit the spell is
likely to break from his lack of concentration.

     It doesn't seem a particularly useful application of an illusion anyway.
Any mage who finds himself in melee and uses an illusion spell to create
armor instead of using it to get himself out of combat is in deep sneakers
anyway.

Dave Wetzel:  You say that you would not allow a disease or heart attack
illusion to work because of the lack of knowledge on the part of the
victim of how diseases etc work.  Would you let an illusion of a magic
missile work on a grunt fighter who doesn't understand how magic works?
(I still don't understand how you could cast the illusion of a heart
attack--at least not if illusions are supposed to be externally observable).
I would think that a disease like Bubonic plague (which many people in the
middle ages were all too familiar with) could cause death (in a campaign
where illusions cause death) because 1) it creates observable effects--
the black "buboes," and 2) the victim would (probably) know it is fatal.

Dave Boddie:  No, I don't think we were "throwing and missing the mark"
about illusions.  Most of us were responding directly to Tabby's question
which assumes that illusions can kill.  The discussion has now shifted, and
I agree with many people that the easiest and best way (in terms of game
balance and consistant interpretation of spell effects) to run illusions
is to rule that they are only observable hoaxes, like holograms, etc.

David Giridot:  I run illusions in a similar way.  "Programming" an illusion
would be very difficult.  If the caster was controlling the illusion, s/he
might be able to program it to respond the way it would be expected to, but
if the illusion is to be cast and then left unattended, it would be hard to
cover all the bases.  In some game systems it may be possible to have another
kind of programmed illusion which is linked with a telepathy magic.  This
sort of spell would be very difficult, but could make the illusion act the
way the victim expected it to (like the Star Trek episode "Shore Leave").

The following is my own estimation of how illusions should work, and I do not
propose to say that it is *the* way; only to offer a possible viewpoint.
Having said that...

                        ILLUSIONS

Illusions are, simply, a pattern woven by the caster of the illusion, that has
an effect similar to hypnosis on the minds of all but the caster who percieve
the pattern.  These patterns may be woven of a number of different varieties
each with their differing effects.  Whatever the type though, all hold a few
characteristics in common.

First of all, the reality the pattern produces is
_entirely_in_the_mind_of_the_beholder_.  Such a contention is fairly simple to
understand until one considers the added complexity of multiple beholders.
Suppose a pattern is woven onto victim 1 such as that his hair is on fire.
Victim 2 sees this.  There are two possible outcomes.  First: victim runs
around screaming and victim 2 wonders what all the fuss was about.  Second:
victim 1 runs, and victim 2 is alarmed that victim 1's hair is on fire.
However, mindless objects cannot be affected by the pattern.  So what if
victim 2 pours some water on victim 1's head?  The water doesn't know victim
1's head should appear to be on fire.  If the pattern were not sufficiently
complex to recognize the action of water and know to fizzle out it is entirely
concievable that to our victims, the water will appear to have no effect.
Addtionally, unless the pattern is sufficiently complex to dictate that victim
1's hair will begin to show the damage that fire will produce, victim 1 will
not suffer any beyond a general sort of upset.

Thus, we see that an illusion is limited by the complexity of its own pattern.
 A pattern sufficiently complex can have truly amazing effect.  Consider a
sort of pattern woven onto a victim such that he perceives his hair is on
fire, such that if not "put out" by water, etc. it will begin to burn his head
and skin, such that eventually the damage will be so great that the victim
will die.  The effect of such an elaborate illusion would, at best, knock out
the victim if he could not put the fire out (he would appear to be consumed by
flame).

The simplest pattern to create is known as an Image.  An image affects only
the eyes of all who behold it.

A complex pattern is whats known as a Program.  This is an "interactive" image
that comes in two varieties, and is often quite complex to affect all senses
and have a limited interaction with the inanimate similated by fooling the
mind.  This is accomlished in the example already mentioned.  A fire Program
could be made such that it fizzeles when it comes in contact with water.
Programs tend to come in two varieties, depending upon whether their effect is
Internal, or Complex.  Internal affects individuals.  I.E.  a fire Program
Internal would cause victims to percieve fire, but they could dismiss the
Program by the fact that each would not notice the program's effects on the
other.  Needless to say, Internal is the easiest program.  A Complex Program
not only works internally, but externally also, so that a number of victims
experience the Program collaboratively also.  Complex programs are inherently
difficulty, especially with tactile programs experienced by a large number of
individuals.

Patterns remain as long as they are energised by the caster, with one
exception.  Their memory may remain in the victim's mind long after the
pattern has ceased to exist, and this may "self-simulate" the patterns
internal effects indefinitely.  Example, consider a a warrior entirely too
sure of himself.  He becomes victim of an Internal Program such that he is
especially skilled against demonkind.  Because of his own hubris, the danger
is that the warrior may continue to beleive the pattern long after it is gone.

A pattern can only be as complex as it is designed to be.  The difficulty of
creating and maintaining a pattern is proportional to its complexity.
General, anything beyond Images requires months of research and effort to gain
the expertise neccesary to weave a good pattern.  Note that patterns, once
reseacrhed, can then be used easily.  Think of Pattern Programs just like a
computer program, though.  Even at the expert level, it takes hours of
programming to create a pattern that works properly.

One last note, Illusion Patterns are the basis of real magic.  I.E, they are
creation of the unreal, whereas magic can create the real.  Illusions, because
they create so little reality, are (besides the time) quite easy to make.
Magick, because it creates real change in the world (for however long) is more
difficult.  However, there is a third category of creation that is between the
two.  Call it a quasi-real pattern.  It is creation that is not real as far as
the universe is concerned, and yet is.  At any rate, the secret of its
creation is carefully guarded, if it exists at all -- for the technique allows
the de facto creation of magic without any effort.  There is, however, a
price.  It is as if the universe is tricked into accepting the quasi-pattern,
and then realises its mistake (to late to extract energy from the magician).
Well, the universe must balance things somehow, so the fabric of reality is
altered slightly to accept the quasi-pattern.  An example in legend is of the
mage Kenephoreus creating a quasi-real apple that caused the nose of king
Refuild half a world away, to turn blue.

The most successful patterns are those that are subtle rather than complex.
AN example is the Aprentice Yixor's enterprising spell of invisibility that
achieves the effect, not by complex warping of light and photo-displacement
effects, but my causing the mind to "shy away" from whatever is marked by the
pattern.

ON SUBSERVIENCE

Not only are womnen typically subservient in the
 "mostly-accurate-medieval-society" fantasy, they are also typically
sunservient in the _Conan_ series books, the _Gor_ books,
the _Tarzan_ books, the _Mars_ books, and any host of other "mighty thewed
barbarian" epics- which I think is the originating fantasy for the
chainmail bikini.

Even a lot, maybe most, of contemporary fantasy
involves some male character saving everyone through ther ingenuity and
skill.  But they are sensitive at least!;-)

There are notable exceptions- Mercedes Lackey is often so anti-male(hetero-
sexual male anyways) that it hurts.;-)  She represents the reflection, on
the other side of the "mighty thewed barbarian".  Marion Zimmer Bradley
often has strong female characters, and weak male characters.;-)
Even Robert Howard had his strong female characters- Red Sonya, and
Valeria for examples.

THE FOLLOWING IS MY THEORY:
I think it is mildly inaccurate to say that "the reality of the fantasy
genre *is* subservience in women" but it is MOSTLY true.  Why?  Much
of the classic proto-type fanatsy was written in a time when woman's
rights were just starting to be heard.   It was a time dominated by  male
authors.  Conan and Tarzan were the archetypes for much fantasy- thus their
prejudices and tendencies went with the archetype.   Although there is a
much MUCH stronger representation of women now in fantasy literature it is
still a new trend.  The new books coming out tend to be a lot more
"enlightened".

I, for one, will not mock the mighty thewed barbarian.  Yea, it is sometimes
testosterone-laden, sexist  violence- but it can be fun!;-)

In terms of art(oh yeah- we were talking about art!;-)) I also like Frank
 Frazzetta, but I tend to also be turned off by sniveling, subservient
females.  Though chainmail bikinis can be VERY attractive on some bodies!

ON ILLUSIONS

People do die from shock.  Stress, emotional pressure, and sudden sensory
stimuli can cause people to put physical pressure of their cardiovascular
 system.  It seems feasible to me that if someone were frightened enough
they could die of a heart attack.

I have no evidence that people die of fright except hearsay- but I have no
 evidence that they can't either, and the popular opinion is that they can.

The whole question of illusions killing people depends on what kinf of illusion
 they are.  MAgical illusions seem to come in three types:

1)
They effect your sensory organs and stimulate them so that you see, smell,
hear, feel things that are not really there.

I think this type of illusion would be the most difficult to kill with.
I think a person would only die if they were so terrified of dying that
they had a heart attack at the moment the illusion killed them(or
whatever).  I think it is unlikely.

This is how illusions in my campaign work.

2)
They effect the parts of your mind that interpret sensory data and make you
 believe you are seeing things.  This is mor epowerful as it involves
reaching into the persons mind and manipulating their thoughts.  It also allows
 the illusionist potential to access the subjective manner in which
the victim interprets the illusion.  In that sense the illusionist can make
an illusion inherently SCARY as opposed to cretaing an image that the
illusionist thinks will scare the victim.

This type of illusion would be easier to kill with because you could induce
fright and such strong emotions as to put a lot of stress on the perosn,
possibly leading to a stroke or heart attack!

DEpending on how much the GM thinks the mind controls the body it could
also cause bleeding from imaginary sword wounds, sores from imaginary
diseases, etc.

IN my campaign only very sophisticated enchanters can perform this type of
illusion and it usually requires a thorough understanding of the illusionary
magics and the enchantment magics(charm, hypnosis, cause emotion, etc.).

3)
This one is on the wierd side, and in my opinion does not belong in the
illusion discussion.  It is based on the concept that we make our own
reality.   ANd that if the illusionist convinces us of his reality
using his magics then whatecve rthe illusion is is real for whoever it is
cast on. SO basically if the character did not make a perception/
saving throw/magic resistance roll, or whatever, then they would be
enrolled in the illusionists reality and it WOULD BE REAL for them.

Many AD&D illusions seem to be based on this premise.  I think it is
far too powerful to even call it illusion- because if the character can
actually CHANGE the REALITY of his opponent then no magic is more powerful.
ALSO- this mechanism does explain how illusionary armor or weapons or
illusionary bridges could work.  The caster is just changing HIS reality.

I would recommend that spells of this type be scrapped form anyones campaign,
or at least made unbelievably hard.  (In AD&D terms I would add FIVE levels
to many of the illusion spells that are in this catagory.  The ones that
just effect senses are probably fine just where they are).

To answer questions like the plastic bag over the head choking someone and
dying of a long term illusionary illness, you have to decide what kind of
illusions exist and are possible in your campaign.  My reccommendations are
based on MY preference for a realistic, balanced campaign.  I have run
in really FUN campaigns where Phantasmal Forces(an AD&D spell that allows
you to create the illusion of anything in a fairly large area- it is also
the lowest level spell possible{outside of simple tricks and cantrips})
were thrown around like crazy- it just isn't the kind of campaign I would
run.


Tabby says:
>btw, my favorite interpretation of illusion was that Star Trek episode
>when they were in the wild west..  The illusory bullet killed Chekov,
>and then when Spock dispelled the illusion, he 'came back to life',

Actually Spock didn't dispel the illusion he mad eit possible for McCoy,
Scotty, and Kirk to see that it was an Illusion and not "REALITY"
That struck me as a carefully maintained and constabntlky supervised
illusion because CHekov didn't come back till the Melkotians(I think)
dispelled the illusion themselves.

I think it was a type II illusion!;-)

I JUST got Jeff's post about this!  I agree with it, of course!

Sharon:  You said you had a ranger who cast an illusion of a good foot
and then walked back to town with it (is that correct?)  If that is the
case, I wouldn't have let you do that, even if other people don't disbelieve
in it.  The fact is that the ranger *knows* that it is not real.  I would
rule that if a person *knows* that something is an illusion, they can ignore
the illusion's effects.  (Actually, I would run illusions completely
differently... :-)

	About a decade ago when I was running a D&D campaign, I thought up
two relatively nasty ideas involving illusions.  I used one on my players,
but never was nasty enough to use the other.  I think they might amuse you.

	The party broke into the house of a mysteriously vanished wizard.
They got to the magic library, which the wizard obviously didn't want people
messing with, so he cast a couple of illusions.  First, he cast the illusion
that the room was completely bricked up solid.  On top of that, he cast a
second illusion that the room was a dusty bedroom.
	Sure enough, the party ransacked the house, then said "this can't
just be a dusty bedroom--it must be an illusion."  Unfortunately, one of the
PCs was inside the room when he successfully disbelieved.  He found himself
encased in brick!  Now, years later, they are still trying to figure out what
is real and what is illusion.  Heh heh.

	The other idea I had hinges on the fact that (at least in 1st Ed
AD&D) there was a rule stating that characters gain no experience for killing
illusionary monsters.  My idea was to run them through a long, grueling
dungeon with a super-unbelievably-nasty monster at the end.  When the party
disbelieves in the much-too-tough monster, the entire (illusionary) dungeon
disappears, along with all their hard earned treasure and experience.
	I would not be writing this now if I had actually tried this one...

An excellent point which I had completely forgotten about!  In most games I
have played in or GMed, maintenance of an illusion requires full concentration
of the mage, so if the mage makes himself an illusionary set of armor, he
can then do nothing but stand there and maintain the illusion.  He can't cast
any more spells.  In AD&D anyway, mages (esp. low levels) often face the
problem of running out of spells and/or hit points and becoming virtually
useless.  Even so, I would imagine that it would make more sense to use your
last spell on something that would protect you and any other incapacitated
PC's (i.e. an illusion that you're "not there") than to blow it on something
as dicey as illusionary armor.  (Guess you could put illusionary armor on
someone ELSE without canceling his ability to act, but then see all my other
objections.)

Dave's other argument about 'subconsciously stopping his swing to hit somewhere
more effective' (a paraphrase)--well, it's a matter of opinion.  If you're
talking about subconsciously stopping a blow mid-swing, I doubt it.  If you
are talking about directing the swing to an area not covered or less covered
by the illusionary armor, I would agree, but I don't think it would be very
useful except in certain very specialized situations.

Re: "Geoffrey L. Hodge" <glhodge%UMASSMED.UMMED.EDU@pucc.PRINCETON.EDU>

>Dave Wetzel:  You say that you would not allow a disease or heart attack
>illusion to work because of the lack of knowledge on the part of the
>victim of how diseases etc work.  Would you let an illusion of a magic
>missile work on a grunt fighter who doesn't understand how magic works?

     Depends.  First let me say the grunt doesn't need to be able to do
magic, he just needs to understand that when the mage points those little
globs of light at someone they take damage.  Conversely, if the fighter
truely has never seen a magic missile, he wouldn't take damage.

     Here's why, the theory is that the illusion itself doesn't cause effect,
it's the believer's mind that does.  If the believer has no idea what the
effect of this object flying at him will be, he will take no effect from it.
He may cringe from it, not knowing if he's about to become a frog or perhaps
go insane, or get real weak, etc.  But when it hits, if he doesn't know what
will happen nothing will.

     For this reason, we've always played that certain spells can make good
illusions, but most can't.  Fireball is a good example of one that makes a
good illusion because it has a real, understandable, visual effect (being
encased in fire).  I can't image illusionary charm person (unless cast
against a mage who was watching the opponent cast and trying to figure out
what was cast and *believes* it was charm person and then fails his
"disbelieve" save despite his high int and then fails his normal save vs
charm person -- pretty bloody unlikely).

     I don't understand how the effect of a heart attack could be made
with an illusion either (except by making a good scary illusion appear:-).

     As for disease, if both the caster and the victim were healers or
otherwize had a real detailed knowledge of disesase, I suppose it could be
fatal.  But, again, what caster is going to follow his victim around for the
days/weeks/months/years it takes to die from the disease.  Even the plague
took days to actually die from.  The only way I could see this working is if
the two were in a town currently infected with a real nasty plague.  The
caster could cast the illusion of disease on his victim in hopes that the
townsfolk would believe it and toss the "infected" person on the fire with
the rest of the infected people.

     That's the real use of illusions, to make others react to something
that's not real.  Getting them to either achieve an effect for you or to
distract them from you and your friends.

     As an aside, I agree with you Jeff, the ranger with one foot would not
be able to walk on an illusionary one because he *KNOWS* it's not real.  You
can't take the benefit of an illusion you don't believe in just because you
want to believe.  And as GM, I'ld make sure you checked for belief the first
time you tried to use it (and I'ld make it an automatic failure, unless there
was a real good excuse to give the character a chance to believe).  Of course
if they had magically altered the ranger's memory (hypotism, et al),
convincing him that he never lost the foot, he'ld have a normal save to
believe the illusion.  I'm not sure I'ld let him walk on it afterwards
anyway.  I'ld have to think about that.

I feel I must point out that how a character would react to thinking that
she/he was dead would depend on that character's view of death and the
afterlife.

ok.. I know you're sick of this topic, but I want to answer some of the
questions directed at me.  Mainly, to be more specific about how I *do*
run illusions.

The illusion is entirely in the believer's mind.  If an illusory ton of
bricks fell on a believer, he would believe he was dead and act accordingly.
Witnesses who believed the ton of bricks would believe he was dead and act
accordingly.  So if everyone around thought he was dead, he would lie there,
not moving, metabolism slowed almost to death, until he starved, died of
thirst, or someone dispelled the illusion that he had died.
(Once again, I am reminded of the Star Trek where Chekov died from an illusory
bullet, but Spock dispelled the illusion, bringing him back to life.)

So, ok, if a mage wore illusory armor, a blow would still hit him for full
damage, but the victim might think it bounced off the armor, and would swing
even harder the next time.  If he gave someone else the armor, that person
would get hit and think that he hadn't, and might stand there thinking he
was invulnerable until he really died.  If a ranger believed he had an illusory
foot, he would think he was walking along, when really he would be hobbling
along pathetically, doing horrible damage to his stump.  If he had an entire
illusory leg, he would think he was walking along, when really he'd be doing
the curly shuffle.  A mage could create an illusion that he is wielding a
sword, and if he struck a killing blow to a believer, the believer would
believe he was dead:  same as the ton of bricks above.  Ok, so if plague
was common in the world, and someone did Maintain an illusion of plague on
a believer for long enough, i would rule that the believer would think he
was dead.


Ok, Now I have another question:  Have there been any actual instances of
someone under hypnosis being made to believe they had died??   If so,
what happens??  This might shed some light on the subject....

So, Tabby, did you get the "more intelligent" discussion you wanted?  :-)

One thing no one's mentioned directly, but several people have perhaps alluded
to is psychosomatic effects.  Basically, a psychosomatic illness is a *real*
illness caused by a person's mind.

How might this transfer over into the illusion discussion?  Well, if a person
thinks he's sick because he appears to have a disease, he may well make himself
truly physically sick.  If he sees an arrow sticking out of his chest, with
blood flowing from the wound, his mind may well create the pain such a wound
would cause -- but if he's never had such a wound, the amount of pain his mind
would create could be much greater or lower than it "should" be.  (Okay,
explanation via game mechanic:  an arrow does 1d6 damage.  If the victim here
has never been hit by an arrow before, his mind could cause 1d4 or 1d8 of "pain
damage" as easily as 1d6.)  The aforementioned fighter who's never seen a magic
missle could possibly die if he perceives the missle as lethal magic, or not
even bat an eyelash if he perceives it as nothing more than a little light-
bolt.

As far as people having heart attacks due to fright, I read something about
that in an issue of _Discover_ magazine several years ago.  I believe it said
that such things are not only possible, but at least implied if not stated that
fright-induced heart attacks have happened.

(Brandon:  I like your ideas for adnd mechanics for 'damaging illusions'.  They
just might get used tonight....umm, make that in about ten minutes; I'm late
already....)

I think the best way to handle the death-by-illusion would be to have the
character (victim) make a system shock check.  If the check is failed, the
character dies, or goes to 0 hp (unconscious (sp?)), or whatever.

On the topic of this illusion business, what would be the true limitations
of other spells?

Could a magic-user shape change into a virus that he knew is a cause of
a plague and kill an entire town if not country-side?

Normal illusions should not be able to kill.  There are the more powerful
spells that do that.  A normal illusion could fool someone into thinking
that they have been killed and the shock could send them into
unconsciousness (Dm's option) but on the question if they die, they may
be given a system shock roll to avoid the heart attack idea of the scare
of dying.  But I would say that at that instant (if they make their first
system shock roll to avoid unconsciousness) that the illusion is broken.
The reason behind this is the idea "I should have been killed.  What
happened?".  At that moment that doubt enters the persons mind the
illusion is broken...  They are sitting thier with pieces of them
hanging all over (all illisionary) and they are fine.  They could have
an arm blown off and if they fall to the ground and throw their arms out
to catch themselves (a reflex to throw out both) then both will catch
them and they will feel an invisible force holding them up where their
arm used to be.  Again, the idea of that instant of doubt...  To do
anything otherwise makes low level illusion spells more powerful than
a power word kill that is an 8th level spell (I think)...  this is most
non-triumphant (for the villians that is, hahahahahahaha)....

        I suffer from being a few timezones away from you all, so I get huge
bundles of mail when I log in - it also means that other people get to say
all the wonderful things i wanted to say. (Sob, sob)

        Illusionary Armour - well, if you believe that it is real and can
protect you, your mind may well make some changes to the damage you suffer
to reflect that -- and it must work both ways - if an illusion can convince
your mind that you are hurt, then it can also convince your mind that you
aren't, and you won't be.

        However, you obviously can't cast Illusionary armour on yourself,
becuase you would know that it was an illusion, wouldn't you? So a mage has
to cast it on a fighter and not tell the fighter that it is an illusion.

        This pretty much wipes out that ranger with his illusory foot,
doesn't it? and even if someone else cast it for him, and said it was a
"healing" spell, there is no way anyone could maintain a permanent illusion
of that complexity beyond concentration time.

        Actually, given the complexity required for a killing illusion -
it would have to fool several senses simulataneously, it would almost always
have to move convincingly and be "done" with a lot of artistry and skill, they
would be very rare. Since very few of us can, with time, draw a brick that
looks real, then people who can whip up a ton of falling bricks on demand
would be rare. The most regular, and useful, use of illusions in campaigns
I've played in has been to subtly alter the lightening or sound in a limited
area. The worst we ever ran into was last session, in the "halls of the High
 King" where the three watevertheycallem in 2nd Ed hit us with three
different killers simultaneously - the old crushing walls was one - and
all we lost was a few swords, whanged off walls that had illusions cast on
them.

Hi there folks,
	I spend one day away from the office and you people get a really
interesting discussion on illusion going ! I can't leave you alone
for more than a minute !

	I have thought about illusions and their effects for many years,
ever since I first came across AD&D techniques of handling illusion
as a different type of magery that did more damage to an indeterminate
number of people in an unspecified and internally inconsistent manner.

	The end result of all this is that I tend to view all illusion
as mind affectting and not environment affecting. Thus an illusion
can only affect what the mind can effect.

	This limits an illusion to affecting the mind and, indirectly, the body
of the affected character.

	That is what ILLUSION magic can affect. If the caster instead
chooses to use light to create an image rather than directly affecting
the mind of the target, that is not illusion magic, that is light
magic. Of course a good illusionist will use both the strengthen the
effect desired.

	There is no doubt in my mind that the mind has the ability
to affect the body greatly. There are documented cases of death
caused from fright. They seem to be VERY hard to induce externally
but supposedly it can be done. By the same token hypnosis is supposed
to be capable of allowing surgery to be performed on unanesthesized
patients. SO it is possible to block pain. And of course there is a
common belief in the "placebo" effect and in psychosomatic illness
and injury. The mental stretch to the concepts implied by illusion
not that large.

	The problem with illusion is in creating a pattern of magic that
is an accurate duplication of all of the perceptions and effects
of the event the caster is trying to mimic. An illusion of a spear that
does not correctly mimic the perceptions and stimuli of a real spear
is less likely to cause the body to respond as if it had been speared.
If there is enough confusion to cause themind to reevaluate and sort
out the signals it just recieved, then the fake spear is less likely
to do more than cause the recipient to pause.

	So one key in illusion becomes experience, the more experienced
the caster is
the more effective their casts become. If you are in a high detail
campaign you may want to require the caster to have rankings in each
of the various effects they intend to use.
	For this reason a mage can usually do a convincing illusion
of themself. Other illusions will depend on who is facing them.
A mage that casts a fighters image will do best against those
who are less famailiar with fighters and the manner in which
they move and act.

	Another key becomes time. If the target has the time to take
in all the elements of an illusion then they will have time to see the
inconsistentcies. Thus a quick effect is more likely to be accepted
easily.

	Saving throws are always a headache with illusion since it is never
clear what a saving throw really represents. As far as I am concerned
it is nothing more than a perception roll.  If something abnormal
is noted about the illusion it is couched in terms that describe it
in a way consistent with how well the roll was made.

	Example:

	A person running around a corner into an illusionary wall gets to roll
a perception roll.

	1) He makes the perception roll(barely) , realizes he is about to hit it
, and makes all the appropriate physical actions to avoid it. If he/she
hits it, there will be some damage ( assuming the mage was not a complete klutz)
 as the characters mind had enough input from the wall to convince him
that he ran into it. End result: a dazed person wandering around without a mark
 on him or
her until some bruising appears.

	2) He fails the perception roll, he doesn't see the wall at
all, runs through it. The character still has to deal with the effects
of the illusion trying to stimulate his mind into believing they
have run into a wall.

	3) They make the perception roll(critically) and realize the
wall is "wrong" . DEcides to run ythrough it. The character still
has to deal with the effects of the illusion but they have an edge
on any rolls they make because of the knowledge about the wall.


	With the above as a background I would like to respond to
some of the ideas I have been reading.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

I would tend to classify phantasmal armour as a simple force casting and
not an Illusion.

I tend to think that all illusions are programmed to a greater or lesser extent
. The real key is how familiar the caster is with a given effect.
A good illusionist would have to be an expert observer ! Admittedly the
depth of the rppogramming would be dependent on how much time and energy
the caster put into it but it is certainly possible for a mage to cast
an illusion of himself (as he/she views themself) that would fool
most people and handle limited conversations.
