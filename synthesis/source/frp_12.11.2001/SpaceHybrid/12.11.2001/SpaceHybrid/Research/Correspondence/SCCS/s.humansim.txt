Hello there Mr. Nimeroff,
     
This is completely out of left field but I noticed your signature on 
some netnews the other day so I thought I would ask a quick 
question.

I am interested in gathering basic information to be used to produce 
fairly simple models of human/animal behaviour. This includes 
information on perception and fatigue, reaction and action speeds, 
decision making, and general mechanics/physiology.

I have been working on this for a few years but this is the first I
have heard about the "Center for Human Simulation".

My questions are simply : What is it that the center does and how 
would you suggest I go about getting an overview of the research it 
has done ?

Thank You,
   Jim Mochel
