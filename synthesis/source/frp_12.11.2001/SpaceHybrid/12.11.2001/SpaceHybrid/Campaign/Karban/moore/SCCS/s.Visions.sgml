        Just after the Visitation by the Lazarine
        </title>
        <formalpara><title>Scene 1</title>
            <para>
            A (blinding) flash of sunlight reflects off the (bright blue) ocean in front of you as you walk above the water.
            Your outstretched finger accuses; 
            The (green) island in front of you disappears and a (soundless) wave of light and noise washes over you as the
            sun erupts from its center.

        <formalpara><title>Scene 2</title>
            <para>
            A single man (the survivor) remains ahead of you. Your horse hurtles through the village among (scattering, cheering)
            crowds. He turns and bares his teeth as your dogs (the crowd) brings him to bay. His (lightning wreathed) spear ricochets
            off of your armour. He slumps as the crossbow bolt appears in his chest. The lowered crossbow brushes your leg. His
            blood sparks as his powercells discharge and a double spiral of wire hangs from his throat.

        <formalpara><title>Scene 3</title>
            <para>
            Your pursuer slows. He turns (sliding) to follow you. His (matte black) scullcap shifts and falls from his head to
            the (pale blue, glowing ) ice. You fall and reach only to be caught (at the neck) by his (skeletal) left hand and you
            feel a (cold, expanding) pain as his (raven feather) quill drives into your (right) side. As his left hand pulls away the
            ink drops from the quill. The (black) drops blot out the (glowing) ice.
            </para>

        <formalpara><title>Scene 4</title>
            <para>
            Your (crowned) visitor kneels. His (raven) haired wife and his (blonde) daughter crouch (prepared, waiting) behind him. His men
            tense as you reach (motionless) for your herbs. The (red haired, youngest) daughter stands, looking (unhearing) to the
            stars above the hut.  A flick of the jimsonweed settles to the surface of the (steaming) caldron. The youngest turns (away) as
            the (screaming) visitor kicks the (frozen) caldron aside and his outstreched sword (streaming blood) falls from
            flickering (unmoving) fingers.
