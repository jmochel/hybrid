A Quick recap of where you are and what you are doing
=====================================================

You are mission "Fallen Angel"


Where
=====================================================
System Name: Hell

The Twin suns are Red Giants (Asmodeus/Baezelbub).
One Planet: Satan
Six Major Planetoids: Mammon, Angelus, Belial, Necros, Succubus

Three Known Transition Points : "Hell-4", "Hell-9" , and "Hell-13"

2 Coporations currently have a colony share of the system
---------------------------------------------------------
Stellar Engineering 30,000 Personnel, ~1,000 Security (Mercs)

C.O.O. Alex Kramden

Plump, self satisfied, believes that Mushima Star took the Nav 
Computer and sabotaged the Nav Bouys. Considers the Unions Helpless.

2.I.C.: Renault Avina 

Politically Savvy, Lean and Hungry. Considers the unions helpless. 


Mushima Star 20,000 Personnel, ~700 Security (13 Artifacts, 40 Robots)

C.O.O : Arl Rejonis
2.I.C : Leslie Crusher

Both appear to take the UMW-999 very seriously. But they 
consider the loss of the 2 nav bouys to be Stellar Eng work.
They also consider the Ys'Dak threat to be real. They are still 
suspicious of the task force , but only at a minor level.
