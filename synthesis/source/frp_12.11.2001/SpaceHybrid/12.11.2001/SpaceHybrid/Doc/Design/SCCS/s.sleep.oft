TITLE

	Sleep Deprivation 

KEYWORDS

	Sleep

BACKGROUND

	I was looking for some basic information about how lack of sleep 
affects alertness and efficiency. Especially for those characters that offer 
to take two watches in a row after a long day of combat.
	Most of the information available seems to deal with periods without
sleep of 30-60 hours or more. Little has been done about studying people who 
only sleep a small amount repeatedly for an extended period of time. 

DETAIL

	Sleep deprivation causes periodic lapses in efficiency. Thus
and individual will falter, recover for a period of time and then falter
again. The lapses are visible after 30 hours without sleep and become
worse until the point of approximately 100 hours without sleep, at which
point most people are pretty much at zero efficiency. After this time 
the individual may suffer from visual or auditory illusions and other
decay of rationality.
	
	This causes reaction times to change by lengthening the tail of the 
bell curve. End result is that the individual's fastest times stay about 
the same but the number of slower reaction times increase.

	Basic reactions and simple perceptual tasks are the most affected.
Simple calculations and communication tasks show effects after 60 hours 
or more without sleep. The most complex tasks show almost no efficiency 
loss (In terms of accuracy) even after 90+ hours without sleep.

	The less interesting a task is the more it is affected by sleep 
deprivation. 

Some sample performance levels for tasks performed after 60 hours
without sleep are shown below. 

Task						Level of Performance
Simple Reaction				7% 
Vigilance 					34% (over whole test)
Vigilance 					4% (last half of test)
Chess						51%
Darts						97%
Table Tennis				100%

	Amphetamines have been demonstrated to remove much of the reaction time
decay but only for short periods. A tolerance to them very quickly 
builds up.

	After prolonged periods without sleep individuals sleep for 9 to
12 hours. 

GAMING EFFECT

The thing that struck me the most in compiling this is that the reaction 
speed of an individual is the most drastically affected. Accuracy seems to
be much less affected. The only area other than reaction speed where I would 
bother to model the effects of sleep deprivation is in basic perception 
rolls.
