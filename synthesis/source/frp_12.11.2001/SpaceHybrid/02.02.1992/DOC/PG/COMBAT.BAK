\chapter{Combat Mechanics}

The combat section details the types of actions that may be taken 
while in combat. The chapter on General Play Mechanics must be 
understood before working with the combat details.

\section{Description}

Combat normally occurs on a pulse by pulse basis. The process is 
fairly simple: Determine First Reaction. For each of those reactions in 
order determine the action or attack, the damage from the attack ( if 
any), the secondary effects of that damage ( if any). Take a breath. 
Continue. 

\section{First Action Determination}

As detailed in the chapter on General Play mechanics. Perception
is rolled, initiative is determined and actions are chosen.

\section{Attack}

\subsection{Closing to Attack}

When attacking someone with a weapon of greater reach than theirs a 
character must close to get in range to strike. If the opponent is aware 
of the attack and has a viable initiative he may actively resist the 
closing action. To do so he must make an skill roll using a weapon to
fend the attacker off. 

It is treated as any other attack form and all active defenses can be 
performed against it.

If a character that has closed with their opponent is unarmed 
they may proceed to grapple, to throw, or to overbear.

If the defender wishes to simply retreat they may do so. They 
may do so by rolling to fend off the closing action at a DF +3. 
Of course, they do end up moving backwards. 

If an attacker has been closed upon they may choose to drop their 
current weapon and use a shorter one, they may choose to use their
current weapon as if it were a club, or they may attempt to retreat.

\subsection{Calculating Chances to Hit}

The attack has a chance to hit that comes from the SC of the weapon and
is modified by the DF of the environment and also the defense of the
person being attacked. Melee 
weapons base all their attacks on PCA. Missile and thrown weapons 
base all their attacks on ACC. 

Mental actions performed against inanimate objects is based on FCS
and mental attacks against an entity are based on MCA.

\subsection{All out attack}

A character may choose to perform an all out attack and thus gain 
DF +3 to his attacks and lose his MDF or PDF. This is simply an
extension to the concept of applying Total Concentration as detailed 
in the General Play Mechanics chapter.

\subsection{Called Shots}
 
In any physical targeted action there is the potential to specify the 
location of the strike. That of course entails modifiers to the 
actions DF. Shots to the head DF -12, To the Chest -6, To the Hand -15.
To the Arm or Leg EF -8.

!!!! Remember to add decreasing locale rules

\subsection{Hit Location}

The target number is calculated, the roll is made. If the attack
is a success then the damage is applied against the armour and then
the target.

All hits are checked against the hit location table.

\begin{stable}{Hit Location}{cl}
	Roll		   &  Location \\
	01-06		   &  Head \\
	07-30		   &  Chest \\
	31-48		   &  Abdomen \\
	49-56		   &  Groin \\
	57-64		   &  Right	  Upper Leg \\
	65-72		   &  Left	  Upper Leg \\
	73-78		   &  Right	  Lower Leg \\
	79-84		   &  Left	  Lower Leg \\
	 85		   &  Right	  Foot \\
	 86		   &  Left	  Foot \\
	87-89		   &  Right	  Upper Arm \\
	90-92		   &  Left	  Upper Arm \\
	93-95		   &  Right	  Lower Arm \\
	96-98		   &  Left	  Lower Arm \\
	 99		   &  Right	  Hand \\
	 100		   &  Left	  Hand \\	  \hline
\end{stable}

\subsection{Indirect Fire}

Indirect fire (i.e. a Lob) requires an additional DF -2. 
!!!! Figure out more about lobs.

\section{Damage}

\subsection{General Notes}

All damage is calculated and then applied to the location specified 
by the hit location table. If that area is armoured the damage is 
first applied to that armour. If the damage is great enough to get 
past the armour, the damage is then applied against the 
appropriate type of Fatigue such as PFT or MFT and then against the 
PBD or MBD of the entity. 

If the weapon has any secondary effects suchs as knockback or radiation
they are applied and calculated. 

\subsection{Critical Damage}

Any attacks that cause critical damage apply the additional damage to 
the PBD or MBD after armour.

\subsection{Types of Damage}

There are several types of damage. There is Crushing, Cutting, 
Piercing, Projectile, Laser, Energy, and explosive damage. Each one 
is typically associated with a specific weapon type. 

\begin{relate}
	\item[Crushing Damage]
	Crushing damage is damage caused by low speed blunt weapons such as 
	a club, a staff, a fist, or a chair. 

	\item[Cutting Damage]
	Cutting damage is caused by the use of slicing or chopping motions 
	with an edge weapon. 

	\item[Piercing Damage]
	Piercing damage is caused by low speed pointed objects entering the 
	body along the axis of the point. 

	\item[Projectile Damage]
	Projectile damage is caused by objects moving at high speeds. The 
	only real difference between piercing or crushing and projectile 
	damage is that the weapon moves at a high speed and imparts a
	high amount of kinetic energy to the target.

	\item[Laser Damage]
	Laser damage is caused by optical lasers. Damage caused by 
	non-optical lasing devices such as Masers and X--lasers is classified 
	as Energy damage. 

	\item[Energy Damage]
	Energy damage (abbrev. NRG) is typically associated with non-optical 
	electromagnetic weapons. 

	\item[Explosive Damage]
	Explosive damage is, quite logically, caused by explosions. It is 
	the result of a expanding wave front of gasses or minute particles.

\end{relate}

\subsection{Secondary effects}

There are several types of secondary effects. There is knockback, 
bleeding, and Shock.

\subsubsection{Knockback}

Knockback is the result of a high amount of kinetic energy being 
imparted to the entity taking the damage. It is only necessary when 
more than half of the entities PFT or PBD is taken away in a single 
attack by a crushing or projectile attack and is always assocaited 
with an explosive attack. The Knockback resistance roll is DF -1 with a
gain of no Knockback. If failed the entity is knocked to the ground. 
The stat basis is typically PST or PAG whichever is greater.

\subsubsection{Bleeding}

Bleeding is the result of a cutting or piercing attack that has done 
actual PBD damage. The Bleeding resistance roll is DF -3 with a target 
of no serious bleeding. If failed the end result is 1 point of PFT loss to 
bleeding per 20 pulses. The stat basis is PEN. 

\subsubsection{Shock}

Shock is the state brought on by massive disruption of the nervous 
system of the entity. Shock effects range from the minor (stunned) to 
the major (being unconcious). 

Shock secondary effects are made possible by any attack that causes 
either PBD or MBD damage or by specific energy weapons such as Charged
particle or TASER weapons. 

A system shock roll is made against PEN or MEN. 

\section{Defenses}

\subsection{Passive Defense}

\subsubsection{Rolling with the blow}

The act of rolling with the blow involves an attempt to take the 
allotted damage but absorb it in such a way that the normal secondary 
effects such as stun or knockback do not take effect. The action 
requires no time but does require that the defender be aware of the 
attack and declare that he wishes to roll with the attack. The base 
roll goes against PAG for physical attacks and MAG for mental 
attacks. It adds DF +5 to the System Shock roll if any is made.

\subsection{Active Defense}

There are a number of forms of active defense. All entities, if they
are aware of an attack, may apply their normal defense against that
attack. This does not count as an action ! 

\subsubsection{Evasion}

Evasion involves the active avoidance of incoming attacks. For as long
as a PC is avoiding an attack or series of attacks their defense is \( 2
\times PDF or MDF \). The character need only declare that they are evading and it takes effect at
their first action point. Of course the character can perform other actions 
at the same time but they will be considered as florentine actions. The 
character is at a DF +3 when performing a dodge from an evading state.

\subsubsection{Dodging} 

Dodging is an extension of the normal defensive technique of getting out
of the way. Dodging implies that the PC is actively throwing himself out
of the path of an attack. It is a 10 pulse action and leaves the
character in the act of a controlled fall. A skilled individual may roll
to acrobatically recover. SB = PAG. DF -3. The gain is \( 3 \times PDF \).

\subsubsection{Dropping Prone}

A specialized form of Dodge that only works within a strong gravity
field. It is a five pulse action that leaves the character in a prone
position. Once down the character has 1/2 the normal PDF. 30 pulese 
are required to get back up.

\subsubsection{Crouching}

Crouching down can be used as a one time evasive manuever against an
incoming attack. It is a five pulse action that gives \( 2 \times PDF \)
against the attack. This is in lieu of full evasion. 

\subsubsection{Parrying}

The parray can be done with shield or weapon. DF -3, SB = Wpn SB, 
Gain = \( 2 \times Wpn SB in defense\). Speed as per wpn.
DF -5 against Thrown, DF -10 against Projectile, DF -20 against NRG.
This is simply a skill opposition roll. 

\subsubsection{Block}

Can be done with Weapon or Shield. 
DF -2, SB = Wpn SB, Gain = Wpn Damage in armour, speed as per wpn.

\subsubsection{Disarm}
DF = -4, SB = Weapon SB, GN = Save against disarm, speed as per wpn.

\subsubsection{Withdraw}

\section{Fancy Maneuvers}

\begin{stable}{Melee Combat modifiers}{ll}
	Spinning	   &		  DF -2 DAM 1.5* SPD 1.5* \\
	Jumping	   &		  DF -3 DAM 1.5* SPG 1.5* \\
	Speeding the strike &	  DF -0 DAM inverse to SPEED  \\
	Two Handed	   &		  DF -0 DAM 2.5* SPD 1.5  \\ \hline
\end{stable}

\subsection{Feint}

A feint is used to distract an opponent or to trigger an opponents 
preset actions. 

The main thing to remember that a feint is, in effect, a deception 
roll. It involves a weapon skill roll to convince the other 
individual that an attack is being made. The feint roll takes and DF 
of -6. All who are within range may roll to save against 
being fooled by the feint. 

This is considered an opposing skill roll so the amount the feinter makes
their roll by is subtracted from the feintee's perception roll.

\section{Close Conflict}

Once someone has closed to withing arms reach they may choose to do
any of the following.

\subsection{Overbear}

An overbear is simply performed by closing with an opponent and then 
making a normal attack using SB=PCA. Like any other attack it may be 
repulsed or actively countered.

The gain for such an attack is to have the opponent on the ground.
Damage for an overbear attack is simply equal to the attackers PSE.

\subsection{Throw}

A throw is simply performed by closing with an opponent and then 
making a normal attack using SB=PCA. Like any other attack it may be 
repulsed or actively countered.

The gain for such an attack is to have the opponent on the ground.
Damage for a throw attack is simply equal to the attackers PSE * 2. 
DF -5.

\subsection{Grapple}

A grapple is simply an attempt to get a hand hold on the opponent. 
It is like any other attack in that it may be countered normally.

A successful grapple gives a DF +5 modifier to any other close combat 
attack such as throw, overbear, and any attempts to increase the hold.

\subsection{Hold}

A hold is initiated by a grapple action and the initial strength of a
hold is given by the SN of the grapple. If the attempt to hold or 
immobilize someone is the sole aim of the attack then the attacker 
may choose to improve the hold by rolling again. For each attempt to 
improve the hold the attacker may only add 1/2 of the SN of the roll. 
No hold may be greater in strength than 5 * PST of the holder.
The opponent may reduce the strength of a hold by the SN of any 
grapple skill rolls he makes.
