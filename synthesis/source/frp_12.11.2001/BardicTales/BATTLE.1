Subject: WK Battle
     
Well Here is installment two of my Saga of the WK Battle a la Sigmund. 
I decided to skip directly to the "Inside the Citadel" Segment since 
that is were the most exciting Sigmund oriented activities happened.
     
A quick legend may help:

The Battle (as seen by Morphus and editted by Sigmund with notes from 
E-Man)
     
--- Segment One - Troop movements and the battle on the plains ---
        (Already described)
--- Segment Two - Advancing on the citadel ---
        (Skipped for now)
-- Segement Three - Sieging the citadel ---
        (Skipped for now)
--- Segement Four - Inside the citadel ---
     
[CC01] We moved in and down as quickly as possible.  We took no 
prisoners 
when decenta surrendered we killed them.
     
[JW01] We chose to take door #6 so that we would avoid meeting the 
Troll
in tunnel #5 even though we ended up metting it anyway.
     
[CC02] When we reached the point in the corridor that Morag remembered 
as 
where the troll was, she let us know and I let loose the Bolt.  It 
vaporized 
a couple hundred yards diagonally forward of us, but Dora used her 
hammer to
keep the ceiling from falling in on us (and especially Carl 
Wyvernsbane).
     
[JW02] If I recall the sequence of events was (a) Morag said "Troll" 
(b) Morphus began to release (c) Sigmund (or Mordenaith - I forget) 
yelled
"Down" and everyone immediately hit the dirt without hesitation. (d) 
The
Bolt of Damnation went off and Troll bits flew everywhere.  Quite an 
amazing example of tactical coordination in a wierd sort of way.
     
[CC03] When we finally got to the point where we thought the throne 
room was,
Pellius fell through a reality wall and got singed by a black dragon.
     
[JW03] I am a little foggy on this one.  We were just walking normally 
down
the corridor when Peleus and Carl just disappeared and everyone else 
stopped.  They were in a swamp reality with a huge Black Dragon who 
tried
to breath on them (how did they survive?).  We determined that it was a 
reality wall and Dora used the hammer with all of us supporting to push 
reality back to the way we expected it.
     
[CC04] We managed to get him out but when the wall went down, instead 
of seeing
the door to the throne room we encountered a death Lord and 
Decenta/preceptors.
     
[JW04]        Immediately after the reality wall went down we saw a 
death lord
standing in front of us with two preceptors standing behind him.  The 
Death
Lord cast a huge mass of death at the party.  The Preceptors were also 
casting but the results were not as immediately obvious.  Very soon 
after
the initial contact it became apparent that Kor-Keth was moving VERY 
slowly
and was effectively out of the action.
     
[CC05] Morphus cast a life blast at the Death Lord and Mordanith Shaped 
the 
Death Lords Dark blast into Life.
     
[JW05]        Something caused a hole in the middle of the Death Wall 
and
something else caused it to start getting larger.  At this point 
Sigmund
started speeding up and moving towards the fore.  Also a number of the 
front
rank fighters were dodging around the Death Wall and charging at the 
Death
Lord.
     
[CC06] Things got vague for Morphus.
     
[JW06] As Sigmund passed the Death Lord I believe he bit the big one 
under
the combined attack of Sterling, Pellius and Carl.  I do not remember 
what
Dora and Kelfi were doing during this period.  
     
[JW07] At some point around this time both Sigmund and Sterling pierced 
the 
1st reality wall and noticed that the DeathLord was not a DeathLord but 
a 
Decenta Captain, the two preceptors were also Decenta.  All of the 
above 
were not illusions but beings actually "will-altered" into other forms.
     
In addition to these decenta in the new context we could see six more 
decenta with high-tech div-goggles and two "real" preceptors who were 
warping the reality here.  Behind the two preceptors was a huge gate in 
the 
corridor (to where? - I don't know if we knew).  At this point Sigmund 
changed his target from one of the fake preceptors to one of the real 
preceptors and continued moving.
     
[JW08] Also at about this time Morag suddenly got distracted and 
decided to
walk through a wall that wasn't really there.  Sensing something (who 
knows
what) D'Jan followed her and Menahan tagged along to keep them safe.
     
[JW09] Sterling began moving down the left side of the corridor lopping 
heads off as she went. Snik (no fake preceptor) Snik (first goggled 
decenta
drops) ... I believe the last dissenta might have even taken two blows 
to
dispatch.  In the mean time Sigmund was weaving in between the Dissenta 
in
hyper-stealth mode and heading for the preceptors at the end of the 
corridor.
     
[JW10]  As sigmund approached the preceptors he ran through several 
reality
walls.  After the first he was on a blasted plain?, after the second he 
was 
under water, and after the third he was back in the original corridor 
just
entering through into the cathedral and he noticed the following thing.
 The
gate (which did not exist in the original corridor but was in the first
     
context shift instead) did not exist and instead the Real Death Lord 
was
standing right behind the first two preceptors with the Wizard King 
right
behind him with a Big Ugly Dog.  Behind the wizard king was Vardigan 
standing unchained with his arms crossed and behind him were two 
(four?)
more preceptors.  Behind all of this was a massive gate which openned 
onto
the plateau.  The Real Death Lord was in the process of casting a very 
major spell.  At this point Sigmund changed his target from the first 
real
preceptor to the Wizard King himself (after several long milliseconds 
of 
extreme adjitation over possibly killing off my character).
     
[CC07] Trevaine grabbed Morphus and falstaff (After slamming them to 
the ground),
and carried them into a hidden side corridor that Morag had found.  
     
[JW11] I do not remember what it was that stopped the Death Lord's 
spell
from being launched but I think it might have been Sterling.  In any 
case
by this point Sigmund was almost at the Wizard King.  The big doggy 
appeared
to be a big magical doggy because it noticed me coming in hyper-stealth 
mode and started to tug at the WK's robe.  At this point Sigmund was 
hyper
aware that anything could be a "will-altered" being.
     
[CC08] vartigan was lying there, near death, with three dead 
preceptors.  
He told us to beware of the gate.  
     
[JW12] Actually I think his discussions with Morag started long before 
Trevaine pulled the Mages away from the Death Lord's spell since 
talking 
scale is much longer than combat scale.  At some point D'Jan suddenly 
realized something and took off down the corridor at lightning speed 
(all the other Fortu seem to travel at much faster speeds than 
Sigmund).
     
[JW13] At this point sigmund was about to attack the wizard king when 
D'Jan comes screaming down the hall.  This signalled to me that 
something
was really wrong and sigmund invoked the Magnificat pages which Lenore 
had
instructed him would "make reality stable" and lo and behold the Wizard 
King was really not the Wizard King, the Vardigan figure behind the WK 
was the Real WK.  So once again Sigmund changed his target, stabbed the 
Wizard King, and immediately afterwards grappled him and started 
crawling
up his torso.
     
[JW14] I believe that stabbing the WK disrupted some sort of focus 
becuase
at this point I think the corridor became apparent as what it really 
was.
No wait, the reality wall must have dropped just prior becuase the 
party
saw Sigmund stab the "Vardigan figure" (or was that just PC's hearing 
what
was going on - I'm confused).  In any case I think Sterling moved on to 
the Real Death Lord and the mages which had congregated back in the 
hallway
began casting a major spell.
     
[CC09] Falstaff and I redirected the gates terminus from the 
Plateau to the courtyard of the flaming Heart Monastery.
     
[JW15] I think Mordenaith had a major part in that spell as well.
     
[CC10] Somebody (sigmund?) stabbed a vartigan look alike that was 
really a 
the wizard king and then started to seriously damage to him.  
     
[CC11] What we thought was the wizard king was really a 
preceptor/DeathLord?.
     
[CC12] (fill in blanks) 
     
[JW16] When the mages moved back into the corridor and shifted the 
gate runes Trevaine went back into speed mode and headed right at the 
Wizard King.  Trevaine ended up pushing the WK though the gate.  Also 
as
Pellius was just making it to the Cathedral a giant black shield came 
flying down the corridor followed by the running form of Lenore.
     
[CC13] the wizard king was pushed through into the courtyard and 
Pellious 
was able to channel Heimdells power through a sword blast that did 
significant damage to the Wizard King (others attack too).  (WK dies)  
     
[JW17] - Things I am missing from the description of this Segment
        ?? Who killed the Death Lords (Real and Fake)
        ?? Who took care of the right hand side decentas 
        ?? What were Dora and Kelfi doing during this time
        ?? Two of the preceptors were casting gold dust spells
                They made someone confront their worst fears (didn't
work)
                They did something else??
