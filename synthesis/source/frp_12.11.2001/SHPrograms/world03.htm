        <p>
          <font face="Verdana, Lucida Sans, Arial" size="-1">As many of you know, on Oct 26 I started off a discussion on SF Genres, basically asking people which they preferred, Hard-SF or Soft-SF. Responses came back indicating that Hard-SF was preferred predominantly over the more cinematic styles of Star Wars, Star Trek, and the rest of their Soft-SF ilk. It wasn't so much the technological level of Star Wars (versus, say, 2001) which bothered people. It was more the logical discrepancies, the &quot;gonzotech&quot; in Eric Tolle's words, and the &quot;annoying shallowness&quot; to paraphrase Phil Goetz. Neelakantan Krishnaswami argued that High-Tech is okay, but only insofar as it is rigorously thought out, not only in terms of technological repercussions but also in terms of the social and economic ramifications. Even Erol Bayburt, who preferred the cinematic style of Soft-SF, agreed that no matter how you bend (or break) science, the final result must, at least, be internally consistent.</font>
        <p>
          <font face="Verdana, Lucida Sans, Arial" size="-1">All these responses got me to thinking that if rigorous internal consistency is so highly prized, then we've got ourselves a whopper of a problem right off the bat. What problem? Fermi's Question, of course. And that was the central subject of my Nov 9 follow-up article.</font>
        <p>
          <font face="Verdana, Lucida Sans, Arial" size="-1">What is Fermi's question? Basically, stated, it's: &quot;Where are they?&quot;</font>
        <p>
          <font face="Verdana, Lucida Sans, Arial" size="-1">&quot;They&quot; as in the extra-terrestrials. Enrico Fermi, the nobel- prize winning physicist purportedly posed this question at a social dinner many moons ago, captivating his listeners with the perplexity of probabilities which argue that extra-terrestrials ought to exist versus the apparently obvious fact that they are nowhere to be found. For us modern-day munchkins, this isn't so much of a problem. We can rationalize the dilemma in any number of ways, the three most obvious being:</font>
        <p>
          <font face="Verdana, Lucida Sans, Arial" size="-1"><b>(1)</b> Extra-terrestrials don't exist, at least not in this galaxy. We are the one and only example of sentience anywhere in the Milky Way. The probabilities are just way less than people realize.</font>
        <p>
          <font face="Verdana, Lucida Sans, Arial" size="-1"><b>(2)</b> They do exist, but they can't visit us because of the imponderable difficulties of interstellar travel. And while they might be able to communicate with us, they've never seen any point in trying.</font>
        <p>
          <font face="Verdana, Lucida Sans, Arial" size="-1"><b>(3)</b> They do exist, and they have visited us, but they want to leave us alone for the time being and see how we do. If they do interact with our governments at all, it's behind the scenes, where they won't be noticed. As for us trying to tune in to their interstellar internet, there's really no point in trying. They use real-time fractal compression and spread-spectrum communications and tachyon pulses and whatnot, so don't even bother. We're not in the same league, much less the same ballpark.</font>
        <p>
          <font face="Verdana, Lucida Sans, Arial" size="-1">However, for the writer of a science fiction setting which is &quot;rigorously internally consistent&quot; and yet has a high-speed, cinematic, starwars/trekish, go-anywhere-and-quickly sort of flavor, we find that none of these rationalizations hold up. Number one doesn't hold up for obvious reasons. After all, there are aliens in Trek. Number two is weak. You mean we're the only ones to discover warp drive? And number three... well, if this were true, then any voyage into the unknown would stumble across some monstrously huge, tremendously ancient, and extraordinarily advanced alien civilization. Obviously, since humans dominate a huge section of space in Star Trek as well as Star Wars, probably the single two most famous SF settings to date (which is why they are being used in this discussion), one would think that this is not the case.</font>
        <p>
          <font face="Verdana, Lucida Sans, Arial" size="-1">So the questions is, how do we rationalize this inconsistency?</font>
        <p>
          <font face="Verdana, Lucida Sans, Arial" size="-1">I mentioned one possible solution from Michael McCollum's <i>Antares Dawn</i>, but forsake it as being too limiting on interstellar travel for my own personal tastes. Bertil Jonell, one of the more renowned of the TML denizens, replied with a whole laundry list of explanations. I've taken two of these and perverted them slightly.</font>
          <p>
            <font face="Verdana, Lucida Sans, Arial" size="-1"><b>(1)</b> Berzerkers: Some ancient space-faring civilization, the first boys on the block, in fact, decided to send out a huge armada of Berzerker robots. These robots were capable of self-replication through some fixed number of iterations. They were also loaded with all manner of nuclear armaments. When they'd detect the first signs of a possible competitive civilization, usually though reception of radio broadcasts and whatnot, they'd mosey on over and drop a few bombs. End of problem. Well, due to some error in the programming, the berzerkers in this section of the galaxy just sort of stopped functioning for some reason (who knows, maybe they became self-aware and developed moral qualms), so all of a sudden, we get lots of races popping their heads up at roughly the same time, and we Humans just so happen to be in this wave. Stumbling across one of these high-tech berzerker relics could be a major event of the campaign.</font>
          <p>
            <font face="Verdana, Lucida Sans, Arial" size="-1"><b>(2)</b> Battlefield Earth: Warring/Scheming High-Tech powers fight their battles indirectly, through puppet societies and various low-end civilizations. Earth (or the &quot;Terran Republic&quot;) becomes entangled in this conflict. We are supported by one power and embroiled in a war with other races which are supported by other powers. It may even be the case that Humanity was &quot;uplifted&quot; for this very purpose. In an odd sort of way, the situation is reminiscent of that of Gods settling their petty disputes though the races which they created and which they control.</font>
          <p>
            <font face="Verdana, Lucida Sans, Arial" size="-1">Bertil had some other interesting ideas, but I omitted them as they resulted in settings with a far different feel from what I'm looking for. Plus, a few of them seemed so bizarre that even Bertil admitted they were cop-outs.</font>
          <p>
            <font face="Verdana, Lucida Sans, Arial" size="-1">Richard Baker suggested another idea which I'll touch on briefly.</font>
          <p>
            <font face="Verdana, Lucida Sans, Arial" size="-1"></font>
          <p>
            <font face="Verdana, Lucida Sans, Arial" size="-1"><b>(3)</b> The NanoVirus: Way back when the first two civilizations had their great war, some whacko conceived and released a nanite (a microscopic machine) capable of infiltrating a lifeform of fairly broad parameters, replicating and surreptitiously spreading through the lifeform's species, and after a given delay, killing all the lifeforms with which it has come into contact. Hence, not only did it destroy the first war's winner, but as other civilizations came to inspect the ruins of that war, it infiltrated and destroyed their civilizations as well. The downside of this idea is that it is only a matter of time before it comes after us. &quot;Spock, look at this. These ancient records say that the Argoans were destroyed just like all those other civilizations.... by a little mach.... ack!&quot;</font>
          <p>
            <font face="Verdana, Lucida Sans, Arial" size="-1">While Geoffrey Grabowski felt this idea smacked of political statement, my only qualm with it is that it doesn't leave enough room for *lots* of aliens co-mingling in a vast interstellar community.</font>
          <p>
            <font face="Verdana, Lucida Sans, Arial" size="-1">Anders Sandberg suggested another option having to do with current worm-hole theory. &quot;If wormholes work as they appear to do in theory, an expanding wormhole empire will meet other empires at roughly the same era, regardless of their age and distance!&quot; (See <i>Traversable Wormholes</i> by Michael Price)</font>
            <p>
              <font face="Verdana, Lucida Sans, Arial" size="-1">I haven't yet taken a look at it, but I'm sure I will sometime in the near future. As for other reading/viewing material:</font>
            <ul>
              <li><font face="Verdana, Lucida Sans, Arial" size="-1">Neil Mackie suggests <i>2001 Nights</i>, a collection of Japanese graphic novels. An English translation is distributed by Viz comics.</font>
                <li><font face="Verdana, Lucida Sans, Arial" size="-1">Peter Tupper suggests David Brin's <i>Uplift</i> series which incidentally served as the basis for a GURPS supplement by the same name. He also suggests David Gerrold's <i>Chess with the Dragon</i>.</font>
                  <li><font face="Verdana, Lucida Sans, Arial" size="-1">Jim Cambias echoed Peter's comments regarding <i>Uplift</i>. He also suggested a new television series: <i>Earth 2</i>.</font>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                      <font face="Verdana, Lucida Sans, Arial" size="-1">Just to finish up the recap of responses, John Kim was annoyed over my intimation that SF campaigns should have aliens in order to be interesting. &quot;SF campaigns can be about anything: espionage, colonization, mystery, war, police work, trading missions, horror, and loads more.&quot; John also stated that advanced civilizations could stay hidden if they wanted to (for example, the Q-Continuum, ala Star Trek fame).</font>
                    <p>
                      <font face="Verdana, Lucida Sans, Arial" size="-1">As to the second point, I feel it ranks down there on the list of cliches. I think John actually felt this way as well, judging from his remarks.</font>
                    <p>
                      <font face="Verdana, Lucida Sans, Arial" size="-1">As to the first point, I apologize if I sounded like I was putting down anyone's campaign. I guess I'm wrapped-up in the idea of putting together an SF-setting with a StarWarzish flavor, and since that flavor necessitates aliens (and preferably lots of them), I've been steering the discussion in that direction.</font>
                    <p>
                      <font face="Verdana, Lucida Sans, Arial" size="-1">No disrespect intended to those of you who don't make use of aliens. I actually count myself among your number, as I've been steering away from aliens for several years now mainly because the Fermi question has been such a bother.</font>
                    <p>
                      <font face="Verdana, Lucida Sans, Arial" size="-1">It is worth noting that J.D. Frazer posted some details regarding his 21st century science-fiction cops campaign in response to the aliens issue. He was trying to show that you can have a perfectly good SF campaign without aliens, and it's true, you can. But, of course, for those of us who want to incorporate aliens due to whatever personal prejudices we hold dear, this bit of reasoning isn't extrodinarily helpful. Hence, while I felt his key point (and John's) was somewhat off topic, I felt his basic reason for steering clear of aliens to be very much on topic. Enough so that I'll do a full quote.</font><br>
                    <p>
                      &nbsp;
                    <pre>
&gt;Here's a problem: Introducing this super powerful alien
&gt;civilization means that the game has to take into account the
&gt;vast economic, social, psychological and technological
&gt;differences. Ferchrissakes, I can't even predict what *we're*
&gt;going to have a lousy 50 years from now. An advanced alien
&gt;civilization? By definition it would drift into the realm of
&gt;science *fantasy*.
</pre>
                    <p>
                      <font face="Verdana, Lucida Sans, Arial" size="-1">Unless, of course, we have a technological ceiling up ahead, which would derail this argument, at least insofar as the technology issue is concerned. And if social and economic aspects are tied to technology, as one might argue, well... you can see my point easily enough. In any case, yes, having aliens in a campaign necessitates lots of work, at least if you want to do it well. Is it really worth it in the end? I guess that question can only be answered on an individual basis. My supposition in starting this thread was that it is worth it, or that it's at least worth exploring.</font>
                    <p>
                      <font face="Verdana, Lucida Sans, Arial" size="-1">At this point, however, I think I'll hang back and switch over to another thread, even though there were numerous other responses which I could site (including a rather Malthusian thesis proposed by Bertil that Fermi's question may be solved by the notion of mandatory self-extermination, i.e., that any given race, even a space-faring one, must outstrip its resources and self-destruct as a mathematical inevitability due to the rather mundane fact that spherical volume grows more rapidly than surface area as a sphere of colonization expands in size). I leave you techno- junkies to calculate this out on your pocket TIs.</font>
                    <p>
                      <font face="Verdana, Lucida Sans, Arial" size="-1">Now, as to that other topic I promised... ah yes... here it is. World Building.</font>
                    <p>
                      <font face="Verdana, Lucida Sans, Arial" size="-1">Ahem. This could take some time.</font>
                    <p>
                      <font face="Verdana, Lucida Sans, Arial" size="-1">In my follow-up article of Nov 9, I proposed a fairly generic classification scheme which, me being a humanities major (that is my perennial excuse, by the way), I felt was just vague enough to be useful. It went something like this:</font>
                    <ul>
                      <li><font face="Verdana, Lucida Sans, Arial" size="-1">Solar Companion: Not technically a world but not the main star or even a part of the close-binary pair.</font>
                      <li><font face="Verdana, Lucida Sans, Arial" size="-1">Gas Giant: Fairly obvious. Great for wilderness refueling if we're using hydrogen to get around.</font>
                      <li><font face="Verdana, Lucida Sans, Arial" size="-1">Greenhouse: A world gone to hell because of too much greenhouse gases.</font>
                      <li><font face="Verdana, Lucida Sans, Arial" size="-1">Planetoid: A very small world, generally. Not necessarily round. No atmosphere to speak of. Composed of rock or ice.</font>
                      <li><font face="Verdana, Lucida Sans, Arial" size="-1">Belch Ball: You don't want to breath the atmosphere. Probably corrosive in the extreme.</font>
                      <li><font face="Verdana, Lucida Sans, Arial" size="-1">Primordial: A very young world. Atmosphere varies.</font>
                      <li><font face="Verdana, Lucida Sans, Arial" size="-1">Geologically instable. Lots of volcanos and magma seas.</font>
                      <li><font face="Verdana, Lucida Sans, Arial" size="-1">Desert World: Breathable atmosphere (at least with filter or compressor) but no water that isn't tied up as ice crystals in the soil.</font>
                      <li><font face="Verdana, Lucida Sans, Arial" size="-1">Exotic: Not an atmosphere you want to breath, maybe because it contains poisonous gasses or even lethal micro-organisms. But not a place you can't otherwise walk around, so long as you have your own oxygen supply. Note that an alien ecosystem may well be thriving.</font>
                      <li><font face="Verdana, Lucida Sans, Arial" size="-1">Magma Ball: Ouch, this place is hot.</font>
                      <li><font face="Verdana, Lucida Sans, Arial" size="-1">Vacuum Ball: Like the moon, essentially. Lots of rock. No atmosphere.</font>
                      <li><font face="Verdana, Lucida Sans, Arial" size="-1">Shallow World: Has atmosphere but not enough to breath, at least not without descending to a very deep altitude. Mars could be an example.</font>
                      <li><font face="Verdana, Lucida Sans, Arial" size="-1">Dead World: The place is certainly colonizable, but for one reason or another, life either never existed or went extinct long ago. Maybe its an ice-world. Or maybe it's a near desert. Maybe the sun flared and knocked out the entire ecosystem. Or maybe a slew of meteors struck, churning up enough dust that the sun was blotted out for decades.</font>
                      <li><font face="Verdana, Lucida Sans, Arial" size="-1">Garden World: Earth is a prime example. Not only can you breath the atmosphere without mechanical aid, but life, either native or transplanted, thrives in abundance.</font>
                      <li><font face="Verdana, Lucida Sans, Arial" size="-1">Water World: Over 90% covered by water and ice. Possibly a breathable atmosphere. Possibly a teaming native ecosystem which got evolutionarily stuck due to the total lack of any freestanding continents.</font>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                      <font face="Verdana, Lucida Sans, Arial" size="-1">I didn't get quite as many comments on this puppy, but I was surprised to see that one reader did catch me red-handed in the act of plagiarism... er... I mean research. Right! That's it. Research! :-)</font>
                    <p>
                      <font face="Verdana, Lucida Sans, Arial" size="-1">Mitch Gold, (if memory serves) the former moderator for rec.games.frp.archives, sent me a copy of the following planetary classification scheme which was posted to rec.games.frp many eons ago and which bears a suspicious similarity to the one I posted on Nov 9.</font><br>

                      <font face="Verdana, Lucida Sans, Arial" size="-1">In fact, this table was originally printed (to the best of my knowledge) in a book entitled <i>Worlds of the Federation</i> by Shane Johnson. I chose this table as a basis for what I was doing, not so much because I like the trek classification system, but because I always feel this strange compulsion to base my work on *something*, and this table happened to be sitting in front of my when the compulsion hit me. In any case, my perversions of this table were never approved by Paramount. :-)</font>
                      <p>
                        <font face="Verdana, Lucida Sans, Arial" size="-1">As for comments on the scheme, Bertil suggested looking into 2300AD. I did, briefly, and I have more to say about that later. Anders, meanwhile, noted that while broad classification can be useful, it's important to recognize that each planet is unique, and hence, one must not overlook the details. And speaking of details, Nick Janow took me up on my explanation of &quot;Desert World&quot;.</font><br>

&gt;&gt; Desert World: Breathable atmosphere (at least with filter or
&gt;&gt; compressor) but no water that isn't tied up as ice crystals in
&gt;&gt; the soil.
&gt;
&gt;Ummm, if there's no liquid water available to support life,
&gt;what's generating the oxygen in the atmosphere?

                        <font face="Verdana, Lucida Sans, Arial" size="-1">Now this is just the sort of thing a dorky humanities major would foul-up. Oops.</font>

                        <font face="Verdana, Lucida Sans, Arial" size="-1">After years of watching Captain Kirk traipse around dead worlds without so much as a filter mask, after watching Luke moan about his lot in life on that desert world he grew up on, well... I guess I just got taken in.</font>
                      <p>
                        <font face="Verdana, Lucida Sans, Arial" size="-1">Never mind about technological inconsistencies. Never mind about Fermi's Question. Let's just talk about some simple chemistry. The majority of popular SF is literally drowning in these sort of inconsistencies, and because the majority of the audience is scantily educated in such matters, they get away with it time and time again.</font>
                      <p>
                        <font face="Verdana, Lucida Sans, Arial" size="-1">The problem is so pervasive that even our popular SF-RPGs have succumbed. Traveller, arguably the most popular SF-RPG, uses in its basic planetary profile system a classification scheme for atmospheres which focuses primarily on density, not composition. When they finally got around the handling atmospheric composition in the World Builder's Handbook (this being produced by DGP, not GDW), they came up with the following atmospheric taints: disease, gas mix, high oxygen, low oxygen, pollutants, sulfur compounds. That's it. Honest. That's the whole damn list. Well, okay, I think &quot;radiation&quot; was mentioned on a separate chart, but even including that, we're talking seven taints. Think about it. This book was entitled &quot;World Builder's Handbook&quot;. Atmosphere is arguably the most important component of a world. &quot;So like, Jim, can we like breath on this world or what?&quot; And this is what they came up with. Okay, I'll stop ranting. No need for a tranquilizer. Really, I'm okay. :-)</font>
                      <p>
                        <font face="Verdana, Lucida Sans, Arial" size="-1">SJG goes into slightly more detail. For atmospheric composition we've got: Reducing (Methane, CO2, and/or Hydrogen), Oxygen- Nitrogen (with only the most vaguely established percentage ranges), Polluted (pollen, ash, industrial pollutants, etc), Exotic (hydrogen, methane, carbon oxides, nitrogen), Corrosive (ammonia, chlorine, fluorine, high-oxygen, nitrides, sulfur compounds, and water vapor). However, this detail is never really fleshed out. What are the peculiarities of such atmospheric compositions. Under what conditions are you likely to find them. Do you really need life in order to sustain free-standing oxygen in an atmosphere? Which gases are incompatible? In short, give me a process to follow.</font>
                      <p>
                        <font face="Verdana, Lucida Sans, Arial" size="-1">To give SJG the credit they deserve, they touch on a lot of these issues, and they make a good attempt at formalizing it all with a process, but I still get the feeling that if what we're looking for is Hard-SF, detail-oriented, chemical mucky-mucking, we can go even further (and yes, we can *always* go further).</font>
                      <p>
                        <font face="Verdana, Lucida Sans, Arial" size="-1">I decided to take Bertil's advice and take a look at 2300AD. This time, GDW provides us with a list of gasses along with their molecular weights, but no means to determine the percentages of dominance. Here's the list, by the way.</font><br>
                      <p>
                        &nbsp;

                        <font face="Verdana, Lucida Sans, Arial" size="-1">The basic idea is that you figure out your planetary diameter and density, and from that you can figure out the minimum molecular weight retained. Then you consult this little table, and you can figure out which gasses have bled off into space. For Earth, I guess, that would be Hydrogen and Helium.</font>
                      <p>
                        <font face="Verdana, Lucida Sans, Arial" size="-1">2300AD does give rules for determining oxygen content, but they are pretty much based on the world's hydrosphere. The presence or absence of life never figures into the equation. Likewise, there are no rules for determining the preponderance of other gasses. Nor are there rules to determine what effects these other gasses might have, if any.</font>
                      <p>
                        <font face="Verdana, Lucida Sans, Arial" size="-1">Looking toward net publications with my last lingering strands of hope, I found that even Ross Smith's <i>Planet Generation System</i> which was posted over a year ago makes no attempt to determine atmospheric gasses. Indeed, taking together the sum of these four separate systems, there seems to be a strong argument issuing forth that such details are unnecessary, even cumbersome.</font>
                        <p>
                          <font face="Verdana, Lucida Sans, Arial" size="-1">I think, going back to my original question of Oct 26, that this was at least part of the sort of question I was getting at. I mean, in Soft-SF, not only do we see lots of violation of various rules of chemistry as the setting plays a subservient role to the story, but we also see a real disregard for the details of setting in general. I don't mean &quot;disregard&quot; in a negative sense. All I'm saying is that such details are viewed as trivial... as entirely irrelevant and beneath consideration and perhaps even a bit dangerous (after all, the less you say, the less there is to foul up on).</font>
                        <p>
                          <font face="Verdana, Lucida Sans, Arial" size="-1">Consider, Classic Traveller used a single digit to represent a planet's atmosphere, and they got away with it for an awful long time. I heard people on the TML (the Traveller Mailing List if you need some help with this acronym) complain about all sorts of things, but the issue of atmospheric composition wasn't a memorable part of the discussion. My guess is that while many SF gamers would like to think of themselves as enjoying &quot;Hard-SF&quot; over &quot;Soft-SF&quot;, most don't want to be concerned with such mundane matters as a planet's atmosphere. Far more fun to just &quot;wing it&quot;, even if there are freeware programs to generate and record such minutia.</font>
                        <p>
                          <font face="Verdana, Lucida Sans, Arial" size="-1">I remember a long discussion we had on the TML back in February of '93 regarding main world generation. I still have a copy of the discussion, in fact, which is why I'm able to remember the date. But the reason I bring it up is because Bruce Pihlamae said something conspicuously noteworthy. He said, instead of looking at mainworld generation or even at star system generation as a frozen process, that is, as a process which you undertake without any regard to the age of the star or the age of the planets, how about instead looking at it as an evolutionary process.</font>
                        <p>
                          <font face="Verdana, Lucida Sans, Arial" size="-1">For those of you who have generated characters in Traveller, you probably know what I'm talking about. You don't just roll attributes and pick skills as in many other games. You undertake a career. You make choices in that career. And as you go through this process, not only do you generate a character, but you also generate the character's career history. How appropriate it is, then, to transfer this concept over to star system generation. Start with a cloud of dust breaking off from some stellar nursery and take it through an iterative process. Time consuming if done manually, but a computer could do it quickly and perhaps even generate results which make more sense than the results from a frozen process. Why, they'd have to make sense, because they wouldn't be just random die rolls. They'd be part of a world's geologic history, and the process would make sure they fit into that history.</font>
                        <p>
                          <font face="Verdana, Lucida Sans, Arial" size="-1">Well, as you can see, this whole issue of planetary generation can get somewhat cloudy. Here I've managed to ramble on about planetary atmosphere for God only knows how long, and yet there are so many other factors to consider, and the difficult part is that they're all interrelated. And so instead of scooting on ahead into yet more mundane and possibly mind-boggling matters of world generation, I'm going to return to a subset of my original question of Oct 26. In short, do you as a gamer (either player or gamemaster) prefer to deal with this stuff, or do you prefer to just ignore it? And how you answer that question, I think, says a bit about what sort of gamer you are. I personally can go either way. I find most of my players don't give a rat's hindquarters, however, and I really don't blame them. But your groups may be different, and whichever the case, I'd like to hear about it.</font><br>
