AB: Despite large differences in limb configuration, the energetic cost of running in cheetahs, gazelles and goats of about the same mass was nearly identical over a wide range of speeds. Also, the observed energetic cost of running was almost the same as that predicted on the basis of bodyweight: in ml oxygen/g km the observed rates were for cheetah 0.14, for gazelle 0.16 and for goat 0.18. The linear correlations between oxygen consumption and speed were 0.93, 0.94 and 0.95. The constancy of values despite the differences in limb mass and distribution of mass along the limb suggests that most of the energy spent on running at constant speed is not used to accelerate and decelerate the limbs.

AB: Cheetahs sprint at speeds exceeding 100 km/h. At this speed their calculated heat production would be more than 60 times that at rest. The cheetah stores most of the heat produced while running: 70% of the heat produced during a 15-min run at 11 km/h was stored; this increased to 90% at 18 km/h. The cheetah refused to run when rectal temperature reached 40.5 deg C. Thus, the distance at which a cheetah pursues its prey appears to be limited by the rise in its body temperature. The resting cheetah possesses substantial capability for dissipating heat evaporatively and can maintain a constant body temperature of about 40 deg when air temperature is 50 deg . During running these evaporative heat-loss mechanisms are not activated. By comparison, the goat, a non-sprinter, increased evaporation and stored much less heat while running than the cheetah.
