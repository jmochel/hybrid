AB: Building on the work of Zimring, Vinson, and Sarvesvaran and Jayewardene, findings are presented on the weapon (or instrumentality) effect in homicidal violence. Data on weapons, wounds, and emergency medical response times were collected in St. Louis for 248 victims of severe assaults and homocides. Analysis confirms that firearms are more lethal than knives, and that large-caliber hand-guns are more lethal than small-caliber weapons. However, the data also show complex interactions among weapons and wounds, and suggest that many fatalities can be avoided, especially in assaults with knives, if medical authorities are notified quickly and if ambulance crews convey victims to experienced trauma centers within 20 minutes of dispatch.

TI: Indications for operation in abdominal stab wounds: A prospective study of 651 patients

AB: This prospective study comprises 651 patients with knife wounds of the anterior abdomen. Three hundred and forty-five patients (53%) had symptoms of an acute abdomen on admission and were operated on immediately. The remaining 306 patients (47%) were managed conservatively with serial clinical examinations. This group included 26 patients with omental or intestinal evisceration, 18 patients with air under the diaphragm, 12 patients with blood found on abdominal paracentesis, and 18 patients with shock on admission. Only 11 patients (3.6%) needed subsequent operation, and there was no mortality. The overall incidence of unnecessary laparotomies was 5% (completely negative, 3%). Of the 467 patients with proven peritoneal penetration, 27.6% had no significant intra-abdominal injury. It is concluded that many abdominal stab wounds can safely be managed without operation. The decision to operate or observe can be made exclusively on clinical criteria. Peritoneal penetration, air under the diaphragm, evisceration of omentum or bowel, blood found on abdominal paracentesis, and shock on admission are not absolute indications for surgery. Alcohol consumption by the patient does not interfere with the clinical assessment.

TI: Patterns in sharp force fatalities - a comprehensive forensic medical study

AB: A ten-year series of 142 homicidal fatalities caused by sharp force injury was studied with the aim to systematize information inherent in the characteristics of the victim and the pattern of injuries. The population of victims consisted of 112 males (79%) and 30 females (21%); among perpetrators, 125 (88%) were males. Among victims as well as among perpetrators, persons of non-Swedish origin were overrepresented in relation to their share of the nonselected population. In 82 cases (58%), one or two wounds had been inflicted; in 23 cases (16%), ten or more wounds. In the latter group, eleven victims but no perpetrators were female. In the majority of cases victim and perpetrator were known to each other, and in instances of multiple wounding, a close relationship between the two was clearly more common than in the group of one to two-wound fatalities. Tests for blood alcohol were positive in 86 of 116 victims (74%), the majority being in elimination phase. Furthermore, 96 of 120 perpetrators (80%) had positive tests or were known to be drunk at the time of the killing. In mulitple wound fatalities, alcohol inebriation was less common both among victims and perpetrators. In these cases, the two persons involved were usually closely related or intimately known to each other, and in the absence of psychiatric disorder in the assailant, the motive was of a passionate type.

AB: Conflicting data exist concerning the value of antimicobial prophylaxis in chest trauma. In a prospective and randomized study, we assessed the value of antibiotic prophylaxis in 80 consecutive relatively young, predominantly male patients admitted for gunshot or knife injuries of the chest. Forty patients received intravenous doxycycline and 40 received no antibiotic. Between the two groups we found no difference in the incidence of postoperative infections: we conclude that routine antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended in penetrating chest trauma in patients such as ours.
