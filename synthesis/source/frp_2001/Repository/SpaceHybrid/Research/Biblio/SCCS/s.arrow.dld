AB: Arrow injuries sustained during tribal fighting are a common reason for admission to the hospitals of Southern Highlands Province in Papua New Guinea (P.N.G.). The authors, Canadian and American family physicians with an aggregate 12 years' general practice experience in the P.N.G. Highlands, present the findings of a 1-year retrospective study of arrow wound victims admitted to two hospitals. Arrow wound injuries are a consequence of a variety of sociocultural factors that continue to result in their high incidence despite many decades of contact with the outside world. We present the details of the presentation and management of 90 cases including a preponderence of soft-tissue as well as intracranial, thoracic, and abdominal injuries. Illustrative case histories of the more challenging or unusal cases provide insight into the unique opportunity afforded the general practitioner/surgeon in managing a type of injury which has become virually extinct in North American practice over the last 200 years.

AB: Two instances of fatal arrow wounds are described, one by a field-tip (target arrowhead), the other by a broadhead (large-game hunting arrowhead). The essential characteristics of the two types of wounds are discussed. In particular, the field-tip can closely simulate a bullet wound by causing a circular entrance hole with abraded margins, whereas the broadhead can create unusual radiating incised wounds.

AB: Arrow wounds represent an unusual class of wounds rarely seen by most death investigators. Although the edged, broadhead-tipped arrow produces a wound usually characteristic of archery/crossbow weapons, the plain, field-tipped arrow wound can be confused with gunshot injuries in those cases in which power residue or firearm projectiles or fragments or both are not recovered. We present a case of a deer carcass with a wound of uncertain firearm or archery origin which initiated a comparison of firearm wounds and archery wounds on fresh road-killed deer. We found the following features to be valuable in the differentiation of gunshot wounds and field-tipped archery wounds: First, the majority of the gunshot wounds (but none of the arrow wounds) had identifiable, macroscopic, wipe-off material and chemically identifiable wipe-off residue by spot test. Second, the archery wound defects had very inconspicuous abrasion rings as compared to the often prominent abrasion rings of gunshot wounds. Third, the actual central defect in the archery wounds was more likely to be oblong or slit-like compared to the gunshot wound defects, which were more likely to be round.

AB: Wooden tipped arrows are still used in tribal fighting in the Highlands of Papua New Guinea. Thirteen cases of arrow injury to the heart and mediastinum, presenting at Mt. Hagen Hospital in a 2-year period, are described. Ten cases presented early (within 3 days) while the remaining 3 cases presented late and suffered from mediastinal abscesses. Removal of the arrow, after full visualization with repair where possible, was performed in all cases with two deaths and little morbidity. Most of the 13 patients arrived in a stable condition, withstood surgery well and made a rapid recovery (average stay in hospital 20 days). Unstable presentations included 2 cases of mild shock, one with early cardiac tamponade and one case of acute aortic incompetence. Survival figures justify attempted salvage of these patients, even with the limited facilities available.

AB: A patient survived thoracoabdominal penetrating injury with impalement of the descending thoracic aorta from a crossbow bolt. The precise extent and nature of the injury were determined preoperatively by computed tomography. The injury to the aorta had not been suspected clinically before the computed tomographic scan.
