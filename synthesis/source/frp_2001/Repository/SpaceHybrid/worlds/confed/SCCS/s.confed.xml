    <title>The History of the Confederation</title>
    <chapter>
        <title>Brief Description</title>
        <para>
        The Confederation of Systems, more commonly known as the 
        Confederation or Confed, is a collection of solar systems and colonies banded 
        together for both defense and trade. There has been a concerted 
        effort by the Confed to limit interference in the internal workings of the 
        actual systems.
        </para>
        <para>
        The Confed emcompasses a number of major racial groups. The Terrans 
        and the various derivative races of {\it Homo Terra Prime} 
        constitute a major portion of the current population. The Alpha 
        Centaurans and the derivative races of {\it Homo Alpha Centauran 
        Prime} constitute the next largest group followed closely by the 
        Proximans {\it Homo Proxima Prime}. There are no other known races 
        currently members of the Confed.
        </para>
        <para>
        The duties of the Confederation as a governing body are quite simple: 
        keep the peace {\em Between member systems}. To this end each system 
        donates a portion of its military services to the Confed as well as 
        some monetary support.

                <para>
                The history of the Confederation is most properly the history of the 
                Terrans. The Terrans were one of the primary forces behind the 
                formation of the Confederation. 

                The Terran History of the years immediately preceeding the year 2560 is
                found to have a nearly hysterical flavour to those used to reading the
                histories of less divided cultures. Most other cultures in the 
                Confederation of Systems have a sharply defined predilection toward or
                away from war. Few cultures have the ambivalence of a Terran towards
                violence.

                During the time period following the Second World War the world focused
                in conflicts around the two main super powers of the time period. With
                a strong technological lead over the Soviet Bloc, the USA spent a great
                deal of energy and influence in combatting any gains made by the Soviet
                Bloc.

        During this time period there was a gradual decline in the health of
        the economies of the two Blocs as well as in actual scientific rather
        than technological knowledge growth. In addition there was a marked
        increase in religous fundamentalism in both the US and abroad in
        various Islamic and Hindu countries. Both of the superpowers of the 
        time period tended to ignore the economic build up of other countries 
        except when their own immediate well being seem threatened. Certainly 
        , both countries had a great deal to worry about.

        The stresses placed on some of the smaller countries by the three ``super powers''

        sthe Indos Island States (Phillipines and Indonesia), and the loosley allied 
        Scandinavian Coalition (the Scandic).

        supporters. in doing so they establish a fairly strong tradition for 
        the U.N. as a military force and the use of Israeli Officers as advisors.
