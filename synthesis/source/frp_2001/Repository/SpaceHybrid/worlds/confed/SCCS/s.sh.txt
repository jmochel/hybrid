Subject:	SH: Mechanics of psi

     I have not yet received answers to some general questions about this 
     gaming system.  I am interested in working inside of the design of the 
     system to the extent possible, however, my ability to plan ahead and 
     to prepare for play is hindered by my ignorance of the mechanics of 
     psi.  
     
     I do not wish to disrupt the play with a) moves which are outside the 
     boundaries of play, or b) moves which are questionable given the 
     parameters of the system.  Therefore, I seek clarification before I 
     just start making shit up.  
     
     
     I. General
     
     - You say that psionics are described and teated in a manner similar 
     to Thrown Weapons.  I am unfamiliar with the nuts and bolts of that 
     system (or should I say slings and arrows?).  Where can I find a 
     summary to read?  
     
     - What is the effect of concentration aids?  How much do they add?  
     
     - Can concentration aids include 'crystal balls' or other magically 
     sensitized objects?  
     
     - Is the effect increased by cooperation with others working on the 
     same subject?  Need they be aware of each other to be able to add to 
     the process?  Or is it not additive at all?  
     
     - Is there the possibility for a psionic 'familiar', avatar, or 
     sorcerer's-apprentice-type?  I would imagine that they could either 
     improve concentration or off-load a significant part of the work.  
     
     - How long must one concentrate to perform (typical range)?  How long 
     is one diabled after working psi?  Is one physically drained as well, 
     or just mentally drained?   
     
     - Is psi performed only with humans?  with mammals?  with animals?  
     with living things?  Where on the scale is the effect on aliens?  
     
     
     II. Foreseeing/Precognition
     
     - Does distance (in terms of time) make a difference?  In other words, 
     are 'sooner' things easier to see, or, when you see something, is it 
     difficult to tell whether it's in the next two minutes or the next two 
     centuries?  
     
     - Does distance (in terms of space) make a difference?  In other 
     words, can you see future things in far away spaces as easily as where 
     you are currently standing?  
     
     - Does one get clear images or vague impressions?  Or does this vary 
     by person or by training/experience?  
     
     - Is this primarily a visual sensing?  Or does one experience future 
     sounds and smells?  
     
     - What is clairsentience?
     
     
     II. Telepathy
     
     - In the general description, telepathy is described as the use of the 
     mind to affect others (an active force).  Under skills you list 
     perception, empathy, surface read, etc. (all passive).  Is a 
     telepathic able to change minds, or just read them?
     
     - What is Surface Read, and how does it differ from empathy?  
     
     - Does distance (in terms of space) make a difference?  In other 
     words, is there more effect with greater proximity?  What is the 
     effective range?  Can telepathy span star systems?  
     
     - Does prior relationship (in terms of knowing the other) make a 
     difference?  In other words, is there more effect with someone you 
     know well, or does it work just as well with aliens?  
     
     - At what level is communication understood?  Do telepaths hear 
     thoughts, entire sentences, or just moods?  
     
     
     IV. Stealth/Deception (Psionic)
     
     - Does stealth mask who is working?  In other words, can one work psi 
     anonymously?  
     
     - Does stealth mask what is being done?  In other words, can one work 
     psi unnoticed (even though it is clear who is working psi)?  
     
     - Must one choose whether to mask who or what?  
     
     - Does deception mask/redirect who is working?  In other words, does 
     it appear as though someone else is working psi?  
     
     - Does deception mask/redirect what is being done?  In other words, 
     can working energetics appear as (or read as) something else, say, 
     telekinesis?  
     
     
     These are admittedly basic, fundamental questions.  I am humbled that 
     I do not already know the answers to them, and would be graciously 
     appreciative of any response you might have the time or space to give. 
      Perhaps if you have other pressing matters, you could delegate some 
     underling to attend to my tutelege.  
     
     I apologize a thousand thousand times for disturbing your eminent 
     repose.  
     
     With all good wishes,

My experience is as follows:
	I know a little french.  I learned it all by reading.  I cannot pronounce it for beans and no one can
	understand what I say.  I can understand what other people say (as well as I can read which is
	poorly).
	I know a little greek.  It took me less than a day to get to the point where I can read greek letters
	and turn them into greek sounds better than Andrea can.  She however actually knows what the
	words mean and can pronounce the ones she recognizes better. I can pronounce the ones she
	does not recognize better than her but I don't know what they mean.  I can also read faster than 
	her but with the same limitation.  Most of the greek I know I learned from speaking.  I can write
	this spoken stuff but it has that same phonetic problem that english has.  Other people can read
	and understand it but it is often not correct.
	I used to know the russian alphabet but now I cannot even pronounce it.
	I know some japanese words but I do not know any of the alphabets.
	Alphabets are very different than ideograms and should probably have different languages.

I suggest the following model:
	Writing is a light-weight filter skill to a language.  The inaccurate but playable model would be
	that people learn spoken languages (even from reading) and the writing skill is merely an 
	enabler that allows them to decipher the phonemes they are used to hearing as encoded in
	an arbitrary symbol set.  I would call it a light-weight filter in that each rank would enable three
	or four ranks in the language.  This is to model the fact that I think a 26 letter alphabet is pretty
	trivial to learn.  I would also suggest that the skill be for an alphabet rather than a language.  I
	can read english written in greek letters and greek written in roman letters.  I would also suggest
	that an ideogram based writing skill be treated as a full language because the vocabulary of symbols
	is as large as the vocabulary of the language.  What do you think?

Would Terran Culture be a secondary (2%/rank) for a roll in N.A. Culture?

Incorrect.  Pook is right on here.  The RUNE skill is the skill of knowing the various runes and how to scribe them.  To understand a
treatiuse written in ancient Faer-han you need to know L:Ancient Faerhan.

I agree that r/w is a seperate skill.. I also agree about the lower cost.

Subject:	Morning Gaming Rants

Well Jim, Now you get to be subjected to what I was subjecting Alex to the last few weeks before the ritual.
Morning raves about your gaming system.  Today's topics are as follows:

1.	It is a bitch being a scientist.  I knew this from the last rev of the system and it is not a complaint.
It is merely an observation after looking at the experience point system.

2.	I happen to notice in the skills chapter a mention of R/W skills for a language.  I do not think we should
	have separate R/W skills.  The assumption that they make is that it is half the effort to learn a language
	in spoken form than in spoken and R/W form.  In my experience there is a skill in the language which
	takes 80% of the effort to learn and then there are filter skills in alphabet recognition and pronunciation.
	Both of these skills are trivial to learn compared to the grammar and vocabulary and are of no
	importance beyond a rudimentary level to 99% of the population.

	I have no problem with the separation of spoken and R/W languages in BT but I believe that this is
	completely different for two reasons: 

	The written skills are in an alphabet rather than a language, hence you could write any number 
of languages in Tarek runes and knowing Tarek runes by themselves would allow you to read 
none of them, you would need the language skill as well as the rune skill (I assume this is true).

Shapeshifters occurs in a culture where literacy is less than 10%.  I forget how BT works for 
Dangerous Jazz.  Space Hybrid occurs in a culture where (I am assuming) literacy is 99%.

I would be much happier if we eliminated R/W skills for language and said that the single language
skill covered both.  What do you think?

3.	Can I get the formula for the eps table so I can generate it myself in excell.

4.	I am planning on taking skills which overlap quite a bit.  An example of this 
	would be:
	Terran Culture (2000)
	N. American Culture (2000)
	Canadian Culture (2000)
	How should I calculate my success chance for this triad specifically.

Version I of the Beltane Character Sheet

This is post careers, pre-experience.

I need experience points for all the adventuring we had done (basically
this should be almost identical to the amount you gave Karban I think).

I need an experience point spending system.

I plan to reconcile my character generation with my history again and 
fill in more details.

What is the reputation pool and how do I express it in the final character.
I divided my reputation into a number of areas.  Academic reputation,
Underworld reputation, Mass-Media reputation and literary reputation
(I am going to merge the last into Mass-Media reputatiuon).  Each of
these has a rep value from 3 (Underworld) to 6 (Academia).  What do
these mean?  What is a big rep?  If 6 is not that big I will spend more
eps/personal points to bump it.  How would I do that?

No.  Processing of visual information for real-world information is an 
inexact and demanding science when the environment is cluttered and the 
objects are flexible in form.  While quite suitable for ship-recognition, 
and helpful in the friend-or-foe routines in your suit processors, the 
analysis you are proposing would require a special-purpose semi-AI, and a 
noticeable portion of the ship's processing power.  Probable false alarms 
would be frequent, and missed alarm situations would be probable enough 
for me not to guarantee my work.

I could set up a sealed-archive recording system, if you like.   I would 
recommend a similar system for sleeping areas and lavatories, where 
people might wish some illusion of privacy, rather than a live-viewing 
option.

Simple and straightforward, though you might do better simply assigning 
the primary responsibility and letting the individuals concerned work out 
shift details and such, allowing them the flexibility to use their 
abilities and individual talents to maximum efficiency.

I am not sure this level of detail is an effective use of your abilities. 
 I have several times observed evolved systems behave better than imposed 
ones, particularly when large numbers of disparate individuals are 
evolved.  I would suggest concentrating your attention on the desired 
results and expected level of behavior, letting the people concerned have 
more at stake in the process would a similar number of mindless 
automatons.  Humans (and related species) do very poorly as 
hive-creatures.

Have you considered reviewing a course or two on management techniques?  
They might come in helpful in the next few years.

I will certainly go over the cultural interactions with you.  The background
material is not a problem.  Just to round out the details it would be
useful to interview Nahabidian on the subject just to cover any details
which get glossed over in the written material.  I also don't mind helping
to present to the humans if you would like that.  Also, it would be 
appropriate to include (to a smaller extent) some discussion of alphan
culture to both groups and some discussion of the sub-cultures within
human culture (Wyccan/Calvanist/god I am blanking on the name of
your culture/...) since I'll bet that half of the humans on board are not
Terran.  I will put all of this material together for you.  If you don't mind
I will also include Ambassador in the process of putting the information
together (I will translate anything he says into comprehendable
language) since I think it would be polite and he probably has some
excellent insight.  I will also touch base with Stillmist on the subject.

Does that sound good?

Subject:	Re: Karban's Schedule

     What?  No nookie for Karban?  And cold showers twice a day?  
     For a mission that spans years, methinks Karban has some need of a 
     main squeeze.  
     
     Perhaps this might have something to do with her outrage over the 
     Proximan pleasure crew?

Got that- I and Stillmist would co-lead both sessions with Brox.  I want a UNIFIED presence on the stage.  (By
the way Karban is not coming up with this stuff- she is
probably copying this whole thing out of a white paper Lesk wrote and with Beltane's coaching....)

BEFORE THE RUN:
GET EEPS for my thirteen or so runs.
Get the eeps system or-ist just like the Player's Guide says?
I need to what mods are for training under Captain Portlin in the
    Strategic Services Strategic Package and Command Package.
I need to know what mods are for training under

DURING THE RUN:
Talk and get related to Captain Sharona- enroll her in training me
Join her training under First Officer Gisime in SS stuff.
Set up and implement first war games.
Have Lysanndra conversation with Myth
Have a conversation with Elder Gabriel
Meet with Ambassador, Stillmist, and the girls.
Have birds and bees conversation with Lysanndra (should be hilarious!)
Have the "fair " the Ambassador is planning
Have the first PRAC meeting (I have an idea about that Jim- let's
literaly
    clock it in game time and have it last not more than an hour!)
However
    the first one will be very amusing since everyone will be together
and
     everyone's pre-conceptions will crop up.

That is it- I am up for all role-playing though action would be cool I
recognize
it is early yet!

Please tell me what you can send me about eeps!

Subject:	SH: Mission Order Reminders and Updates

DATE: 08/08/55

Here is a copy of the orders I sent this afternoon:

Camelot Ship-Board Order 1:

I am assigning the following MI to be responsible for the protection of
their client.

Each of you will be assigned a Hand of the Proximan Marauders- the
T'kan- to support you in this.  Dagger Brox will assign the hand to you.

Your assignments will be in your mailboxes by this afternoon.

You must keep two guards on each of your clients at any one time.
Any guard you assign must be FULLY briefed on ship defense plans,
boarding evasion plans, evacuation, emergency exit routes, and escape
pod locations.   They need to be cleared by me and they must be clear
that their life is non-essential compared to their client.  The client
must live at ALL costs- even against the clients wishes if necessary.
No guard should stay on full alert longer than three hours.  You must be

with the client a minimum of one watch per day- I want you all
intimately familiar with your client.

Trooper "Alan"  -  Your assignment is to guard the Alphan Ambassador.
Trooper Hughes - Your assignment is to guard Counselor 12
Sergeant Wills    - Your assignment is to guard Elder Gabriel.

If I declare a code 12 your job is to get your client to the starboard
pinnace- which is stocked for long-term space travel, and can run
"silent"- and leave.  Sgt. Wills will be training the other two of you
on
piloting a pinnace in case she is killed or disabled.   Now- I don't
care if you hear anyone- myself included- screaming for help, calling
your names, begging for help- if I have declared a code 12 your job
is to get out.

Is all of that clear?

***
CAMELOT SHIP-BOARD ORDER 3:

To all Military Personnel in Task Force Camelot:

Earlier this morning an order (SHIP-BOARD ORDER 2) was sent
out forbidding fraternization between the MI and the Proximan
troops and women.  I am issuing new fraternization orders now.

These orders supercede and cancel the orders of this morning.

All military personnel will participate in weekly tactical and
strategic games in order to forge acombat relationship between
personnel from different services and backgrounds.

Details of the first war games will be forthcoming.

Sgt. Commander Stillmist will be in charge of Proximan-MI
liaison efforts.  He will arrange for suitable social and military
exchange opportunities.  Any questions can be directed to him.

There will be a mandatory course held tommorow.  All Proximan
troops will attend the 1300 meeting in the main meeting hall.  All
MI and Scouts will attend the 1600 meeting at the main meeting
hall.   Dr. Beltane and Nahabidian Drexel will be speaking to
Proximan-Terran cultural connection, familiarizing us with the
other's cultures and social behaviour and giving us a good start
at mutual respect.  Attendance at these meetings are manadatory
except for those personnel on Class A guard duty at those times.
They will be informed as to how they will recieve the experience.

Any questions please, direct them to Sgt. Cmmdr Stillmist.

End Orders

trip!

Pook:  Will you lead those meetings with Nahibidian?  I know you will
have to cram to do the homework for it but I think you are one of the
best human to do this.

Dave:  I will basically just give Stillmist the order, but Alex wants to

Wasn't sure if the fact that I had no social interaction as a child would
affect my social skills.  I assume that Sociology and Psychology can be
trained, but I didn't know how much.

Subject:	SH: Interlude 2 - The Drop

The Drop - or how I spent my fall from orbit.

It's that first step that kills ya'.  When the drop chute blows you into
space and the elephant sits on your chest.  The... dropping feeling.
When your stomach stays in orbit and your body goes flying away from it
at speeds you don't want ta think about.

Then there's the silence.  After the roar of the drop chute and exiting
the spaceship in a puff of gas, complete silence cut through only with
the soft hum of your suit's airflow and the shell's computer.  Then,
after an eternity of watching the little colored displays tell you where
you are, the whistle begins as you penetrate the ionosphere.

You can at first barely hear through your suit sensors but then it gets
louder and louder as the external shell temp display gets more and more
digits.  Then the damn shaking begins...

At first it is just a mild vibration,  but then it starts to feel like
somebody gave you as a present to a giant kitten.  If that weren't bad
enough- just when you think maybe your lunch wouldn't look so bad on the

inside of your suit- you get the release warning and your insides feel
like they are being pressed through your body as the artificial gravity
field cuts in.  It also gives you that itch in all the places you can't
reach in a suit.

And then the break:   3 seconds of screaming terror as the grav field
cuts off and your safe, little universe (after all - a little shaking
never hurt anybody) blows open into a whirlwind of wind,
counter-measures, chaff, and, usually, artillery fire as the ground
rushes up at you at velocities far faster than man was meant to fall
at.  Then your target drivers come up and little red markers show up all
around you as your targeting server is kind enough to let you know
exactly how deep the lake of shit you are falling into is.   The orange
lines showing enemy fire streams and missiles fill the entire sky above
and below you.

Then you start spewing ammo, rockets, grenades and laser-fire all around
you as you hang suspended in space falling at half the speed of sound.
Hitting the 300 meter mark is almost a relief until the giant's hand of
the decelleration field from your MGG slaps you into next week  And, of
course, being a highly trained professional, you are supposed to keep on
eliminating targets and clearing your LZ as your are stuffed into the
top half of your suit and your suit is doing auto-evasion of incoming
fire..

Landing is a cinch- all you need to do is be alive as your suit rights
itself at nine Gs , and slams into the ground.  Ahhh.. the life of an
MI!

I think you absolutley should do that.  Remember they are NPCs- not
PCs.  We are collaborating on a story here, not living in Jim's story.
Jim has the final say that is all.  So he may edit what yoiu right but
you iwll get a lot faster result by inventing it yourself.  That is how
I created Elysia.  I owuld right stuff amnd every now and then Jim would
say-"Ummm.. that isn't true and here's why"  But 90% of what I created
became dogma. Now this is trickier and he will likely edit a lot more
but  that is fine.Sgt. Commander Moore sent me a post about two
disciplinary actions against troopers not on our trip and a BOMB found
on board!  Jim is working on which of those are real and who they
happened to now, but we will have what he reported show up in some way
even thought the facts are not a match.  Write your conversation with
them.  Send me a copy to- I would love to read it.

Here is my cut.   Some of it comes form my perosnal history, some of it
is form Jim and some of it I just plain made up based on Calvinist s i
have encountered in Jim's world before, and stuf flike that.JIM:  please
correctany glaring misconceptions.
RON: This is Alex's view not Karb's but Alex doesn't always have an
objective view so Jim will correct.Sure:Trocia 12:
is an Elysian Elder.  She becamse First Speaker of Elysia after the
Tri-Culture war. She is a survivor one of the senior people who kept
people alive underground during the Proximan Years on Elysia.  She
resigned as First Speaker in 2236 when the Confederation was born and
became the COuncil Representative for Elysia to the Confed Council(they
are like a group that has the funmctions of the American Presidant the
elite Senators if you will).  She held that post until about six years
ago in 2249 when she retired from the Senate and the Council and
Karban's co-mother Mora 641 replaced her.    She is still considered one
of the most influential people in the Confed governement.  She is
extremely anti-censorship, pro-education, and something of a hawk.  She
has however made quite a repuation out of her powerful dealings with the
Proximans. She has been VERY politically active since her retirement and
some say she is more powerful now than when she was bound by the
position she was in.  IT was a surprise to Karban to find her here.
Karban is also very Happy that she is here.  SHe is not a decrepit
woman.  She is advanced in years but in wonderful shape and still nice
to look at if you care about such things.

I know a lot less  about Elder Gabriel.
He is an elder statesman also retired form the Council.  He was a
religious leader(is a religious leader, Jim?) on his planet Calvin.  He
is quiet but known for being REALLY canny and trashing his opponents
from complete surprise. He is really big on honesty, morality and
bringing criticial thinking to porblems.  He has no time for fools, and
has trouble dealing with incompetance. Ummm....
Calvinists tend to be really reliable but unimaginative, strong but not
so swift:-)  I odn't know much about this guy- this is more impressions
than anything else.  Karb isn't sure what to make of him.  I have a
feeling you don't notice him until after he has convinced you of what
you wnat!  MAybe that is just Karban's paranoia.  But that is who I
owuld send on this mission If I was sutaken!

Jim: comments?

Dear Mr. Ambassador;

Out of curiosity, I ran your last message through a commercially 
available contextualization and parsing program.  On the most basic 
setting, the output was as follows:

RTFM.

Thank you for your most helpful advice, and please be assured that I

     From the Ambassador.
     
     To Ishido-san
     (copies to Dr. Beltane and the scientific community)
     
     Your comments and questions are most appreciated.  Thank you for the 
     honor of your attention to this small diversion.  
     
     To respond to your question about finite contests:  The mathematics at 
     hand in support of the general theory of power dynamics is not yet 
     sufficiently developed to either describe or 'compute' events 
     topographically at the personal level (the level of individual).  The 
     inquiry under debate, and the modeling that accompanies it, is 
     directed at large conversational constructs.  Indeed, most of the 
     explanatory power of the general model G(v,r5,p(r)) becomes meaningful 
     only where v (gross population) is greater than 100,000, and r5 
     (racial archtype) has sufficient differentiation (skewness) at 
     significances of less than one-half of one percent (0.5%).  
     
     Moreover, the particular thrust of the paper being presented is to 
     introduce the calibrating influence of communication proximity where 
     the frame under consideration is very large.  In the same manner, 
     because of the probablility curve inherent in the approximation 
     procedure, reliable peak sequencing can only be approached inside of 
     the waveform distribution of very large systems.  
     
     'Personal' power figured into my response to Dr. Beltane's question 
     only as an access to illuminate the 'power' axiom of Kris'fatan et al. 
     - one of the most popular models of power dynamics in our times.  The 
     description of personal power was designed only to allow for the 
     larger construct of Societal Power to be introduced.  For those 
     scientists unfamiliar with this field of study, it is often useful to 
     first cover the fundamental theorums, axioms, lemmas, and correllaries 
     via analogy.  
     
     There is a large, and somewhat distinct body of literature that dwells 
     in the decription of 'power' at the level of individual.  Most 
     treatments of this kind of are similarly based around the construct of 
     opposition, whereas the work in this arena usually incorporates some 
     idea of goals, considerations, reality-frame, and motivation; as well 
     as both 1) a significant component dealing with the notion of 
     'property', and 2) a correcting influence for personal perception of 
     mortality (near-space temporal boundaries).  
     
     Some knowledge of the topic of 'personal power' is usually included in 
     most systems of education within Alpha, and therefore, there are quite 
     a few general texts 'published' from Alpha available for an overview.  
     Not being familiar with this particular ship's library, it is 
     difficult to say with certaintly exactly what might be accessible - 
     without a download from some Alphan source.  
     
     If you have general questions, or even a particular avenue of study 
     you wish to pursue in the area of 'personal' power, every effort will 
     be made to accommodate your interest.  
     
     Again, thank you for your reply.  
     
     His Excellency

Excuse me, your excellency.  I do not know what you mean.  What issue of
protocol have I stepped over?  Please enlighten me.  Thank you.

     That is, the composition of the group seems rather unfocused
     and haphazard.

Indeed? It is rather carefully worked out but I can understand that
might not be apparent to someone not trained to look for it.  I will go
into more detail below but if you have any questions please feel free to
ask me specific questions.

          Be that as it may, I think that the membership can be
     dealt with as it
          is.  Perhaps the security officers present will be bored
     from time to
          time as we discuss the issues important to the mission,
     but I think
          they will be able to gain from exposure to the
     conversation.


<Karban raises an eyebrow> Well, I agree- likewise the science and
diplomatic teams will, I am sure, will be bored as we discuss events
critical to the misison but they to will learn much.  These meetings do
promise to be a learning experience.

          Certainly, your report to the group of the military
     situation will be
          the first thing on the agenda each day.  I look forward
     to reviewing
          your comments before our first meeting.  When do you
     think those could
          be available?

<a small pause> I am not sure I understand Mr. Ambassador.  The
briefing on military matters during the PRAC meeting will be your
opportunity to "review" that material.  Do you wish me to include you in
more explicit day-to-day military operations?  I had no idea you had an
interest in that!

Also- Sergeant COmmander Moore is likely to make the military report.  I
will be busy overseeing the entire meeting.   Which leads me to address
another issue which I beleive may be a misunderstanding based on
Alphan-Terran differences.  I hold two command positions in this
mission.  One is that I am the commander of all the military forces.
This is obviously clear to you. I am also the Task Force Commander.
That is the position I do not think was clear for you.  This position is
also known as Task Force Coordinator in other settings.

It is my job to oversee all the elements of the mission to see that they
are fulfilled.  As such-I am in charge of the science and research team,
the medical staff, and, in matter relating to our misison I am the
Captain's superior as well.   Now the diplomatic team- Trocia 12, Elder
Gabrial, and yourself- is responsible for the success of making the
alkiance happen.  It is my job to see to it that you all have everything
that you need.  That you are protected, have the information you need,
get where you need to go, etc.

As such I run the PRAC meeting.  And I invite you to come-because your
insight, input, and analysis will  be invaluable to the success of the
mission.  I invite you to participate fully and ask any questions or
give any input you might have.  If you wish to bring up a major issue or
take a large chunk of time in a meeting please don't hesitate to do so,
but if it si possible give me some warning so I can work it into the
agenda.

We will be engaged in a process over these next few years of learning
what works and what doesn't.  I have a great deal of experience working
with multi-cultural, multi-discipline teams and making it work.  I look
forward to learning more of that and of diplomacy from you, Ambassador.
Please see me if you have ANY questions.

          The sound of argon betrays the mineral.

*I apologize for my ignorance but I am not familiar with this
particular turn of phrase... what does it signify?

     Have a nice day, your Excellency.

                 Karban 541, Field Commander, Task Force Camelot,
     CTS-MI

It sounds like a good thing to play out.  It should serve as a nice

Karb look silly (always a goal of mine... )

     Greetings from the Ambassador.
     
     To Dr. Beltane, Group Dynamics and Cultural Anthropology.
     (copies to scientific community/research directors)
     
     We are pleased to learn that you will be able to attend.  As to who 
     else will be there - the entire scientific community aboard ship, as 
     well as the research directors, have all been invited.  Yours was the 
     first reply - so as of now, I do not know who else will be present.  I 
     have left the invitation open-ended, and I hope that if some find out 
     at the last minute that they will be able to plug in, that they will 
     do so.  
     
     Regarding power:  Forgive me, I have assumed that you were aware of 
     the body of work done by Kris'fatan et al.  I am not sure that the 
     ship's library contains original monographs of this inquiry, 
     therefore, just in case, I will briefly outline the approach below.  
     There may be gaps in this precis; if you have further questions, 
     please do not hesitate to contact me.  
     
     Power here is an axiom of finite game theory.  A finite game is played 
     for the purpose of winning.  If a finite game is to be won by someone, 
     it must come to a definitive end.  It will come to an end when someone 
     has won.  We know that someone has won the game when all the players 
     have agreed who among them is the winner.  No other condition than the 
     agreement of the players is absolutely required in determining who has 
     won the game.  
     
     Just as it is essential for a finite game to have a definitive ending, 
     it must also have a precise beginning.  Therefore, we can speak of 
     finite games as having temporal boundaries - to which, of course, all 
     players must agree.  But players must agree to the establishment of 
     spacial and numerical boundaries as well.  That is, the game must be 
     played within a marked area, and with specific players.  
     
     Only one person or team can win a finite game, but the other 
     contestants may well be ranked at the conclusion of play.  
     
     If finite games must be externally bounded by time, space, and number, 
     they must also have internal limitations on what the players can do to 
     and with each other.  To agree on internal limitations is to establish 
     the rules of play.  The rules of a finite game are the contractual 
     terms by which the players can agree who has won.  
     
     What one wins in a finite game is a title.  A title is the 
     acknowledgment of others that one has been the winner of a particular 
     game.  They are for others to notice.  The effectiveness of a title 
     depends on its visibility, its noticeability to others.  
     
     A finite game must always be won with a terminal move, a final act 
     within the boundaries of the game that establishes the winner beyond 
     any possibility of challenge.  A terminal move results, in other 
     words, in the 'death' of the opposing player *as player*.  The winner 
     'kills' the opponent.  The loser is dead in the sense of being 
     incapable of further play.  
     
     Titles, then, point backward in time.  They have their origin in an 
     unrepeatable past.  The mode and content of address and their manner 
     of behavior are recognitions of the areas in which titled persons are 
     no longer in competition.  Therefore, insofar as we recognize their 
     title, we withdraw from any contest with them in those areas.  
     
     The titled are powerful.  Those around them are expected to yield, to 
     withdraw their opposition, and to conform to their will - in the arena 
     in which the title was won.  The exercise of power always presupposes 
     resistance.  Power is never evident until two or more elements are in 
     opposition.  Whichever element can move another is the more powerful.  
     
     The exercise of power also presupposes a closed field and finite units 
     of time.  My power is determined by the amount of resistance I can 
     displace within given spatial and temporal limits.  The establishment 
     of the limits makes it possible to know how powerful I am in relation 
     to others.  Power is always measured in units of comparison.  In fact, 
     it is a term of competition:  How much resistance can I overcome 
     relative to others?  
     
     Power is a concept that belongs only in finite play.  But power is not 
     properly measurable until the game is completed - until the designated 
     period of time has run out.  During the course of play, we cannot yet 
     determine the power of the players, because to the degree that it is 
     genuine play, the outcome is unknown.  To speak meaningfully of a 
     person's power is to speak of what that person has already completed 
     in one or another closed field.  Inasmuch as power is determined by 
     the outcome of a game, one does not win by being powerful; one wins in 
     order to be powerful.  Power is bestowed by an audience after the play 
     is complete.  
     
     In a related discourse:  Politics is the art of the possible, within 
     fixed limits, within societal realities.  Politics is concerned to 
     find out how much freedom is available within the given realities, 
     within Society.  To 'have' a politics is to have a set of rules by 
     which one attempts to reach a desired end.  
     
     Society, here, is understood as the sum of those relations that are 
     under some form of public constraint.  Nevertheless, Society remains 
     entirely within our free choice in quite the same way that finite 
     competition, however strenuous or costly to the player, never prevents 
     the player from walking off the field of play.  Society applies only 
     to those areas of action which are *believed* to be necessary.   
     
     We may also think of Society as a single finite game that includes any 
     number of smaller games within its boundaries.  The power of citizens 
     in a society is determined by their ranking in games that have been 
     played.  The power of a society is determined by its victory over 
     other societies in still larger finite games.  The power *in* a 
     society is guaranteed and enhanced by the power *of* a society.  
     
     To relate the above to the work under consideration:  Since titles are 
     the evidence of power in an existing conversational space, Power can 
     be modeled as n-dimensional geometric spece.  The interface of power 
     structures between groups or societies can be modeled as the 
     intersection of power waves in that space.  
     
     Factors which govern the topographical effect of that intersection 
     have been shown to include:  gross population (the gross size of the 
     conversational space), racial archtype (the given rules or norms of a 
     society), and racial perception (the 'victories' of the society 
     vis-a-vis other societies).  Gross conversational space can be further 
     adjusted by:  1) the cultural rank of its constituents (weighted by 
     investement in current power structure), 2) the degree of 
     pervasiveness (stratification or mixing) of conversational identity, 
     and 3) the weight of topification (the subjects about which the most 
     comments are made).  
     
     To explore any of the above more completely, you may, of course, refer 
     to the bibliography provided in the paper presented.  
     
     I hope and trust that this is of some interest to you.  I look forward 
     to further inquiry and exploration.

Agreed.  I assume it would be as simple as designating certain people as

"protectors" and having the girls always registered as safe in their
presense.
Also haviung people designated as "unsafe" and if the girls are not in
the
prescense of a "protector" an alert would be sent.   All contingent on
Lyssandra agreeing.

Jim:  Brace yourself to play out one of those conversations.  I will
runthat out with you- do you want me to run it out tonight with you or
in fornt of everyone else?  Likely to be a funny one...
Dave: Karban will request that Stillmeist consult with him on this
conversation since Stillmmist comes from a cultre where sex and
reproduction are linked, andf form Lyssandra's culture.

Ummm... technically yes, although Karban wouldn't enforce it at all with
you.This one of Karbna's itchiest areas- she thinks the Proximans are a

                      Finally, Hokey ( my trained trooper wolf ) sniffed

out an active bomb that I did not plant for boarding exercises. This has

Well, yes and no.

1.  Yes I can.  Probably not with the Yojimbo, unless I hook it into 
ships internal sensors and security monitors, but it is technically 
possible.  To be the sort of comprehensice chaperone/bodyguard Karb is 
thinking of, though, would require considerable processing power; 
human-human interactions are notoriously hard to model accurately.

2.  Unless Lysandra requests this, I will not.  She is an intelligent, 
decision-making sentient, and I believe her judgement to be sound.

3.  If you like, a 'panic button' could be built, which would trigger a 
special alarm (mutually agreed upon by Lysandra and Karban) and an 
in-ship locator function.

4.  Am I on this fraternizing-restricted list?  This sort of social 
engineering by executive fiat always worries me.  Expect the usual polite 
Ishido questions.  (All this despite my total non-interest in dating a 
Proximan.  Not that there's anything wrong with that.)

     Yes, about those PRAC meetings.  There seem to be some issues of 
     protocol that may have been stepped over.  That is, the composition of 
     the group seems rather unfocused and haphazard.  
     
     Be that as it may, I think that the membership can be dealt with as it 
     is.  Perhaps the security officers present will be bored from time to 
     time as we discuss the issues important to the mission, but I think 
     they will be able to gain from exposure to the conversation.   
     
     Certainly, your report to the group of the military situation will be 
     the first thing on the agenda each day.  I look forward to reviewing 
     your comments before our first meeting.  When do you think those could 
     be available?

     Instead of 'good sir', we prefer 'Your Excellency'.  
     
     Another categorization [sigh].  Yes, well.  It seems to us that since 
     the prime objective here is first contact, and that the task force 
     merely ensures the safety of the first contact team, that an 
     appropriate way to categorize the personnel would be as follows:
     
     Contact Team Leadership
     (Trocia 12, Elder Gabriel, Dr. Beltane, Ambassador)
     
     Contact Team Scientific Support
     (Barry, Markolnikhov, Canoff, Connolly, Brosceau, Ishido, IaJimbo)
     
     Contact Team Life Support
     (Dr. Monroe, Dr. Connolly, Nurse Chapel)
     
     Others:
     Vessel Support (Capt. Sharona, Gisime', Drexel, MacPherson)
     Security and Security Support (Karban541, Brox'inar)
     Chronicler (Manning)
     
     By the way, unless you intend a very obscure pun, 'Esper Core' should 
     probably be spelled 'Esper Corps'.

Subject:	Mission Summary addendum (encrypted)

     Jim -
     
     Although Alex did a good job of describing and defining the Mission 
     Summary and personnel complement, his vision is limited here by his 
     Terran perspective.  
     
     Although from a Terran standpoint the mission may be bounded by 'Task 
     force Camelot' within 'Operation Round Table', Alphans have a broader 
     view.  The Ambassador considers both the Task force and the Operation 
     to be within the Domain:  Quest.  Moreover, the Ambassador is the 
     Alphan Commander of this Domain.  From the Alphan perspective, Domain: 
     Quest includes several Operations - Round Table is but one of them.  
     
     However, it may be noted that the Ambassador has chosen to personally 
     supervise Operation Round Table - underscoring its importance as 
     perhaps the most crucial operation of Domain: Quest.  So, even though 
     the SS Excalibur is only a single aspect of the entire endeavor, and 
     the Terrans and Proximans mere pawns in a larger game, the personnel 
     list places the Ambassador under the ludicrous title of 
     "Miscellaneous".  
     
     For the record, then:
     
     SS Excaliber, Commanding:  Capt. Lyn Sharona
     Task Force Camelot, Commanding:  Field Cmdr. Karban 541
     Operation Round Table, Commanding:  Trocia 12 and Elder Gabriel
     Domain Quest, Commanding:  the Alphan Ambassador
     
     Within the next few days, I will forward to you the content of the 
     messages that the Ambassador sent (before boarding ship) to the 
     Commanding Officers of the other Operations (principly Alphan) within 
     Domain Quest.  As a hint of the scope of this Domain, I would only 
     note here that it may not have been an accident that Alphan ships were 
     in the vicinity when Karban 541 last encountered the Yssdaak.  
     
     Very truly yours,

Subject:	SS Excalibur alterations

     In looking over the list of alterations, I notice that no expense has 
     been spared:  for example, a full-size theatre/meeting hall, eight (8) 
     holo-decks, 23 labs and 2 gyms.  
     
     What I find conspicuously absent is some part of the ship in which its 
     gravity can be adjusted.  Certainly there would be some practical use 
     in being able to train or work out in something other than 1G.  Any 
     space cruiser worth its salt would have at least one free-fall room 
     for training in 0G.  I'm sure that the Proximan contingent would lobby 
     for, at minimum, one gym space that could be altered to 2G.  
     
     Now perhaps this is so common that you didn't even mention it.  
     Nevertheless, the Ambassador would find it so comforting to have some 
     place (or places) to relax under lighter pressures, even if it had to 
     be in the gym.  What do you say?

P.S. Sergeant Commander Stillmist- this particularly includes Troopers
Lisa and Lyssandra.  Do not forget that Lyssandra has just turned
fifteen and is used to trusting all the males around her...

Because he is dangerous!

BTW:  Lyssandra is now fifteen, and Karban just noticed.:-)  Karban is
worried what with all the horny Proximans around a fifteen year old girl
is a hot ticket- especially one as beautiful and as intelligent as
Lyssandra.  I want to work with you to set up a program to follow
Lyssandra around.  Now- I don't want either you or I to invade her

decisions about whether she is in trouble or not.  I can also tag
certain individuals as trouble and give us a warning whereever they are
together.  If there is trouble we may need to act fast or we will be
doing damage control after the fact.    Can you design a smart program
to do that?

I have ordered no fraternization between the Proximans and the MI (to
which Lisa and Lyssandra now belong) so that may help.... (YEA

Task Force Camelot
*** MEMO
To:      Task Force Camelot
From:  Karban 541, Task Force Camelot Command, MI, CTS
CC:     Captain Lyn Sharona, XO Shaw Gisime', Trocia 12, Elder Gabriel,
Ambassador
Date:   08/08/55
Re:      Personnel, Resources, and Action Committee

This memo is to inform all personnel of the formation of a committee to
aid the personnel of Operation Round Table, Task Force Camelot and SS
Excalibur to operate in the most efficient manner possible.
The intention of the Personnel, Resources, and Action Committee,
henceforth known as PRAC, will be to distribute the knowledge base of
the Operation as widely as possible and to keep all elements of the
Operation in communication and informed.    It should also allow for a
synergistic expansion of our understanding of whatever issues or
decisions are before us.   PRAC meetings will also allow for all
elements of the operation to have a voice and give them an arena to
bring issues, ideas, and plans before the leadership of the
Operation.    At its most basic level, it will keep everyone informed of
the research/mission status.

During hands down, Condition Green, periods the PRAC will meet at 0900
hours every odd day beginning on 08/09/2255.  During Condition Yellow or
Red, or while we are in direct contact with Yssdaak or Friendlies, the
PRAC will meet every day at 0900 hours or as often as needed.
Stateroom A, near the bridge, is currently being renovated for this
purpose.  We will install computer pads, comm units and holo-display
devices for all seated members.

I have included a list of members of the PRAC.  Indented names are
personnel who are cleared to be in the PRAC meeting but are not "seated"
members.  Attendance at the PRAC is mandatory for the listed seated
members of Task Force Camelot.

*** PRAC Meeting List

Karban 541
Trocia 12
    Her secretary
    Bodyguard: Trooper Van Damne
Elder Gabriel
    His assistant
    Bodyguard: Sergeant Marla Wills
Ambassador
    Bodyguard: Trooper "ALAN"
Captain Lyn Sharona
First Officer Shaw Gisime'
Gregory Manning
Mr. Ishido (note: Mr. Ishido may be present only virtually)
Dr. Beltane
Dr. Barry
    Bodyguard: Nathan Brazil
Dr. Munroe
Nkillian Brox'inar
Colonel Hobbs
Sergeant Commander Elijah Moore
Sergeant Commander Daniel Stillmist



NOTE: Bodyguards may substitute alternate personnel so long as their
commanding officer clears them.
Any member of the committee may invite any mission personnel to join a
particular meeting so long as it is cleared by their commanding officer.

     Below is an abstract of our recent publication, "Power as function of

     communication proximity."  
     
     You are cordially invited to a presentation of the paper on Day 2 of

      The conference will be held in virtual space; connections may be made 
     via personal computer link or through shipboard computer connections 
     in the General Inquiry User Space.  Comments and questions are 
     encouraged.  Suggestions on resolving apparent inconsistencies in

     are welcome.

     I'm all for it.  Much as Karban 541 has had to develop an entire

     society to unfold.  It would be great to be able to start weaving the

     also give us a sense of being inside a larger universe.

Subject:	Re: SH: Possibility for Style of Play  


The cons are:
	1) It's a fair amount of work for you collecting data and thinking
	   stuff up.
	2) It requires a bit of ego suppression on the part of us players
	   to make sure everyone gets their due and doesn't feel left out.

The pros are:
	1) I've been in one campaign that did a lot of work in this area -- a
	   game set in the fantasy world of Harn, and it is far and away the
	   best campaign I've ever been in.  (That was a big group: a dozen
	   players each of which had at least two characters).  Those characters
	   didn't have adventures, they had *lives*.

	2) It builds on the work people do in the character generation system,
	   particularly in the careers area.  After all, the dice suggest
	   peaks and valleys in the course of a character's life, and figuring
	   out exactly what went on can be a lot of fun.

	3) It helps with the waits between games -- the players have something
	   to stay interested in.

I'd be for it on the basis of pro number one alone.  Let me suggest that you
at least take the step of collecting data saying what years people did above
or below average on PD, Wealth, and Status rolls.  Some interesting patterns
might emerge, which would help jump-start imaginations.

I am all for that.  I think it will add immeasurably. The only danger
would be if you used someone's infot hat they thought was confidential.
NBAH!  Who cares!:-)

I've spoken to the Ambassador -- he stopped me in a corridor.  He had a question
about my attidudes toward other races.

Lisa and Lysandra have expressed some reluctance toward making contact with him:
they find what I assume is a psionic signature unlike that which they're used to
somewhat discomfiting.  I've instructed them in what courtesies the Ambassador
warrants and explained to them that he means them no harm, they can't waste time
and energy trying to hide from him, and finally, the ship is going to seem a
lot smaller very soon than it did parked at Terra.

Of course, I'll be pleased to attend a meeting with him.  I'll see that Lisa
and Lysandra are presentable.

Subject:	RE: I have a few questions


Things I am interested in:
What level of Strategic Service(SS) training has the Captain had.
[jimjm]   [jimjm]  Captain Lyn Sharona
 She has a basic privateer liason course from the triculture war.
Her primary qualification is that she is known for having survived 40 blind 
jumps
and encounters with a black hole [jimjm]   as well a 16 career kills of 
Proximan Fighter craft.

Who  is the XO and how experienced is (s)he?
[jimjm]
[jimjm]  Shaw Gisime' - a Karman with 14 years in Startegic Services with 
several distinguished service medals and several Confed Awards for Valor.

 A very experienced Commander. More details later.

Does Alan have a name?
[jimjm]  Not yet.

What do you call ten hand of Proximan Marauders? (No- this is not the
lead in to a joke though several possible endings to that just occurred
to me:-))  Karban(and Alex)  will use their Proximan name since I don't
wnat to conbfuse them with our Marauders.  How about "Kr' Tenal"

[jimjm]  The actual name of the maurauders in P{roximan is T'kan. So five 
hands of T'kan

Are Dr. Beltane and Dr. Berry going to share managing the Science and
Research Team?  Or does Dr. Berry not care...?

[jimjm]  Dr. Barry cares ! Please have Dr. Beltane do it !

What is the title of the head of the Proximan Marauders- and how much
experience does he have?
[jimjm]   [jimjm]  Nkillian Brox'inar - Full Title: Y'fank dyo T'kan d'yo 
Han T'karta
Translation : Dagger of the Hand of the Imperial Guard. He is comfortable 
with the title Dagger Brox.

Are they acting under military command or are they rogue.  :-)  I.e. can
I use them in my ship defense plans and what level of use can I make of
them.  What are their duties?

[jimjm]  You can use them in the ship defense plans with the provisio that 
2 of them must be assigned to Nahabidian at all times. Their duties are to 
protect Nahabidian and the Council Reps.

I am going to assign bodyguards to the three politico's on board- I was
thinking of assigning Alan as a bodyguard for Ron's character- that
would keep him involved even if we were having high level normally
"officer/leaders-only-meetings" what do you think?

[jimjm]  Works for me. You may want to assign "Kickem" to one of the 
politicos.

Is the Doctor part of the Strategic Services Complement or my
complement.  Most people were clear in terms of where they fit on the
chain of command.  There are three main streams of command- I will
setail them below.  The Doctor was the weird one.  SO are the Proximan
Marauders- Are they attached to Strategic Services via Nahabidian or are
they tactical ground troops that are there so Nahabidian has the correct
escort but are really tactical service  troops
on top of that.  This also leads to the question of the Pleasure
Providers but I assume they will nbeassociated personnel with whichever
command chain they fall under.   Here is what I think is obvious:

[jimjm]  Technically the doctor is attached to the Task force but Trocia 
would probably suggest putting the medicos under Beltane's command since 
there will be overlap.
[jimjm]  Remember that the medical teams consists of
2 civie doctors , one nurse/labtech/comp op.
4 Strategic Services   [jimjm]  Doctors/Med Techs
4  [jimjm]  Tactical Services Med Techs

Operation Roundtable Command: Trocia 12 and Elder Gabrial
    - the Ambassador
    - Trocia's Counselor-in-training (name?) and her two clan sisters
    - his assistants, priest(?), secretary(?)
Task Force Camelot Command: Karban 541
    - the MI
    - Ishido and Yojimbo
    - com techs, and comp techs
    - science and research team [jimjm]   and medicos ?
    - associated personnel (bodyguards, assistants, secretaries...)
SS Excalibur Command: Captain  [jimjm]  Sharona
    - her crew
    - Travis McPherson
    - Nahabidian Drexel
    - associated personnel (spouses, family, assistants, ???).

Does that make sense?

In terms of the Normal Doctor's(since our doctor is a civilian) role on
a military ship of identifying people who are incapable of retaining
command, I suggest a protocol that the Doctor can make recommendations
under that section to Trocia or Gabrielle who can then act if they think
it is necessary.

PRAC: Personnel, Resources, and Action Committee :-) Suggested
complement: [people in square brackets are there but not participating
actively, i.e. seated members]  Jim tell me what you think- this will
allow all PCs to be involved in the planning sessions.  The purpose of
the PRAC meetings is to have short(emphasis short) meetings to make sure
everyone knows the state of research/mission statrus.  During hands down
periods like now we will only meet every other day at 0900 hours for
half an hour.  During alert periods or when we are in contact with
aliens we will meet every day at 0900 hours or as needed. I suggest we
use a stateroom near the bridge so Strategic personnel can get on the
post quiclkly if needed.  I will have Ishido work with McPherson to set
up a meeting room with all the amenities, holodisplay equipment,
controls/comp access for every seated member, etc.

I clear all this with Trocia and Elder Gabrielle, and ask for their
presence at these meetings.  I will also enroll the Captain.  I will
make it mandatory for my people.
[jimjm]  Of, coiurse. Rolled eyes.

Karban 541
Trocia 12, [her secretary, her MI bodyguard]
Elder Gabrial [his assistant, his MI bodyguard]
the Ambassador [Alan's character]
Sgt. Comm. Moore {I need my immediate chain of command at these meeting
in case I get cacked}
Sgt. Comm. Stillmist{see above}
Captain " [jimjm]  Lyn Sharona "{I made that up- just for convenience- call 
her
whatever you like}
her XO
Colonel Hobbs
Gregory Mannering{he will have an MI bodyguard if he ever leaves the
ship- otherwise I assume he doesn't want one shipboard.  Is that
accurate?} [jimjm]  Pretty much, something about "cramped style"
Mr. Ishido{probably virtually- I suspect he won't show up in person but
will be listening in and contributing that way}
Dr. Beltane
Dr. Berry [Nathan Brazil]
the head of the Proximan Marauders {Is that an Arms master?}
Dr. Munroe{I am thinking of assigning one the Proximan Marauders to
guard him:-):-)}

OKay- chain of command under me.  I have two seperate chains.  One is
Task FOrce command.  The other is MI command.

Task Force command:
Karban 541, Colonel Hobbs (because he has the broadest experience and is
trained in First Contact), Sgt. Commander Stillmist, Dr. Jonathon
Beltane, Sgt. Commander Moore, we're fucked.:-))

MI Command (I want to set it up so Harris is always the XO for whoever
is in Command but not high to be in mission command- does this make
sense?  If not, insert Harris after me instead of after Stillmist.):
[jimjm]  It it perfectly acceptable. Especially to Harris.
Fld. Cmmdr. 541, Sgt. Cmmdr. Moore, Sgt. Cmmdr. Stillmist, Sgt. Cmmdr.
Harris, Sgt. Marla Wills, Trpr. Van Damne, Trpr. Hughes, Trpr. "Alan",
Trpr. Lyssandra, Trpr. Lisa

[jimjm]  I have to admit I would almost love to see Lyssandra with Harris 
as an XO ;-)

Please reply.... I am also  completely open for any coaching you have on
not dominating the runs.  I am aware of my/my characters leaning towards
that and will be watching for it.   I thought I did okay, not great but
okay,  last run?  Thoughts?

By the way:  I love this campaign and you did awesome on Saturday.
Kudos.

Thank you for your note.  Your safety is my utmost concern.
     
By the way, my rank is "Field Commander" not "Commander General". 
Although I am honored you think so highly of me the rank "Commander 
General" belongs to the head of all Confederation Tactical and Strategic 
Services- Marion Sutaken.  I am sure all these military titles are 
confusing.

To Sgt. Cmmdr. Stillmist,

The Alphan Ambassador apparently thinks I am the commander general.   We
will see if he can obey orders like I am!  I have sent him a note
informing him of my correct title.

I will introduce you to him tonight.  I would like you to be very
perceptive when I introduce you.  I have learned something about him
that I think you and the girls may be able to perceive.  I don't want to
pre-condition you, so I will speak more of it after we meet with him.

Sincerely,
    F.C. Karban 541

I am assigning the following MI to be responsible for the protection of
there client.
You may use the Proximan Marauders- the T'kan- to support you in this.
Any guard you assign must be FULLY briefed on ship defense plans,
boarding evasion plans, evacuation, emergency exit routes, and escape
pod locations.   They need to be cleared by me and they must be clear
that their life is non-essential compared to their client.  The client
must live at ALL costs- even against the clients wishes if necessary.
No guard should stay on full alert longer than three hours.  You must be
with the client a minimum of one watch per day- I want you all
intimately familiar with your client.  Is that clear?

Trooper "Alan" - Your assignment is to guard the Alphan Ambassador.
Trooper Hughes - Your assignment is to guard Counselor 12
Sgt. Wills - Your assignment is to guard Elder Gabriel.

If I declare a code 12 your job is to get your client to the starboard
pinnace- which is stocked for long-term space travel, and can run
"silent"- and leave.  Sgt. Wills will be training all three of you on
piloting a pinnace in case she is killed or disabled.   Now- I don't
care if you hear me screaming for help, calling your names, begging for
help- if I have declared a code 12 your job is to get out.

Is that clear?

     Congratulations on your appointment to this important mission.  May we

     You are cordially invited to a festival of Proximan games to be held

     Transition).  
     
     Although it is understood that you are not Proximan by birth, and are 
     unlikely to be familiar with the tournaments or traditional festivals 
     of Proxima, it is thought you may enjoy the spectacle.  The 
     traditional celebrations of Proxima are very similar in spirit to the 
     ancient Terran games of jousting and melee.  Although through the 
     years, the Proximan games have become more stylized and ritualized, 
     there is still a great element of personal danger and, consequently, 
     much to do about honor andd prestige.

Subject:	SH: Xkalybr - About psi

     [Mr. GM - I am copying in Still Mist on this conversation, since I 
     think it will be of some interest to him, as well.]
     
     Just to get clear about certain aspects of how psi works in this 
     universe:
     
     Fore-seeing: 
     What's that like? - Are there images or just colors/flavors/tones?  
     Is fore-seeing done around a particular place or a particular person? 
     Do you see only what happens in the space you are in, or can you see 
     other spaces?  
     Do you see only people with whom you are familiar, or can you see 
     other people?
     What difference does 'distance' (either from place or people) make on 
     what is seen?
     What makes an image easy to interpret?  Is is just a function of 
     expertise and concentration?
     What is the effective 'range'? 
     Is there things like crystal balls to aid concentration? 
     If you use drugs for concentration (like Spice), how much of a boost 
     do you get?  
     Assuming that you need to be pretty drugged up to gain any effect, how 
     long are you effectively disabled (moments? minutes? hours? days?)? 
     
     Telepathy:
     Is is possible to use telepathy to 'talk' to other telepaths?  What 
     distance?  What range of expression (just vague feelings, or actual 
     words and phrases)?  other restrictions? 
     Is is possible to commmunicate to people who have no telepathy 
     themselves?
     What is Surface Read?
     In the text you gave me, it says telepathics are to 'influence other 
     minds', yet, under skills, you seem to have only passive abilities 
     (even Mind Meld/t seems passive).  Is there a separate skill to 
     'influence' someone?   
     If you can 'influence' someone, does it occur in the subject as a 
     general wish or urge to do something, or can they experience a command 
     to do something?  other restrictions?  
     
     Stealth & Deception:
     Are these only for hiding psi from others?  Or can they be used to 
     prevent someone, for example, from seeing/hearing/perceiving you?  
     Under Deception, does the subject perceive that you are using psi, but 
     is misled as to what skill you used, or only the content of what you 
     did with that skill?  In other words, can you make telepathy look like 
     biokinetics and precognition look like energetics - or can you just 
     make it look like you moved the window shades when you really moved 
     the clock?

Subject:	RE: I have a few questions


[jimjm]  Can't chat, heading to a customer site. Here are sdome Quick and Dirty answers.

When you get a moment- chat me....  This is a little long but if you
could just at least peruse it and see if anything leaps out at you....
I am going to write up our mission porders and all that sort of stuff
when I get names form you (Captian, XO, etc. ) and the response to this
post.  Obsessively yours.

Things I am interested in:
What level of Strategic Service(SS) training has the Captain had.  
[jimjm]  She has a basic privateer liason course from the triculture war.
Her primary qualification is that she is known for having survived 40 blind jumps 
and encounters with a black hole.

Who  is the XO and how experienced is (s)he?
[jimjm]  A very experienced Commander. More details later.

Does Alan have a name?
[jimjm]  Not yet.
 
What do you call ten hand of Proximan Marauders? (No- this is not the
lead in to a joke though several possible endings to that just occurred
to me:-))  Karban(and Alex)  will use their Proximan name since I don't
wnat to conbfuse them with our Marauders.  How about "Kr' Tenal"

[jimjm]  The actual name of the maurauders in P{roximan is T'kan. So five hands of T'kan

Are Dr. Beltane and Dr. Berry going to share managing the Science and
Research Team?  Or does Dr. Berry not care...?

[jimjm]  Dr. Barry cares ! Please have Dr. Beltane do it !

What is the title of the head of the Proximan Marauders- and how much
experience does he have?
[jimjm]  Later.

Are they acting under military command or are they rogue.  :-)  I.e. can
I use them in my ship defense plans and what level of use can I make of
them.  What are their duties?

[jimjm]  Later.

I am going to assign bodyguards to the three politico's on board- I was
thinking of assigning Alan as a bodyguard for Ron's character- that
would keep him involved even if we were having high level normally
"officer/leaders-only-meetings" what do you think?

[jimjm]  Works for me. You may want to assign "Kickem" to one of the politicos.

[jimjm]  Whoaaa ! This is getting long. I wil take it home tonite and reply tomorrow.

Is the Doctor part of the Strategic Services Complement or my
complement.  Most people were clear in terms of where they fit on the
chain of command.  There are three main streams of command- I will
setail them below.  The Doctor was the weird one.  SO are the Proximan
Marauders- Are they attached to Strategic Services via Nahabidian or are
they tactical ground troops that are there so Nahabidian has the correct
escort but are really tactical service  troops
on top of that.  This also leads to the question of the Pleasure
Providers but I assume they will nbeassociated personnel with whichever
command chain they fall under.   Here is what I think is obvious:

Operation Roundtable Command: Trocia 12 and Elder Gabrial
    - the Ambassador
    - Trocia's Counselor-in-training (name?) and her two clan sisters
    - his assistants, priest(?), secretary(?)
Task Force Camelot Command: Karban 541
    - the MI
    - Ishido and Yojimbo
    - com techs, and comp techs
    - science and research team
    - associated personnel (bodyguards, assistants, secretaries...)
SS Excalibur Command: Captain "Peterson"
    - her crew
    - Travis McPherson
    - Nahabidian Drexel
    - associated personnel (spouses, family, assistants, ???).

Does that make sense?

In terms of the Normal Doctor's(since our doctor is a civilian) role on
a military ship of identifying people who are incapable of retaining
command, I suggest a protocol that the Doctor can make recommendations
under that section to Trocia or Gabrielle who can then act if they think
it is necessary.

PRAC: Personnel, Resources, and Action Committee :-) Suggested
complement: [people in square brackets are there but not participating
actively, i.e. seated members]  Jim tell me what you think- this will
allow all PCs to be involved in the planning sessions.  The purpose of
the PRAC meetings is to have short(emphasis short) meetings to make sure
everyone knows the state of research/mission statrus.  During hands down
periods like now we will only meet every other day at 0900 hours for
half an hour.  During alert periods or when we are in contact with
aliens we will meet every day at 0900 hours or as needed. I suggest we
use a stateroom near the bridge so Strategic personnel can get on the
post quiclkly if needed.  I will have Ishido work with McPherson to set
up a meeting room with all the amenities, holodisplay equipment,
controls/comp access for every seated member, etc.

I clear all this with Trocia and Elder Gabrielle, and ask for their
presence at these meetings.  I will also enroll the Captain.  I will
make it mandatory for my people.

Karban 541
Trocia 12, [her secretary, her MI bodyguard]
Elder Gabrial [his assistant, his MI bodyguard]
the Ambassador [Alan's character]
Sgt. Comm. Moore {I need my immediate chain of command at these meeting
in case I get cacked}
Sgt. Comm. Stillmist{see above}
Captain "Janice Peterson"{I made that up- just for convenience- call her
whatever you like}
her XO
Colonel Hobbs
Gregory Mannering{he will have an MI bodyguard if he ever leaves the
ship- otherwise I assume he doesn't want one shipboard.  Is that
accurate?}
Mr. Ishido{probably virtually- I suspect he won't show up in person but
will be listening in and contributing that way}
Dr. Beltane
Dr. Berry [Nathan Brazil]
the head of the Proximan Marauders {Is that an Arms master?}
Dr. Munroe{I am thinking of assigning one the Proximan Marauders to
guard him:-):-)}

OKay- chain of command under me.  I have two seperate chains.  One is
Task FOrce command.  The other is MI command.

Task Force command:
Karban 541, Colonel Hobbs (because he has the broadest experience and is
trained in First Contact), Sgt. Commander Stillmist, Dr. Jonathon
Beltane, Sgt. Commander Moore, we're fucked.:-))

MI Command (I want to set it up so Harris is always the XO for whoever
is in Command but not high to be in mission command- does this make
sense?  If not, insert Harris after me instead of after Stillmist.):
Fld. Cmmdr. 541, Sgt. Cmmdr. Moore, Sgt. Cmmdr. Stillmist, Sgt. Cmmdr.
Harris, Sgt. Marla Wills, Trpr. Van Damne, Trpr. Hughes, Trpr. "Alan",
Trpr. Lyssandra, Trpr. Lisa

Please reply.... I am also  completely open for any coaching you have on
not dominating the runs.  I am aware of my/my characters leaning towards
that and will be watching for it.   I thought I did okay, not great but
okay,  last run?  Thoughts?

By the way:  I love this campaign and you did awesome on Saturday.
Kudos.

Subject:	SH: Do not forward- COnfidential Info

Just so you, as the GM, know- Dr. Beltane has told Karban in confidence
about the Ambassadors virtual friend/communal entity.  The Ambassador
told Beltane and asked Beltane not to tell me specifically, and no one
else either.

Beltane, of course, immediately told me.  I don't know anything about
it, but I am going to talk to Still mist about it and se eif he and/or
the girls have "seen" it.  As you can imagine it irritates and freaks
Karban out.  I am going to be really subtle about it and try not to
think too loud about it around the ambassador!:-)  I will run the
conversation with Stillmist at the next run.

Subject:	SH: Xkalybr - Alphan characteristics

     Here's a list of Alphan characteristics - in no particular order - 
     that have already surfaced as a part of play:  (Please let me know if 
     any of this is contrary to your outlook on the race).  
     
     * very adept politically
     * distinuish between different kinds of 'truth' (what's a 'lie', 
     really?)
     * notion of 'property' is foreign (everything belongs to anyone) 
     * very free with gifts
     * Alphans don't breed for psi - they feel that it doesn't work (the 
     really valuable psi abilities show up where you'd never suspect)
     * refer to psi as 'thinking'
     * use a drug called Spice (aka Spice Dust) to enhance concentration 
     while 'thinking' (using psi)
     * common Alphan social gatherings:  "talking groups" called 'salons'
     * take the long view - are not too concerned with 'running out of 
     time'
     * are laid back - not easily surprised - commonly a "don't worry, be happy" 
     attitude
     * mate late in life (certainly after 50)
     * social/family structure closer to what Terrans would call a commune; 
     not what Wiccans would call a coven
     * non-violent; use other means to keep order
     * allow police (of other races) to patrol spaceports on Alpha
     * have non-corporeal "companions" - hard to translate exactly, but 
     could be considered 'the spirits of the ancesters' or 'the 
     elders/mentors'
     * are generally ageless - hard to determine age from physical 
     appearance
     * don't have physical sports, only mental and social sports (politics 
     is a big one)
     * rank and status among other Alphans is important 
     * even though Alphans do not attend to the rank and prestige of 
     other races, an Alphan would consider it very rude to do anything 
     that would diminish the rank/status of, say, a Terran, in other 
     Terrans' eyes
     * very comfortable on board starships
     * prefer 0.5 G environment
      
     This is just what's been uncovered so far.  I will add to the list as 
     different things become 'common knowledge' about Alphans.  Thanks!

To make any roll you need to know four things(1) What skill applies to
the task being attempted
      In this example(ITE) it is EMPATHY.
(2) What statistic is the stat basis for the skill being used, and what
is it's value
      ITE it would be PSI for empathy, and let us say you have a 19
PSI..
(3) What is your RANK in that skill?
      ITE you have either RANK 7 or 11.
(4) What is the difficulty factor of the task one wishes to perform.
      The difficulty factor(DF) is dependant on a variety of factors-
how difficult
      is the task?  A 0 DF task is a task that 60% of the people in a
craft can do easily
      and as a part of the everyday routine. DF is a number from -10 to
+10

Now her eis how you calculate success chance:
(Stat Base)*3+ RANK*4 + DF*5

That is it.  Very simple.  SO.....
In the RANK 7 example above(say it is DF 0):
19*3 + 7*4 + 0*5 -> 57 + 28 -> 85% chance to make a successful empathy
roll.
In the RANK 11 example above(say it is also DF 0):
19*3 + 11*4 + 0*5 -> 57 + 44 -> 101% chance to make a successful empathy
roll.

That should be clear.. any questions?

I am going to make something up based on conversations Jim and I have
had.. jim will tell you if I am wrong.The Transition Drive was invented
out of  a combination of Alphan spatial  mathematics and Terran  fusion
technology.

A mathematician named Mak'ansor- or something like that- on Alpha
theorized that ther eswould be points at various locations in a heavy
gravity field (like a stars) that would be "empty". These points would
be connected to a similar hole in a "nearby" gravity field.  These holes
are created by superstrings linking and twisting together- this happens
all the time and then the superstrings split apart, but at certain
places in a gravity field under the correct conditions a "tunnel" is
formed of stable linked superstrings. This tunnel grows and grows and
grows until it destabilizes and disintigrates.  Every once in a blue
moon- but inevitably- two tunnels link and stabilize each other.  The
two holes at either end of these tunnels- once they have grown for a few
thosand years- are transition points.    When you ignite a Cagson Fusion
Displacement Drive (commonly known as a Transition Drive) on top of one
of these holes the two holes become one point- and everything in the
Fusion Displacement field ends up outside the other hole.   Most systems
have at least one transition point, two or three are not uncommon.
There is a rough correlate to geographic location.  You are mor elikely
to have a Transition point to a neighboring star but huge Transition
Tunnels bridging dozens and dozens znd dozens of stars have been found.
The tunneling mechanism is not completely understood.  SOme tiunnels are
short- some stretch across the galaxy(though this is rare).  In theory
there could be cross-galactic transition points but they would be very
VERY rare because the two tunnel segments would have to cross HUGE
distances before encountering the stabilizing influence of another
tunnel.

     Ok - some technical questions:
     
     I need to understand base chance rolls.  Let's say I want to make an 
     'empathy' roll.  What's the difference in base chance between rank 7 
     and rank 11 in empathy (a Psionics skill)?
     
     Please say what you can about the mathematical basis of how transition 
     jumps work - is it space/time? - is it FTL?  - what the heck is it?
     
     What's the name of the new race - the one that was recently mauled by 
     the Yssdak?  Do we even have a code name - like the Ferrets?  
     
     Thanks.

Not a problem.  In this sense I think the Elysian paradigm and the
Wiccan are very similar.  We are both "pagan" cultures!  Reality is a
fluid thing.

This is hard.  Karban comes from a culture where almost everything
except that which was written down was lost.  We probably lost well over
50% of our population.  Karban thinks it is her moral duty rto write
everything down and share it with as many people as possible to preserve
the integrity of the knowledge.  Hence the number of reports and
meetings!

Agreed.  Karban will agree as well.  Karban is actually good at
accepting new things- it's just hard to control them, and hence the
conflict!;-)  Karban didn't like the idea of being responsible for the
girls- she would have been her own last choice- but now that it has been
put on her she wants to control it out of her committment to the girls
and their success in life.  She also wants to teach the girls that life
is hard and you can't count on anything.  She wants them to get that so
they won't be hurt as much when reality tramples them as Karban knows it
will.

Subject:	Re: SH: Question about Morning studies and the girls  


Stillmist's focus is on the emotional and the spiritual.  He doesn't 
particularly object to Karban using non-Wiccan models for anything as long as
Karban doesn't try to put any of them forth as absolutes.  Probably one of the
first things Karban learns about Wiccans is that they don't believe in absolute
anything.  Questions with any sort of scope are guaranteed to have more than
one answer.  Knowing *a* truth is one thing -- knowing *the* truth is something
else again.

Of course, one of the things Karban finds extremely frustrating about Wiccans is
they don't write things down, they don't codify, because they believe that
writing things down can actually be destructive to learning.  It's all right
in areas of knowledge that are narrowly focused and highly compartmentalized.
MI suits have manuals because they're designed to work on certain principles.
It would take a lot of resources to remember everything in a maintenance manual.
You can't apply that same idea to something like politics.  There, the purpose
of writing it down is to preserve an idea because ideas often have a greater 
useful life than the people who think of them, but you can't allow yourself
to think that writing something like that down sanctifies it in any way.  If
you refuse to accept something new because it contradicts with what you've got
written down, you're not only being petulant and intolerant, you're opening
yourself and others up to extinction.

Oh my God.

I just realized we have a clan elder here.  I, of course will set up a
tea with Trocia, Stillmist, myself and the girls.  I will introduce them
to Trocia, and Trocia to them.  I will do that rapidly.  Probably day1.
I will also consult Trocia as to the girls upbringing.

Dave:  This is going to be very interesting.  You will find Karban very
amenable because she is clear she doesn't know squat about healthy
upbringing.  :-)  You struck a chord with Karb when you mentioned
bringing them back to family.

be conscious of that.  She thinks the girls need to get out of the
back-water, naive thinking Karb imagines Wiccan thinking to be.

She will use the ELysian model- I just didn't know if I could get a

gotten both.

MAybe not.  Karban wouldn'yt have looked much- she would have gotten the
Elysian curriculum and then asked for the best Terran curriculi there
was to get.  She might even have gone to some of the education experts
in the Cadre (I know- it makes Alex wince too...:-0)

Subject:	SH: Question about Morning studies and the girls

Do you have a sense of what we are going to go over in our morning
studies?

I forgot to mention that I brought along tutoring tapes designed for
10-25 year olds, to teach them science, history, politics, spanglesh,
reading, writing, mathematics, economics, literature, as much of and as
many subjects as they are interested in.

I am also committed to them learning Alphan and Proximan.  Speaking and
Reading and Writing.

Please let me know if a six-hour "school day" will interfere with your
training them and if you want to adjust or change their schooling
regimen.  The one Karban acquired is whatever is considered the most
reliable, and cutting edge training for children of that age currently
popular in the Confed and on Terra particularly.  You will find however
that Karban is emphasizing a lot on physical tasks- games, acrobatics,
decathlon, martial arts.

Alex suspects that Karban's planned regimen is too harsh for Lisa and
might work out well for Lysanndra.   Karban isn't extremely empathic to
what the children need. *shrug*  Karban's training also lacks "soul".
The only place that you will find any "soul" present in Karban's
teaching the kids is around martial arts and track and field events.
Mind you this is Alex speaking to Dave not Karban to Stillmist.    What
Karban will do is drop you an e-mail that includes their training and
learning schedule. :-)

Let me know what you think....

It was awesome. We had a great time and missed not having you there.


Your characters are already with us.. we have launched off from Terra in
a converted Frigate- we are on a five to 10 year mission to find an
alien race that was just discovered.  One of their ships was engaged in
a battle with Yssdaak(orange furry bad guys invading human space) battle
cruiser and fried it but all their complement was killed in the
exchange.  We don't know where they are from except in general terms but
we know they have better tech than us and are enemies of the Yssdaak.
Our job is to find them, make First Contact, make them into our allies,
and bring the calvary home to Terra.
Two retired, but very powerful and influential, members of the
Confederation Council are traveling with us and are in charge of the
Mission.

However- to get to them we will have to blind jump (probably many times)
through what is probably Yssdaak space.   We also have no ideas what
this race wants, etc, AND we are moving through space that few, in any,
humans have ever gone through.  Should be interesting!

Subject:	I have a few questions

Pookie:  There are some questions in here for you and you have a good
eye.  Tell me what you think.
Jim:
When you get a moment- chat me....  This is a little long but if you
could just at least peruse it and see if anything leaps out at you....
I am going to write up our mission porders and all that sort of stuff
when I get names form you (Captian, XO, etc. ) and the response to this
post.  Obsessively yours.

Things I am interested in:
What level of Strategic Service(SS) training has the Captain had.  Who
is the XO and how experienced is (s)he?

Does Alan have a name?

What do you call ten hand of Proximan Marauders? (No- this is not the
lead in to a joke though several possible endings to that just occurred
to me:-))  Karban(and Alex)  will use their Proximan name since I don't
wnat to conbfuse them with our Marauders.  How about "Kr' Tenal"

Are Dr. Beltane and Dr. Berry going to share managing the Science and
Research Team?  Or does Dr. Berry not care...?

What is the title of the head of the Proximan Marauders- and how much
experience does he have?
Are they acting under military command or are they rogue.  :-)  I.e. can
I use them in my ship defense plans and what level of use can I make of
them.  What are their duties?

I am going to assign bodyguards to the three politico's on board- I was
thinking of assigning Alan as a bodyguard for Ron's character- that
would keep him involved even if we were having high level normally
"officer/leaders-only-meetings" what do you think?

Is the Doctor part of the Strategic Services Complement or my
complement.  Most people were clear in terms of where they fit on the
chain of command.  There are three main streams of command- I will
setail them below.  The Doctor was the weird one.  SO are the Proximan
Marauders- Are they attached to Strategic Services via Nahabidian or are
they tactical ground troops that are there so Nahabidian has the correct
escort but are really tactical service  troops
on top of that.  This also leads to the question of the Pleasure
Providers but I assume they will nbeassociated personnel with whichever
command chain they fall under.   Here is what I think is obvious:

Operation Roundtable Command: Trocia 12 and Elder Gabrial
    - the Ambassador
    - Trocia's Counselor-in-training (name?) and her two clan sisters
    - his assistants, priest(?), secretary(?)
Task Force Camelot Command: Karban 541
    - the MI
    - Ishido and Yojimbo
    - com techs, and comp techs
    - science and research team
    - associated personnel (bodyguards, assistants, secretaries...)
SS Excalibur Command: Captain "Peterson"
    - her crew
    - Travis McPherson
    - Nahabidian Drexel
    - associated personnel (spouses, family, assistants, ???).

Does that make sense?

In terms of the Normal Doctor's(since our doctor is a civilian) role on
a military ship of identifying people who are incapable of retaining
command, I suggest a protocol that the Doctor can make recommendations
under that section to Trocia or Gabrielle who can then act if they think
it is necessary.

PRAC: Personnel, Resources, and Action Committee :-) Suggested
complement: [people in square brackets are there but not participating
actively, i.e. seated members]  Jim tell me what you think- this will
allow all PCs to be involved in the planning sessions.  The purpose of
the PRAC meetings is to have short(emphasis short) meetings to make sure
everyone knows the state of research/mission statrus.  During hands down
periods like now we will only meet every other day at 0900 hours for
half an hour.  During alert periods or when we are in contact with
aliens we will meet every day at 0900 hours or as needed. I suggest we
use a stateroom near the bridge so Strategic personnel can get on the
post quiclkly if needed.  I will have Ishido work with McPherson to set
up a meeting room with all the amenities, holodisplay equipment,
controls/comp access for every seated member, etc.

I clear all this with Trocia and Elder Gabrielle, and ask for their
presence at these meetings.  I will also enroll the Captain.  I will
make it mandatory for my people.

Karban 541
Trocia 12, [her secretary, her MI bodyguard]
Elder Gabrial [his assistant, his MI bodyguard]
the Ambassador [Alan's character]
Sgt. Comm. Moore {I need my immediate chain of command at these meeting
in case I get cacked}
Sgt. Comm. Stillmist{see above}
Captain "Janice Peterson"{I made that up- just for convenience- call her
whatever you like}
her XO
Colonel Hobbs
Gregory Mannering{he will have an MI bodyguard if he ever leaves the
ship- otherwise I assume he doesn't want one shipboard.  Is that
accurate?}
Mr. Ishido{probably virtually- I suspect he won't show up in person but
will be listening in and contributing that way}
Dr. Beltane
Dr. Berry [Nathan Brazil]
the head of the Proximan Marauders {Is that an Arms master?}
Dr. Munroe{I am thinking of assigning one the Proximan Marauders to
guard him:-):-)}

OKay- chain of command under me.  I have two seperate chains.  One is
Task FOrce command.  The other is MI command.

Task Force command:
Karban 541, Colonel Hobbs (because he has the broadest experience and is
trained in First Contact), Sgt. Commander Stillmist, Dr. Jonathon
Beltane, Sgt. Commander Moore, we're fucked.:-))

MI Command (I want to set it up so Harris is always the XO for whoever
is in Command but not high to be in mission command- does this make
sense?  If not, insert Harris after me instead of after Stillmist.):
Fld. Cmmdr. 541, Sgt. Cmmdr. Moore, Sgt. Cmmdr. Stillmist, Sgt. Cmmdr.
Harris, Sgt. Marla Wills, Trpr. Van Damne, Trpr. Hughes, Trpr. "Alan",
Trpr. Lyssandra, Trpr. Lisa

Please reply.... I am also  completely open for any coaching you have on
not dominating the runs.  I am aware of my/my characters leaning towards
that and will be watching for it.   I thought I did okay, not great but
okay,  last run?  Thoughts?

By the way:  I love this campaign and you did awesome on Saturday.
Kudos.

On PAge 14 -put the description of the table on the SAME page as the

1 eep per 10 hours of training with a teacher????  Are you mad?  That
means I could train in Aikido with Fabienne who is a black belt plus in
AIkido for hour-and a half a day for SIX months and get 30 eps for
that?  That would low me to buy a RANK 6 in AIkido with no suppoert
skills- no throw, no hold, no pressure points.  And RANK 6 in your
system is Dedicated Amateur....  I am not so sure.

SO POOLS:  I iwll writ ethis up cleaner for you if you want.. But let me
make sure I understand....
Number of skills in a pool= (RANK of highest rank skill in pool)/2 + 1
VALUE= The ranks of all the above added together as a percentage
addition.

Isa that correct?

This might be in the missing matter after APPEARENCE.

On my Character Sheet I have the following non-standard stats:

Height, Weight, Family Standing, Social Standing, Appearence, Age Build,
Sex, Race

How is Family Standing, Social Standing, and Appearence run.

Also:  Age-> what are we going to do about age differential.  Alan's
chacracter is going to be around 19 and CHris around 51.  Chris's
character on a straight linear rolled history will LITERALLY have two to
three times as many skills, etc as Alan's.   ???  It might be logical
but is unFAIR IN TERMS OF GAME BALANCE.  I recommend a 10 year or 15
year maximum on EFFECTIVE years of training.  That will keep 70 year old
Alphans from dominating the game..... In other words you pivk 15 yearsof
your life to roll under and then your character coasts for three years
and then has an "effective" trainignyear again.  and 18 years olds will
be ambitious, and slightly less skilled than veterans..

ALSO: Chris wants a Defensively oriented Marauder.  A Maruader with
Heavier shields, less armament, maybe evenv some portable shield

Subject:	Well, I got the Character Generation document... 


I'm assuming the 21 pages I got out of that mailing are all there is.  If that
is not the case, then I'm not quite sure where the rest of it went.

Having perused this material, it seems the generation process is as follows:

1) Divvy up the 125 points among the 10 primary statistics.
	Okay, that's fairly straightforward.  Just arithmetic.
	Those 125 points, as far as I can tell, produce the
	Average Daily Adult Human.

2) Modify for race.
	I've received no material that indicates how we ought to adjust for
	race.  This suggests either none of the permutations of human resulting
	from differences in gender or origin star vary enough from this norm to
	matter.  Correct me if I'm wrong.  I suspect I am.

3) Derive the calculated statistics.
	Also straightforward -- just more arithmetic.

4) Set up the other statistics.
	Height, Weight, and Appearance look like you just pick.  Since I've
	not seen any racial templates the formulas do not yet serve a purpose,
	though I could always just work with 20th century norms.  There's no
	range given for Appearance: does it vary over the 5-25 range as well?
	Does it cost anything to be beautiful or ugly?  Is it a roll?
	The Speeds are just more math.

5) Select some skills based on original culture.
	If any material enabling this has emerged, I haven't seen it.  Based on
	what I have seen, I'm thinking of this character as coming from a

Well, I've been through the requisite psych-up (if you count Showtime's 
"Stargate" series), and I am eager to play.

Option One for a character is, of course, Ishido.  He's well-integrated 
into the Military structure, or at least Karb's little clique.  He's been 
exposed to Yssdaak and lived, gets along well with psionic uber-children, 
and may eventually get a uniform that fits him.

Options Two and Three are provided only in case you don't want to run 
cyber-stuff, or think Ishido's low-G background is gonna be a huge 
liability.


Option Two is a sapper, a demolition expert.  Explosives, irradiants, 
acids and grav field generators.. he is expert in all the ways of making 
big things into little things.  He cultivates the expected "cowboy" 
image, but is very conscious of 'the book' when it counts.

Option Three is a pilot.  Not just any pilot, but one of the hottest ones 
I can generate.  He lives for speed.  He may or may not have a death wish 
(Psych isn't talking), but if he does, he is ethically incapable of 
acting on it.  Raised Calvinist or Cestus Dei, whichever works better.



Timeline stuff:

Aside from giving my spell-checker a workout (can you believe it didn't 
list "coelecanth"?  I had to look it up), it looks interesting.  I 
suspect, though, that Real World events will leave you running a parallel 
timeline (from ours) before long.

The only question I had (aside from a few of the names) was the 
rediscovery and liberation of the planet Elysia; it apparently happens in 
2143, and then again in 2233.  (I guess the first one didn't take?)

Also, are Wheelworlds still part of the history?  I didn't see them 
mentioned, and the rapidity with which Transition Drive overtok the 
gauss-jammers means they weren't the natural stage of things that they 
were at one time.



Anyway, that's where I'm at at the moment.

Subject:	SH: Karban 541 

My character is a 39-year-old officer in an Elite military unit called
the Mechanized Infantry.  I am what is called a Field Commander which is
somwhere between a Colonel and a Captain.   The Mechanized Infantry are
like the Starship Troopers of Heinlein fame.  We use these big expensive
suits of powered armor that have more combat capability than a modern
tank.

I am a woman, and I come from a planet named Elysia that is
only-inhabited by women.  I was born pathogenetically(I had
"co-mothers").   I am fairly well known for three reasons:

(1) My mother is the Senate Representative of my planet to the
Confederation(Confed).
(2) I was called the "Butcher of Pulhar" by the Tabloids after I
commanded a mission several years ago
in which I had 60 suspected rebels executed, and thus forced the
surrender of the rebel units.  I was cleared of all wrong-doing.
(Though I was demoted from my field command- make of that what you will)

(3) I am know as the "Hero from Hell" in the Tabloids recently when I
returned after sucessfully leading the first "real" combat mission
against the Yssdaak in a system called "Hell" by the inhabitants.

I am something of a control-freak, very compentant, cool under fire, and
am training to command at the strategic level as well as at the tactical
level.  I think I am going to be the commanding officer in this mission
whatever it is and I am bucking for a promotion back to Division
Commander.  (I have been there and back twice now.  *sigh*)

Karban will not reveal all this to you - I tried to only include info
that was public knowledge.

As I said I have written Karban's story and with Jim's permission (there
are top secret things in there- Jim?  anything I can't let them see if
they want?????) I will e-mail it to anyone who requests.

Okay- let's rock!  People can call me too....

Interlude

The tall, blonde woman blinked her eyes several times as she surveyed
the damaged craft.  Her eyes flicked across the screens laid out before
her.

Before her in the large office were twenty view screens, deluging
the office in a cacophony of light and sound.  The tech sitting behind
her and by the door looked up nervously at all the busyness on
the view wall.  She watched as the officer took a laser pen and
tagged one of the screens with it.

"Corporal? "

"Yes, Ma'am?"  The voice was tinny with a hint of distortion as his
communicator bridged the gulf of space and radiation between him and the

ship the Field Commander sat in.

"There seems to be some scoring damage on the starboard exhaust- please
give me an analysis.  Are those graser burns? "

"I am sending a team now."

Her microphones were filled with the contained, echoing breathing of a
dozen men as the teams crawled around the alien craft.  She focused on
one of the helmet cameras and zoomed in on a particular control that
was adjacent to the giant block of black and orange metal that appeared
to be an airlock.  She toggled a switch and leaned forward as
she studied the control.

Simultaneously, she watched a team beginning to enter the craft through
a giant hole in its port side.

"Major!  Watch for shimmer fields.  With all this radiation and dust, a
Yssdaak in a shimmer field will be almost invisible to any of our
sensors. "

"Yes, Ma'am."  There was a hint of exasperation in Major Takom's voice
as he slowed down the pace of his scouts.

"Corporal.  Get a stat of that control panel to Beltane right away.  We
need to find out..."

A shout interrupted her and two screens went black.

"Major Takom- status!"

"I don't know!  I lost comm link to two of my men.  Geysa and Pauls are
both..."

She blinked once rapidly as she saw the flash of metal in his helmcam
and then his screen went black.

"All units pull back from the ship!!   We may have Ykkraine battle
robots
on the field.  All MI- change to PEX ammo."

The chatter of Parkhursts firing ripped through the office the Field
Commander was sitting in.  She began barking orders and her eyes leapt
from screen to screen with lightning speed.   She heard the tell tale
*pings* of standard Parkhurst needle rounds ricocheting off metal.  The
thump of TH32 Sonic Grenades- developed specifically for the Yssdaak-
pealed from several teams at once.  The screen came alive with targets.
Yssdaak soldiers in battle harness and battle robots swarmed out of the
shadows of the giant alien ship.  Hundreds of them.

"Damn- it's a trap!  Get Ishido and his computer out of there!  I want a

whole squad on him!  As soon as Ishido is on board LIFT all shuttles!
Go! Go!"

Cursing to herself as her fingers flashed across the terminal screen in
front of her she split part of her attention away from managing the
retreat from the wreck and started analyzing the implications....

It was a battle cruiser class ship lying there on the surface of the
asteroid.  No one would scuttle a battle cruiser just to catch a few
ground
troops.  That meant...

The deck shuddered under her and the faded roar of distant explosions
sang through the hull.  The intruder alert klaxon roared to life.
Suddenly the voice of the First Officer rang through the corridor of
the ship alerting the crew to the intrusion of Yssdaak through the
hull.  She smiled grimly.  That made more sense.

She strapped the needler pistol onto her belt and laid her Parkhurst on
the wall next to her.  She quickly flicked some keys on her terminal.

"Shuttle pilots- belay the order to return to Mother- go silent- repeat
go silent.  We have a Code 54 Red here- assume we are compromised unless

you get a signal 11.  All ships confirm. "

As the shuttles confirmed she got up and grabbed her pressure suit.  As
she began to thrust her legs into the p-suit she turned and spoke to a
screen.

"Corporal- you are in charge of ground tactics and the withdrawal.  When

you achieve withdrawal go underground until you hear from me.  Code 43!"

"Aye, aye, Ma'am!"

She then bent over the console and switched to the internal screens.
Her face grew darker as she saw orange-furred shapes tearing amongst the

silent, giant, mechanical shells that were the Mech suits- the power of
the Mechanized Infantry division she commanded.  She sighed, and pressed

a three key sequence rapidly.

The ship rolled as a huge series of simultaneous explosions ripped
through the ship.  The screens she had been looking at went black.  She
nodded and then turned as she heard a sound at the door.

The *Abandon Ship* klaxon sounded as the door disintegrated under
projectile fire from outside.  She sealed her helmet and told the
quivering tech in the corner to suit up.   The technician gasped and
began to cry.  The Field Commander frowned and threw her needler at the
tech.

"Here- wait for one of the bastards to sink their claws into you then
press this against their side and pull the trigger.  You may survive for

the next one."

The door flew completely open and a large, furry, eight-foot form
clothed in combat armor filled the doorway.  It looked surprised to be
facing the barrel of a Parkhurst.  The Field Commander smiled when she
noted the red ring of blood on its mouth.  Apparently, it had taken its
helmet off to snack on some crew members.

"Welcome to hell...," she said with a grim smile as she pulled the
trigger and it snapped its projectile weapon up.

The click of a jammed chamber echoed through the room.  A curse
on the ammo manufacturer was her last coherent thought as the alien's
slugs tore through her body.

Okay, I've been over the stuff you mailed out (basically three files, right?)
and I've had the following basic character concepts:

A 'special talent' like the guy in Starship Troopers they brought in to map
the Arachnid hives.  That sort of depends on what sort of psionic powers, if
any, exist in the campaign.

Someone who wears a spook suit.

I was also considering a demolitions/ordnance disposal specialist, but this
may have been obsoleted by the high index of man-portable firepower....

(1) Someone should start a conversation for scheduling SHapeshifters

(2) Chris asked me to ask you whether you had too many people already or

owuld relay his request to you.

He would also like a copy of the SH history when you are done  I told
him we don't have the master done, never mind a player-ready copy!:-)

He sent this description of his character.  I like it- very interesting.

- -------
My character is an employee of a zaibatsu.  Although more than two
thirds of the other multi-planetaries are larger than it is, nearly
70% of this zaibatsu's ownership is directly held by one person, the
Magnate of Edessa.

Edessa is located in the Charybdis system in the Thule Nebula.  There
are several systems within the Nebula.  Each has transition points to
some of the other systems, but other than the Charybdis system, none
of the systems have transition points leading out of the Nebula.

  The Charybdis system is quite unusual: a Trinary star system
composed of a G-class and K-class "pair" in rotation with a more
distant Neutron Star.  The bodies in the system are as follows:
Tarterus, (Alpha Charybdis 1), is molten.
Quirinus (Alpha Charybdis 3), [1.8G, 120% Terran radius, 50% water,
temperate region warmer than Terra] with one moon, Bellona.
Vesta (Alpha Charybdis 4), [0.85G, 90% Terran radius, no water; a
Mars-Class planet habitable only by domes].
Edessa, [0.9G, 75% Terran radius, 65% water, large polar caps,
temperate regions colder than Terra] in orbit about Mulciber (Alpha
Charybdis 5), [].  Also orbiting Mulciber are two other moons, Pales
and Liber.

There are also three other un-inhabitable bodies (actually, one Moon
sized body and two large clusters of asteroids which were once Moon
sized bodies), in extremely eccentric orbits about both stars:
Alecto, Tisiphone, and Megaera.  These three bodies are alternately
frozen and thawed as they proceed in between Alpha and Beta
Charybdis.  They pass throught orbits 2-6 with potentially
devastating effects.

  There are also two asteroid belts roughly in the position of orbit
2 and 6.  The one in orbit 6 is more a ring of vapor.  These are the
result of collisions over the last few million years with the planet
at orbit two and the gas giant in orbit 6.

  As a result of the complex tidal forces in play in the Charybdis
system, the transition points are grouped together in two clusters.
At each cluster a station has been constructed.  The Janus station
wards the cluster of transition points that lead to and from the
Thule Nebula systems.  The Terminus station wards the cluster of
transition points that lead to and from the systems outside of the
Thule Nebula.

As such, the early inhabitants not only colonized the Thule systems,
but also insured that all trade had to run through the Charybdis
system.  Naturally, fees were charged for transport through the
system, in both directions with the revenues going directly into the
Magnates coffers.  The Magnate invested and diversified, eventually
reinforcing the success of Edessa, Ltd. by financing the [some major
tech/military advance].  Edessa is lightly populated.  Mostly the
estates of the extended family of the Magnate and the well-to-do of
the Charybdin system.

This did not help, however, when the Yisdoc hit Edessa recently and
eliminated 100% of the resident population.  The Magnate and the
second eldest child (assumed on planet, was currently in in-system
military service) were missing along with the rest of the population.
 The Magnate's wife and two youngest children, were on holiday on
[planet].  The eldest child was working on [planet] doing [something
political] after having left the military [years] earlier.  The third
eldest was in school on [Alpha/Mars/L5].

It is the intention of the current Magnate to get her husband, son,
and as many of the other Edessan's as possible back from the Yisdoc.
As both a planetary and a Zaibatsu Senate representitive, she has
exerted pressure to have an expedition created for that purpose.  She
is funding a large part of the current expedition and has insisted
that a Zaibatsu representative be included.  My character is either
that representative or the assistant/bodyguard of that
representative.
