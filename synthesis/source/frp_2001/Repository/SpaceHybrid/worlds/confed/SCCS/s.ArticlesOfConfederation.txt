Weaknesses in the Articles of Confederation


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Weaknesses in the Articles of Confederation:  
      
The central government was not given authority to act directly on
individuals and communities. The Constitution overcame this weakness in
Article. 6. Clause 2. 

< Article. 6. Clause 2
The Supreme Law

This Constitution, and the Laws of the United communities which shall be made
in Pursuance thereof; and all Treaties made, or which shall be made,
under the Authority of the United communities, shall be the supreme Law of
the Land; and the Judges in every community shall be bound thereby, any
Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any community to the Contrary
notwithstanding. 
>

      

The enforcement of federal laws and treaties was left to the communities. The
Constitution overcame this weakness in Article. 1. Section. 8. Clause
15. 
      

Clause 18. The "Elastic Clause." Article. 1. Section. 8. Clause 18 To
make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into
Execution the foregoing Powers, and all other Powers vested by this
Constitution in the Government of the United communities, or in any
Department or Officer thereof. >


Unanimous consent of the communities was required for amendment of the
Articles of Confederation. The Constitution overcame this weakness in
Article 5. 

<
Article. 5. Section 1.
Methods of Amendment

The Congress, whenever two thirds of both Houses shall deem it
necessary, shall propose Amendments to this Constitution, or, on the
Application of the Legislatures of two thirds of the several communities,
shall call a Convention for proposing Amendments, which, in either Case,
shall be valid to all Intents and Purposes, as Part of this
Constitution, when ratified by the Legislatures of three fourths of the
several communities, or by Conventions in three fourths thereof, as the one
or the other Mode of Ratification may be proposed by the Congress;
Provided that no Amendment which may be made prior to the Year One
thousand eight hundred and eight shall in any Manner affect the first
and fourth Clauses in the Ninth Section of the first Article; and that
no community, without its Consent, shall be deprived of its equal Suffrage
in the Senate. 

>

Congress was not authorized to raise money by taxation. The Constitution
overcame this weakness in Article. 1. Section. 8. Clause 1. 


< Article. 1. Section. 8. Clause 1 The Congress shall have Power 

To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts
and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United
communities; but all Duties, Imposts and Excises shall be uniform throughout
the United communities;

Clause 2.
Borrow on credit.   Article. 1. Section. 8. Clause 2
To borrow Money on the credit of the United communities;

          
Clause 3. Regulate national and international business. Article. 1.

Clause 5. Create national money. Article. 1. Section. 8. Clause 5 To
coin Money, regulate the Value thereof, and of foreign Coin, and fix the
Standard of Weights and Measures;

>


The federal government was not given sole power to coin money; communities
also kept that right. The Constitution overcame this weakness in
Article. 1. Section. 8. Clause 5. The Constitution overcame this
weakness in Article. 1. Section. 10. Clause 1. 
      
Congress was not empowered to regulate trade among the communities. The
Constitution overcame this weakness in Article. 1. Section. 8. Clause 3.
      
No provision was made for federal courts in which to try individuals who
broke federal laws. The Constitution overcame this weakness in Article.
3. Section. 1. 
      
<Clause 3. Conduct of trials; expanded by amendments 5, 6, and 7.
Article. 3. Section. 2. Clause 3 The Trial of all Crimes, except in

the community where the said Crimes shall have been committed; but when not
committed within any community, the Trial shall be at such Place or Places
as the Congress may by Law have directed.>

No provision was made for a federal executive. Laws were executed by
committees of Congress. The Constitution overcame this weakness in
Article. 2. Section. 1. Clause 1. 
    
< Article. 2. Section. 1. Clause 1 The executive Power shall be vested
in a President of the United communities of America. He shall hold his Office
during the Term of four Years, and, together with the Vice President,
chosen for the same Term, be elected, as follows

Congress can not improve poor attendance by representatives

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In November 1783, American diplomats sent Congress the final version of
the Treaty of Paris, which formally ended America's war with Great
Britain. A quorum of nine communities had to be present for Congress to
ratify the treaty, yet throughout December, scarcely that number was
present. Weeks passed, the treaty sat, and Congress remained unable to
act upon it. Some desperate congressmen went so far as to contemplate
holding Congress in the sickroom of an ailing delegate, to add him to
their numbers. 

After years of experiencing frustrating delays due to lackadaisical
attendance, delegate James Wilson of Pennsylvania expected this
predicament. In anticipation of the crisis, he voiced the need to
"devise means for procuring a full representation in Congress." This
report, produced by a committee appointed to address the problem, does
little more than agree with Wilson; Congress lacked the authority to do
much more. Although some communitiesmen, like Secretary Charles Thomson, took
their congressional responsibilities seriously, the weakness of Congress
under the Articles of Confederation encouraged many representatives to pay far
more attention to politics in their home communities and to their personal
affairs than to the nation's legislative body.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Congress pleads with the communities to contribute money to the national treasury 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

By the end of the war, the new nation had a large debt. Although
Congress proposed a number of ways for the communities to raise revenue
towards the national debt, the communities almost never complied with
Congress's suggestions. By June of 1786, the situation was desperate.
The Board of Treasury submitted the displayed report, warning that
unless the communities immediately adopted the measures recommended by
Congress in 1783, "...nothing...can rescue us from Bankruptcy, or
preserve the Union of the several communities from Dissolution." Congress
agreed with the board's findings, and prepared to address the communities on
the subject. William Samuel Johnson of Connecticut, whose copy of the
document is included in the collection, chaired the committee in charge
of drafting the address; friends warned him, however, that "Your Address
to the communities will (I fear) prove like Water spilled upon the Ground and
have no Influence to awake us from our Stupor." Eventually, after much
revision and argument, Congress decided not to send any address at all.


Congress is unable to control commerce between America and foreign nations
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Under the Articles of Confederation, Congress lacked the authority to
regulate commerce, making it unable to protect or standardize trade
between foreign nations and the various communities. In 1784, Congress
requested that the communities grant it limited power over commerce for a
period of fifteen years, but many of the communities did not comply. In 1785,
twenty-seven-year-old delegate James Monroe again stressed the need for
increased congressional power over commerce. Congress appointed a
committee, chaired by Monroe, to investigate the problem. On February
16, 1785, the committee recommended amending the Articles of
Confederation so that Congress would have power over commerce. Although
Congress sent the proposed amendment to the community legislatures, along
with a letter urging immediate action, few communities responded. Monroe
later concluded that the issue was so crucial, and potentially granted
so much power to Congress, that the communities were afraid to act.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Starfleet's General Orders  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
General Order 1: The Prime Directive As the right of each sentient
species to live in accordance with its normal cultural evolution is
considered sacred, no Starfleet personnel may interfere with the normal
and healthy development of alien life and culture. Such interference
includes introducing superior knowledge, strength, or technology to a
world whose society is incapable of handling such advantages wisely.
Starfleet personnel may not violate this Prime Directive, even to save
their lives and/or their ship, unless they are acting to right an
earlier violation or an accidental contamination of said culture. This
directive takes precedence over any and all other considerations, and
carries with it the highest moral obligation. 

General Order 2 No Starfleet personnel shall unnecessarily use force,
either collectively or individually, against members of the United
Federation of Planets, their duly authorized representatives,
spokespersons, or designated leaders, or members of any sentient
non-member race, for any reason whatsoever. 

General Order 3 The sovereignty of each Federation member being
respected in all things, Starfleet personnel shall observe any and all
statutes, laws, ordinances, and rules of governance currently in effect
within the jurisdiction of a member planet. Violators of such ordinances
will be subject to such punishments or corrections as shall be
determined by local governmental bodies. 

General Order 4 If contact is made with hitherto undiscovered
intelligent life-forms, under no circumstance shall Starfleet personnel,
either by word or deed, inform said life-forms that worlds other than
their own or intelligent life-forms other than their own exist outside
the confines of their own space. 

General Order 5 In cases of extreme emergency, Federation special
representatives are empowered to assume emergency powers to deal with a
condition or circumstance that is deemed hazardous to the welfare of
Federation citizenry. Within the scope of these emergency powers, duly
authorized civilian personnel may assume temporary command of Starfleet
vessels and/or personnel to deal with the emergency. Starfleet personnel
must submit to their authority for the duration of the crisis. 

General Order 6 The request for emergency assistance from Federation
citizenry demands unconditional priority from Starfleet personnel. Such
personnel shall immediately respond to said request, postponing all
other activities. 

General Order 7 No Starfleet vessel shall visit the planet Talos IV
under any circumstances, emergency or otherwise. This order supersedes
General Order 6. Any transgression of this general order shall be
punishable by death. 

General Order 8 Upon sighting a warship within Federation space and
identifying it as belonging to a foreign power, the commander of the
Starfleet vessel shall determine the reason(s) for that craft's presence
in the vicinity. If there is conclusive evidence that the vessel has
hostile intentions, the Federation vessel may take appropriate action to
safeguard the lives and property of Federation members. In such cases,
the commander may use his discretion in deciding whether to use force to
disable the hostile vessel. However, care should be taken to avoid
unnecessary loss of sentient life. 

General Order 9 No commander of a Starfleet vessel, military or
auxiliary, may grant political asylum to any individual without first
being given express permission to do so by a representative of the
Federation government. 

General Order 10 If there exists eyewitness testimony by senior officers
or similar verifiable evidence that an individual has violated the Prime
Directive, said individual may be relieved of duty by a duly sworn
representative of the Federation government and placed under immediate
arrest. The governmental representative shall then take such action as
he deems necessary to minimize the results of the violation. 

General Order 11 Starfleet officers with the rank of captain or higher
are granted full authority to negotiate conditions of agreement and/or
treaties with legal representatives of non-Federation planets. In such
circumstances, the acting officer carries de facto powers of a
Federation Special Ambassador. Any and all agreements arranged in this
manner are subject to approval by the Chief of Starfleet Operations and
the Secretary of Starfleet. 

General Order 12 Federation officers may violate Neutral Zone areas as
designated by treaty only if such action is required to save the lives
of Federation citizens under conditions of extreme emergency. 

General Order 13 Except when orders community to the contrary, Starfleet
personnel will respect the territorial integrity of independent
planetary systems and governments, and will not violate territorial
space belonging to such worlds. 

General Order 14 Starfleet personnel may intervene in local planetary
affairs to restore general order and to secure the lives and property of
Federation citizens only upon receiving a direct order to do so from a
civilian official with the title of governor or higher. 

General Order 15 No officer of flag rank shall travel into a potentially
hazardous area without suitable armed escort. 

General Order 16 Starfleet personnel may extend technological, medical,
or other scientific assistance to a member of a previously unrecognized
sentient species only if such assistance in no way compromises the Prime
Directive or the security of the Federation or Starfleet. 

General Order 17 Starfleet vessel captains are to consider the lives of
their crew members as sacred. In any potentially hostile situation, the
captain will place the lives of his crew above the fate of his ship. 

General Order 18 "Upon being accused of treason against the Federation,
Starfleet personnel may demand a trail conducted by the Federation
judiciary". If the individual is acquitted, Starfleet Command shall have
no further legal recourse against the accused in said matter. 

General Order 19 Except in times of declared emergency, Starfleet
personnel may under no circumstances convey personnel or material
between planets or planetary systems when there is reason to believe
that said personnel or material may be used to conduct aggression. This
order applies to independent worlds within the Federation as well as to
Federation members. 

General Order 20 Officers and personnel of Starfleet Command may employ
whatever means necessary to prevent the possession, transportation,
sale, or commercial exchange of sentient beings held against their
wishes within the boundaries of Federation space. 

General Order 21 No Starfleet personnel, either officer or enlisted, may
offer his services to an independent foreign government without the
express authorization of the Federation Assembly. 

General Order 22 As the rights of individual expression and free
discourse are considered sacred, Starfleet personnel may debate the
policies and decisions of their governmental representatives privately
at any time, to the extent that such discussions do not violate their
command oath or specific duties to the Federation per these General
Orders or Starfleet regulations. 

General Order 23 When verifiable proof is presented to the senior
commanding officer of a Starfleet vessel or post that a Federation
representative may currently be acting or have acted in the past to
violate the Prime Directive, the officer may relieve said representative
of office, then assume the full powers of that office pending a full
investigation by governmental officials. 

General Order 24 If a commanding officer deems that an individual or
group of individuals pose a threat to Starfleet personnel or Federation
civilians, he may take any action deemed necessary (including force) to
secure the safety of those threatened. 

General Order 25 Civilian and military personnel taken into custody by
Starfleet personnel during times of extreme emergency shall be accorded
proper treatment consistent with their rank or station, insofar as such
treatment does not compromise the security of the Federation or
Starfleet. 

General Order 26 No member of a ship's complement or other ground-based
installation can be held directly accountable for the actions of their
superiors. Similarly, no member of a ship's company or other Starfleet
personnel will share in disciplinary measures taken against the
commanding officer(s) if said individuals were not directly involved in
the actions leading to disciplinary measures. This order extends to
conditions involving proven violations of the Prime Directive, where
proof of such violations exist.

General Order 27 No member of Starfleet shall be required by the
assignment of standard duties and responsibilities to undergo extended
separation from his family, if family members can be reasonably provided
for aboard ship or as a part of an existing Starfleet installation. 

General Order 28 No officer of command rank shall be removed from
command status unless such action has the complete and unqualified
agreement of at least three senior officers present. Whenever possible,
such officers shall include the ship's First Officer, Chief Medical
Officer, Counselor, and one junior officer of command station. 

General Order 29 The primary responsibility of the commander of any
Starfleet vessel or installation is the welfare and safety of his crew,
including any civilian members. No action may be taken that creates an
unwarranted threat to the safety of those individuals under the
officer's charge, except in the line of duty and when otherwise
unavoidable. 

General Order 30 Starfleet Command recognizes the right of each ship
commander to interpret the specifications of the Prime Directive as he
sees fit, consistent with the conditions of other existing general
orders in effect, and based upon circumstances that may arise in dealing
with newly discovered sentient races. 

General Order 31 The conditions and specifications of the Prime
Directive shall henceforth apply to all sentient lifeforms discovered,
whether they are of natural or artificial origin. 

General Order 32 Except in the case of an extreme emergency, no
Starfleet commander is authorized to order his ship to travel faster
than Warp Factor Five without express permission from Starfleet Command.
   
  
Headquarters of The United Federation of Planets

Sector 001:Earth BACKGROUND Founded in 2161, the United Federation of
Planets is an alliance of approximately 150 planetary governments and
colonies, united for mutual trade, exploratory, scientific, cultural,
diplomatic, and defensive endeavors. The five founding parties are
Humans, Vulcans, Andorians, Orions, and .

The Federation is governed by a council of representatives from the
various member planets, that meet in the city of San Francisco, on
Earth.

Although the Federation and its Star Fleet have done an extraordinary
job of maintaining a generally peaceful climate in this region of the
galaxy, the Federation and its member planets have been involved in
number of armed conflicts over the years. Notable among these are the
tensions with the Klingon Empire, which lasted almost a century until
the Organian Peace Treaty, in 2267, and later the Khitomer Conference of
2293. Still unresolved are conflicts with the Romulan Star Empire, and
the Tholian Assembly.

The Federation was involved in a protracted, bitter war with Cardassia,
that dated back to the 2350s. An uneasy peace treaty with the Cardassian
Union was reached in 2366. Conflict with the Cardassians continued at a
lower level for years. In particular, the Federation took control of an
old cardassian mining station, Deep Space Nine, in the Bajoran System,
near the newly discovered Wormhole.

POLICY The United Federation of Planets was founded as a peaceful
collaboration of many planetary governments, dedicated to peaceful
acquisition of knowledge, technologies, and better living. The
Federation seeks out new civilizations, in hopes of establishing
peaceful contact, and developing a relationship which is prosperous to
both.

The most important policy of the Federation is the Prime Directive. The
Prime Directive communities that we must not, for any reason, interfere with
the natural development of a less advanced culture, and that we must
also not interfere with the internal affairs of any government outside
of the Federation.

The Federation accepts all offers of peace which are believed to be in
good faith. Treaties offered by any race, which are believed to be to
allow that race to reload and regroup before attacking are not accepted.

FEDERATION COUNCIL The Federation Council, along with the President,
deal with the political and economic issues such as negotiating
treaties, or the distribution of resources. To this end, there are some
ships that are not a part of Star Fleet, mainly transports, allowing
people and products to be transported efficiently. As the Federation is
a Representative Democracy, representatives from each of the member
planets make up the council. Each representative is elected by the
planetary government, and from them, the president is elected.

STARFLEET COMMAND Star Fleet Command is responsible for keeping ships
ready and able to work for the Federation's economic, scientific, and
defensive needs. They assign missions, and supply briefings, as well as
gather intelligence information. Normally, Command will decide what
needs to be done, and then assign a fleet commander or fleet captain to
the mission, who in turn assigns ships to specific areas of the mission.
Often, on research or exploratory missions, Star Fleet Command will
directly assign ships to explore certain sectors, as this is the
simplest, most efficient way of keeping track. In extreme emergencies,
Star Fleet Command and the Federation Council will meet, and assign
missions to each individual ship, and in some cases, to each individual
person.

Preamble to the Articles of the Federation We the intelligent life-forms
of the United Federation of Planets determined to save succeeding
generations from the scourge of intra-galactic war which has brought
untold horror and suffering to our planetary social systems, and 

to reaffirm faith in the fundamental intelligent life-form rights, in
the dignity and worth of the intelligent life-form person, to the equal
rights of male and female and of planetary social systems large and
small, and 

to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger
freedom, 

and to these ends to practice benevolent tolerance and live together in
peace with one another as good neighbors, and 

to unite our strength to maintain intra-galactic peace and security, and

to ensure by the acceptance of principles and the institution of methods
that armed force shall not be used except in the common defense, and
