"Business"

Scene: Arcadia
GMHD Headquarters

The occupants of the elevator took wing. The center  
of the flock drove onward toward his apartment as the drone of 
voices continued around him. A slim shadow walked with him.

"You have a 15 minute feather-soother with the Union Master at 1:00 and
a 30 minute groundbreaking at the new medical instruments division immediately 
afterward."

"Security has indicated that theft in the VR manufactury has spiked 
up beyond pre-war levels."

"Your masseusse has called in to cancel you 4:00 appointment."

"Your daughter's staff tutor has called to request a conference about her recent 
performance on the basic economics exams."

"The Senator has requested your presence at next week's fund-raising."

Two steps from the door his hand waved out to greet the sensors. The 
door slid open and most of the flock stopped at the edge. A brief nod 
to them all and he entered with his shadow behind them. The words "Lights up" 
froze on his lips as they rose to half intensity to reveal two men in skin-masks.

Dual coughs from their right hands reduced the shadow to a  
shaking bundle on the floor.

He noted the cut of their clothes as they moved within reach on each side.
The shorter of the two, on the left, spoke.

"Just one question. Where is your sister ?"

A flicker of amusement and suprise registered in his eyes. 

"Beyond your reach."

"No one is beyond our reach!"

The smile spread through his face.

"I think you would be very suprised to know how far beyond your reach she is."

A noise from behind him caused them to step back. 
The shadow stepped in front of him. A bright grin lit his 
face. 

"Wanna go for two falls of three ?"

The first needle caught one before he moved. The other 
caught his partner while turning to run. The shadow 
stepped forward as they fell. A quick twist of the clothing 
revealed the palm guns they each wore. The shadow patted 
them on the cheek.

"Idiots. Didn't you realize we make most of the 
police grade convulsants ?"

He turned toward his boss who was already tapping 
his e-com. His questioning look was answered in kind 
with a shrug and a brief: 

"I wonder what this is all about."
