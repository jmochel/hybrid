\chapter*{Kalifate Culture}

\section*{Locale}

The Kalifate culture spans from the northernmost seacoast of the 
Maldevar coast all the way down to the edge of the Tarmanian plains. 
It is an area similiar in climate and terrain to the southern coast of Spain.

\section*{Pocket Personality Sketch}

Your typical Kalifate is flamboyant in play and taciturn in 
work.  They are typically considered hot blooded, quick to 
anger, and quick to cool down.  A murder of passion is far more 
likely for a Kalifate then one that is calculated.  They enjoy 
beautiful music with a strong rhythm and tragic love stories.

\section*{Resources}

The Kalifate have a great bounty in both ocean based goods and
fruit of the land. They have ships and good wood for ship building. 
There are figs, olives, grapes, fish, lotus, myrrh, and hemp. 

There is cinnabar, amber, coal, limestone, marble, and basalt. 
There is ample iron ore. Horses seem to thrive.

\section*{Technology}

Steel and Bronze, simple dome ovens, heated baths, simple oil lamps, basic carts 
, wagons, and buggys. Horseshoes, stirrups, simple looms.

Medical technology is straight forward. A knowledge of bleeding, bandaging, cautery, 
and stitching is well spread but there is no knowledge of hygiene.

The weapon technology is advanced with breakfront crossbows, spears, 
rapiers, daggers, capes, and light lance.

\section*{Magic}

The high magics of wizardry are known as well as sorceries. Mages are 
tolerated but often viewed with suspicion. Priestly magic is 
trusted and encouraged. There are several magic cults based on the 
worship of the Lady in her maiden or hag modes.  These are viewed 
with some suspision.

\section*{Subsistence Patterns}

The Kalifate as a group are accustomed used to living in a 
fairly sparse environment. They tend to live in large estates
called {\it Estanzia}. Each estanzia has its own fields, gardens 
and its own stock. Some estanzia, notably those near the ocean, 
have so called fish pens that are fed by the tides. Hunting is 
common, especially for birds.
Children often do trapping and simple hunting.  
Fields tend to grow corn, grapes, and cotton.
Most Estanzia have 100-200 adults and some outlying homes. Most 
have some woods within an hours ride for hunting.
Many Estanzisa have trees planted in the center as well as a 
family "oasis".
Trade tends to travel in large gypsy and trader caravans.

\section*{Values and Kinship}

Personal bravery is valued as is good horsemanship. Killing an equal
opponent is considered a brave act, killing a lesser opponent is 
diminishing of the winners skill. Dueling is rarely to the death unless the 
opponent is equally skilled and there is no other recourse. More often
a fight is to the humiliation, not death.
Recklessness and Style are very important.
A truly brave and able opponent may be awarded with the table 
de' muerte.  
Don't say "Su Madre".
A noble woman is valued for her skill in riding, it is part of 
her dowry.

\section*{Language}

\subsection*{Language Tree}

The kalifate language is very similiar to spanish in flow and 
rythm.

\subsection*{Literacy}

Literacy is limited to priests, accountants, and the nobility.
All woman know how to read dance and musical notations.
Priests keep track of the history.

\section*{Religion,Myths,and History}

The Kalifate religion seems to be based on the Lord and the Lady
but with strong cult leanings for each. There are many little signs that
show the Kalifates leaning away from worship of the Lord and the Lady and
more toward a cult of worship of the Lady.

Religous observances are split among men and women.  Usually 
men go to temple early in the morning and women go later in the 
day.  

Worship of the Lord refers to him as our Lord patron in 
addition there is a strong following for one of the fourteen 
caldes who meet with the Lord who brought with them promises of 
land and saftey to the people.

--Names of the Caldes
--there should be a name for the Estanzia owned by descendants 
of the Caldes

There is also a third form of worship for the Steeds of the 
Lord and the Lady who are known as Rolan and Aphrodie.


There are a series of strictures layed down to the fourteen 
Caldes.  No blood should be spilled on a holy day, no set of 
single lovers shall be kept apart....

\section*{Tradition}

All women must be trained to ride and to shoot crossbows.


section*{Institutions}

Two thirds of Kalifate society is involved directly or 
indirectly with some sort of cult.  The cult may be something 
as innocous as a religous meeting group or as sinister as the 
El Tigre hunting club.  
Several other cults: there are two women only religous cults of 
which very little is known, one is known as the moon maidens 
and the other is called the Lady's Hand's.

Descent is reckoned through the female line.  So the children 
of the noble mothers and common fathers are born noble.  
Childern of noble fathers and commoner women are born one grade 
below that of the father.

\section*{Clergy}

The titles of Priests and Priestess are typically variations on 
the theme "reflected lights".
