Project Directory Structure

src	Java Source Files

classes Compiled .java files from the src/ 

bin     Using the java interpretor directly is not the best solution 
	for running a Java application. A user of the application 
	shouldn't need to know that this is a Java application, and 
	the approach for running Java application should be the same 
	as for all other applications.  The approach for making an 
	application from a Java executable class is to create a 
	wrapper script. 

html    Scratch directory for testing applets

jars    The jars/ directory contains all .jar archives in use. 
	This includes 3rd-party .jar files that should be copied 
	here manually, and produced .jar files that will be 
	put here automatically by make. It would be tempting to 
	divide between your own .jar files and 3-rd party ones, but 
	if you want to run your application through a .jar file 
	you've made, all .jar files must be located in the same 
	directory.

scm     Software Configuration Management - Makefiles, other source 
	maintainence scripts, source code generation templates etc...

docs    The docs/ directory should hold all output from the 
	javadoc documentation tool. The sub directory structure 
	is automatically created by javadoc and is similar 
	to the one in the src/ and classes/ directory. The 
	entry point for the HTML browser will be the file $\docs\index.html.
	
documents           Articles/Design Documents, etc.
documents\articles
documents\notes

models      Any modeling tool files
