Reply to:   RE>New ritual concept
First comment:  Either you've been programming to long or I have;  Your spell
looks like a subroutine.

Second comment:  As presented, I don't think that it is necessary to dedicate
it to a specific function in the beginning.   I also find it difficult to
connect a dance ritual with offensive magic (I can see a war dance to prepare
you for war but . . .).  If at all combat related I would say defence.
Otherwise I would say task oriented, ie. bring rain, make crops fertile, create
a gateway, move a node line, etc.

I like the idea about doing a dance and having the energy available later, but
I would present it differently (and maybe this is OK too but a different
ritual).  I would say that the act of dancing by one or more people summons
energy based on the individual and the amount of time danced.  And that this
energy can be gathered/focused/bound by one participant for use at that time or
later.  But if used later, I would say that the energy was bound to the spot
where the dance occured rather than projected forward in time to an unknown
spot or time or to a pattern that has only been conceived, not danced (since if
you actually dance the pattern, then you create multiple destination points
that the power could arrive at.

Alex, what happened with your group at the Geomancer's circle?

Yours Morphusly,

Chris

What do you have down for skills and time used for training with morphus,(if
anything)

Staff Warding:

Do you think that we could or should use either the wood of the staff or the
capstone of the staff for the battery?

I know from alex that the staff is constantly gathering mana, at least in it's
current unbound state.  do you think that we can take advantage of that?

Do you think that I could be Psi attacked through the staff?

So that I can better understand how this would work when completed, let me ask
you some questions.

If we cast this so that we have a battery of power X feeding a ward would the
ward have power based on the battery or would the battery just maintain the
existence of the ward?

Hi there Oh-Mighty GM,
        I have some thoughts for you on Mordanith's Up and Coming
rituals. Since we have not had time to discuss your latest thoughts on
permanent magic items I went ahead on the thoughts I had and came up with some
design ideas.

        First off:
        From a GMS standpoint I decided that what is needed for balance is
something that requires maintainence and is fairly slow to recharge.

        SO: Picture the following.

{SPELL BATT #1} -> {SPELL BATTERY MAINTAINENCE SPELL}
                             |
                             |
                    {SPELL BATTERY #2}
                             |
                             V
                    {THE WARD ITSELF}

Spell Battery #1 feeds the SpellBattMaintainSpell at a very low cost.
The SpellBattMaintainSpell does nothing more than recharge the
Spell Battery #2 whenever its energy starts to lower. The Spell
Battery #2 feeds a ward in one of the usual manners.

The SpellBattMaintainSpell has two features. One is to draw oin the
ambient power in the area, the other is to act as a direct recharge
from a spell caster.

This gives a good number of desirable traits in that
1) Once a ward has been used it will slowly recharge (subject to the
energies in Spell Bat #1.
2) It can be rechrged in a hurry if needed. Mordanith would of course
supply the the descripotion of the recharge spell. And of course, the guild
will love the possibility of maintainence contracts.

3) It is more complex and requires lots more spell workings.

4) It requires two spells to be researched: The maintainence
spell, and the SpellBattery #1, which must be able to last
a lot longer than normal spell batteries and would probably be limited
in some other way. It may simply only be able to be used at those
lower rates of draw.

Think about it and let me know.

Jim
OK Chris,

        New ritual concept. Alex says that it is sick but he likes it.

        First ritual :
                1) Summon up a great deal of power (100+ pts) and do a simple
                devotional dance.
                2) Focus on the next dance pattern you intend to do, and send
                the energy forward to that point in time.

        All subsequent rituals
                1) Summon up a great deal of power and do a slightly more complex
                devotional dance .
                2) Make explicit connection with the power you sent forward about
                last time and gather the energy to you.
                3) Focus on the next dance pattern and send the accumulated power forward.

        At the last ritual use the power for what it is designed.

        I am trying to decide whatheer or not I should use the energy offensively or
        defensively and whether I should dedicate it to specific action in the
        beginning or wait. Any ideas ?


        If its used offensively I think it should be named the "Time Hammer"

OK Alex,
	Here are my ritual design notes for the long life
        spell battery or DuraSpell II.

        First off:
        From a GMS standpoint I decided that what is needed for balance is
something that requires maintainence and is fairly slow to recharge.

        SO: Picture the following.

{SPELL BATT #2} -> {SPELL BATTERY MAINTAINENCE SPELL}
                             |
                             |
                    {SPELL BATTERY #1}
                             |
                             V
                    {THE WARD ITSELF}

Spell Battery #2 feeds the SpellBattMaintainSpell at a very low cost.
The SpellBattMaintainSpell does nothing more than recharge the
Spell Battery #1 whenever its energy starts to lower. The Spell
Battery #1 feeds a ward in one of the usual manners.

The SpellBattMaintainSpell has two features. One is to draw oin the
ambient power in the area, the other is to act as a direct recharge
from a spell caster.

SPELL ATTRIBUTES : OVERALL

DIFFICULTY FACTOR -65
MINIMUM CAST TIME 2hr+.5hr/50 power in batt 1
MINIMUM POWER COST 10 + (Amount of power to stored)
DURATION Governed by power supply rate and ambient mana level
RANGE  0
AREA OF EFFECT One object

PREPARATION

This ritual requires a physical storage reservoir such as a block of
crystal, ivory, or wood, that has had one special rune of inscribed in
it as well as a power binding performed on it.

The more highly ordered the internal structure of the object is the
better it is as a material component. IN other words I should get
plusses for crystal of various types. Diamonds should be the best.


GENERAL NOTES

The whole spell should be one complex rune.
Some sort of divinational white noise should be part of the
rune so that it becomes impossible for your average magic trained thief
to figure out what it does and very hard for a good mage to figure it
out.

Batt #2 must be rechargeable by a random mage who has been taught
how to do so.

The discharge rate I suggest for Batt #2 is 1 point for for each (Draw)
points it recharges the Batt #1.

Batt #2 cannot be drained in the normal manner for spell batteries but
Batt #1 can.


RESEARCH NOTES

Note that I do have a "nearly complete description of the Energy
Damp Ward that absorbs mana from before the Purge by Dazara."

That plus the Linking Ward studies I have done should help me a lot.
