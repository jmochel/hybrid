  <history>
   <para>A Dissenta captain guarding a Preceptor during the Battle for the Wizard King's citadel
    he was injured during Aurioch's preceptor cleanup after the battle. His preceptor blew
    up and almost took Jesu with him. When he regained conciousness he was aware of both a pain
    in his leg and Aurioch standing above him. What passed between he and Aurioch at that point
    is only known to them and one of Aurioch's paladins but the end result was that Aurioch
    appears to have withheld judgement.</para>
   <para>Since then Jesu has traveled from the site of the battle to Marden where he spent his time
    waiting, drinking, and seeking out scholars who have the time to talk of choice and judgement
    and ethics.
