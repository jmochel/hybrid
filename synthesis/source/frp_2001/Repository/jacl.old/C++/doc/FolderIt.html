The class <TT>dir_it</TT> is an STL conformant input iterator which
iterates over the entries of a directory. It is modelled very much
along the standard <TT>istream_iterator</TT> class: To iterate over the
complete directory, a begin iterator is created with the directory's
name and a "past the end" iterator is created with the default
constructor of class <TT>dir_it</TT>. Then, the begin iterator yields a
<TT>string</TT> with the name of the current directory entry. The begin
iterator (or a copy thereof) can be advanced until either the whole
directory was scanned or an error occured: In both cases the iterator
object used to advance compares equal to the "past the end"
iterator. Note that the initial begin iterator will also compare equal
to the "past the end" iterator if opening the directory failed for
some reason.

<P>


Like the <TT>istream_iterator</TT>, the class <TT>dir_it</TT> is a one
pass iterator over the directory: Copying an iterator is legal but
advancing both resulting iterators will bring them out of sync. Also
the original and the copy will iterate over different elements of the
directory. The same holds for assignment.  However, both the copy and
the left hand side of the assignment store the same value of the right
hand side and may be used to compare against other <TT>dir_it</TT>s: Two
<TT>dir_it</TT>s are considered to be equal if they are either equal to
the "past the end" iterator (effectively indicating that either the
whole directory was travered or an error occured) or if both iterators
yield the same name with the dereference operator. Note that in the
latter case the iterators may actually be positioned on different
files if they are obtained from iterators created for different
directories.
  
  <A NAME="Example"><H1>Example</H1></A>


Here is an example how the class <TT>dir_it</TT> can be used to produce
an output similar to the output of "<TT>ls -1fa .</TT>":

    <PRE>
  #include "directory.h"
  #include &lt;algorithm&gt;
  #include &lt;iostream.h&gt;

  int main()
  {
    dir_it begin("."), end;
    copy(begin, end, ostream_iterator&lt;string&gt;(cout, "\n"));
    return 0;
  }
    </PRE>

<P>


This code compiles with gcc-2.7.2 and libg++-2.7.2 (provided that the
header file "directory.h" is stored somewhere where it is found by
the compiler; use a -I argument to the compiler invokation if
necessary). However, it is not strictly conforming to the prospective
ISO C++ standard (e.g. there is a <TT>using namespace std;</TT> clause
missing).

  
  <A NAME="Possible Enhancements"><H1>Possible Enhancements</H1></A>


There is a big potentatial to add enhancements to this class. For
example, a wrapper could be implemented to skip certain names like
e.g. the "." and ".." entries. Such a class would be rather
straight forward to implement and could be useful for other input
iterators, too, if it takes a predicate as argument to determine which
items should be skipped. A more interesting extension would be a
wrapper which provides access to the file properties of the current
name, e.g. by using the <TT>stat()</TT> family of functions from the
POSIX system interface.
