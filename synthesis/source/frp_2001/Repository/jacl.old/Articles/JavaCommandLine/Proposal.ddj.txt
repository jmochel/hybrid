A Configurable Command Line Parser 
----------------------------------------

Abstract
--------
Java's reflection API provides the programmer with some clean solutions 
to logically simple problems that may not implement well in languages
like C++. Most of those problems have to do with run-time configuration 
or extensibility.

The article presents a set of simple Java classes that provides an 
configurable command line parser that can adopt different command line
syntaxes without prior knowledge of the syntax.

In effect the user can chose between 

program /in=schmoo.jpg /verbose=true 

and 

program -in schmoo.jpg -verbose

and even a currently unknown syntax by changing 
a system property.

Outline
-------

Goals and requirements

    Simple
    Separate syntax from semantics
    Run-time configurable for Syntax
    Generates usage notes on the fly from the tag/value description.


The Design (Key points)
-----------------------
    
    Lexer handles syntax and errors relating to syntax

    Parser handles semantics and errors relating to semantics

    Lexer as a Enumerator

    Parser uses reflection API to instantiate the desired Lexer

    Using the string constructor the Parser can return the correctly instantiated 
    argument value without knowing anything about its type.

	i.e. /in=shmoo.jpg is described as a java.io.File and asking for the value of "in"
	returns a File object (or an exception that says it couldn't create it !)
    
    When unable to parse the command line the Parser uses the 
    argument descriptions to generate a usage output.


The Implementation
------------------

    Lexer has one method that breaks the command line arguments down into key/value pairs:

	    public abstract void lex(String[] argValues) throws IllegalArgumentException;

    Parser has:

	A constructor that takes the name of the Lexer class to use (or uses a system property)

	    public Parser(String lexerClassName, boolean exitOnFailure) throws LexerCreationException

	A method for describing the arguments expected on the command line.

	    public void register(ArgSemantic argSemantic) 

		(looks something like this in action:
			
			register(new Parser.ArgSemantic("in", "Input file name", "java.io.File", true));
		)

	And a method to invoke the actual parsing
    
	    public void parse(String[] args)



Other Notes
-----------

Having implemented similiar schemes in C++ (and even C) I can't 
put enugh stress on how much cleaner this is for day-to-day work. 
Using it usually consists of creating a specialised Parser class 
that describes the arguments in the constructor, add a few 
accessors for them and go !

Its only real limitation is that to use a class as a parameter 
return value it must have a constructor that takes a java.lang.String.
Not really a great sacrifice.


Thanks and let me know if you are interested.
