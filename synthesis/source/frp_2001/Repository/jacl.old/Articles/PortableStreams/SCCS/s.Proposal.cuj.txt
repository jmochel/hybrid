A Portable Memory Mapped File API in C++
----------------------------------------

Abstract
--------
With the recent changes in computer hardware and operating systems
it is not easy to predict what will cause an I/O bottleneck. In some 
cases removing a little buffer copying will drastically improve 
performance. On many operating systems an application can use memory mapped 
file I/O to do this. The trick is in doing it portably. 

The article presents a C++ class that provides a portable API for using 
memory mapped files on Win32 and Linux. The code uses the Standard C++ library 
including STL container classes and exceptions. 

Outline
-------

Intro

    Underlying RAM/Disk/Bus speed and size relationships have changed 
    drastically in the last ten years. 

    Increasing main memory and caches sizes combined with higher CPU and main memory speeds 
    can make buffer copying an actual bottleneck.

    Memory Mapping is one possible answer

Goals and requirements

    Portable
    AFAP (As Fast As Possible)
    Allow for later expansion to sockets and named pipes.

The Design

    Mention the specific design patterns used with references 
    
The API

    Straighforward and quick discussion on why certain API choices were
    made.

The Implementation

    Notes on initialization functions used
    Notes on STL gotchas I encountered

Results

    Notes on why most profilers are a major pain for this sort of thing
    Profiling results



Background
----------
After getting a Chemistry degree at Worcester Polytechnic Institute I promptly became
a C and Assembly language programmer. I am working now for Foliage
Software Systems, a very sharp contract house. I have worked in the past
doing GUI Toolkit work as well as information retrieval systems.


Other Notes
-----------

I have finished the Win32 portion of the implementation
and I will be tackling the Linux version this coming week. Assuming the
usual nightmarish porting issues with GCC I expect that I could start
writing the article in two weeks.

This is the start of (I hope) a susbtantial information retrieval toolkit.

Thanks and let me know if you are interested.
