For compiling with the Pure C compiler on the Atari ST, you must compile
and install the packages in the order 'libtmc', 'tm', 'tmc'.  See the
README files in each of the directories. Note that as of version 1.2,
the Atari ST version is no longer supported (I have sold my ST).
For compiling with the Borland C++ compiler under MSDOS/MS-Windows, you must
compile and install the packages in the order 'libtmc', 'tm', 'tmc'.
See the README files in each of the directories.
