    <title>The History of the Confederation</title>
    <chapter>
        <title>Brief Description</title>
        <para>
        The Confederation of Systems, more commonly known as the 
        Confederation or Confed, is a collection of solar systems and colonies banded 
        together for both defense and trade. There has been a concerted 
        effort by the Confed to limit interference in the internal workings of the 
        actual systems.

        The Confed emcompasses a number of major racial groups. The Terrans 
        and the various derivative races of {\it Homo Terra Prime} 
        constitute a major portion of the current population. The Alpha 
        Centaurans and the derivative races of {\it Homo Alpha Centauran 
        Prime} constitute the next largest group followed closely by the 
        Proximans {\it Homo Proxima Prime}. There are no other known races 
        currently members of the Confed.

        The duties of the Confederation as a governing body are quite simple: 
        keep the peace {\em Between member systems}. To this end each system 
        donates a portion of its military services to the Confed as well as 
        some monetary support.

        <title>History</title>
        <para>
        The history of the Confederation is most properly the history of the 
        Terrans. The Terrans were one of the primary forces behind the 
        formation of the Confederation. 

        The Terran History of the years immediately preceeding the year 2530 is
        found to have a nearly hysterical flavour to those used to reading the
        histories of less divided cultures. Most other cultures in the 
        Confederation of Systems have a sharply defined predilection toward or
        away from war. Few cultures have the ambivalence of a Terran towards
        violence.

        During the time period following the Second World War the world focused
        in conflicts around the two main super powers of the time period. With
        a strong technological lead over the Soviet Bloc, the USA spent a great
        deal of energy and influence in combatting any gains made by the Soviet
        Bloc. 
        </para>

        <para>
        During this time period there was a gradual decline in the health of
        the economies of the two Blocs as well as in actual scientific rather
        than technological knowledge growth. In addition there was a marked
        increase in religous fundamentalism in both the US and abroad in
        various Islamic and Hindu countries. Both of the superpowers of the 
        time period tended to ignore the economic build up of other countries 
        except when their own immediate well being seem threatened. Certainly 
        , both countries had a great deal to worry about.
        </para>

        <para>
        As the technological wonders mounted in number and variety, so did the
        need for energy to grow and expand. Conventional sources proved
        insufficient and standard nuclear methods proved to be to dangerous.
        During this time period public confidence in conventional
        power sources was on the decline. 
        </para>

        <para>
        The stresses placed on some of the smaller countries by the three ``super powers''
        (EEC,Soviet Union, USA) caused many of the countries to form serious coalitions
        with similiarly inclined republics. Thus came into being the United Islamic States,
        sthe Indos Island States (Phillipines and Indonesia), and the loosley allied 
        Scandinavian Coalition (the Scandic).
        </para>

        <para>
        Multinational Corporations became commonplace as each country's industrial 
        complex bought into the financial structure of several others. Space travel 
        was almost an ignored project with only small bits of developement going on 
        at a relatively low intensity . 
        </para>

        <para>
        Other methods of energy production became standard. With the 
        discovery of a highly efficient technique for solar energy conversion 
        came an increased traffic flow between the planet and its moon.
        </para>

        <para>
        The smaller countries begin to use the U.N. as a fairly sophisticated 
        lever against both of the two super powers. The EEC, Israel, the 
        Islamic state coalition, and the republic of India are primary 
        supporters. in doing so they establish a fairly strong tradition for 
        the U.N. as a military force and the use of Israeli Officers as advisors. 
        </para>

        <para>

        wills his fortune, his entire stock holding in Jackl Power (74\%) , 
        and his land holdings in upper New York State to the Mohawk Nation of 
        Quebec. The Mohawk Nation uses the money to finance the building of 
        the ``Red Jacket University of Power Engineering ''. In addition, 
        they begin one of the largest public relations campaigns in history 
        as part of an attempt to separate from the NorAm combine.
