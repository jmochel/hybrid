            \chapter{Marshalls}

            \section{Description}

            The Confederation Marshalls were established in the year 325 (CONFED) 
            as a civilian enforcement arm of the Confederation Council by 
            Confederation Governance Action 172-01/325 at the request of 
            Ex-Council Factor Dan Forest-Kell(Terra). Its duties are fairly 
            simply stated: To act as direct representatives of the Confederation 
            in any matter involving the enforcement of Confederation laws on a
            scale smaller than a full scale military action without regard to 
            planetary or spatial boundaries.  

            The Confederation Marshalls are direct representatives of the 
            Confederation Council and as such can request military action or 
            complete quarantine of a solar system. They are used as guards in 
            situations where military personell are not needed or are 
            undesirable.

            They are often involved in criminal investigation where a local 
            investigation would be the subject of some discomfort.

            The Marshalls have little or no access to spacecraft. They typically 
            use military craft or commercial transport, on which they travel at 
            no cost. In addition they are usually able to get access to most 
            government computer systems (within reason ) .

            \section{Regulations}

            Confederation Marshalls on duty are expected to be armed at all times 
            and to carry their ID with them at all times. While there is no 
            standard armament, there is a strong push for the rokie to train and 
            use a slug weapon. The reason seems to lie in the Terran wild west 
            origins of the Marshall concept. 

            \section{Ranks}

            Ranks are very simple. ( Two points of status are required for each rank )

            \begin{tabular}{||l|l||}
            provo	 & A rooky - typically assigned to a senior Marshall. \\
            4th Star & Attached to a specific region or beat   \\
            3rd Star & Attached to a specific duty area \\
            2nd Star & Semi Attached - Qualified for Council Level diplomatique missions \\
            1st Star & Unattached - Direct council representative. Picks his beat and reports in as necessary. \\
            \end{tabular}

            Unattached Marshalls have almost no salary. All of their normal 
            expenses on duty are paid simply by their ID card. Charges accrue to 
            the Confed  Council. They may commander equipment as necessary.

            \chapter{Confederation Mechanised Infantry}

            \section{Description}

            The Mechanized Infantry is one the primary reasons for the continued 
            existence of the Confederation in these troubled times. They 
            constitute a package of deadly force on a highly mobile platform with 
            the ability to perform everything from full scale assualts and 
            armoured support to pinpoint actions in densely populated civilian 
            areas.

            In the MI, there are no armchair officers. When the time to do some
            ground pounding comes around the officers are right there with their 
            men. An officer in many respects is a very skilled individual simply 
            because he must be able to direct the action and defend himself at 
            the same time. 

            The chain of command is painfully simple. 

            \begin{verbatim}
            The Commander General ( Marion Sutaken )
                   |
            	   V	
            Legion						1,011,101	
            	Battalion Commander
            	100 Jump Battalions   

            Jump Battalion				10,111
            	Division Commander           
                10 Jump Divisions      

            Jump Division               1,011 
            	Field Commander
            	10 Jump Plexes	      

            Jump Plex					101
            	Sargent Commander         
                10 Jump Squads		    

            Jump Squad or Hand			10 
            	1 Sargent                
                9 Infantryman       	 
            \end{verbatim}

            A simple schema but fairly effective. 

            The MI have a need for men or women that are tough, flexible and 
            capable of learning. As a result they have raided jails for potential 
            troopers as well as normal recruiting. If an confed citizen can pass 
            the examinations and initial training then he has a clean record. Any 
            criminal record possessed up to that point is eradicated. By the same 
            token the MI has a far more stringent set of laws and codes with 
            fairly harsh penalties. 

            All troopers enter a two year training program. This boot camp 
            process is expensive but effective. They are exposed to a wide range 
            of technological skills and are given Bacterial Augmentation 
            injections to improve response speed. 

            The MI get their name from the powered battle suits which they use almost
            to the exclusion of all other equipment.
