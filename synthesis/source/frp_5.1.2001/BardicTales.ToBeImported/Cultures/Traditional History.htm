<h4><center><a NAME="Hagakure"></a>The <i>Hagakure: The Book of the
Samurai</i></center></h4>

<p><b>Background Information</b></p>

<p>After the unification of Japan in 1590 and the establishment of
the Tokugawa Shogunate in 1600, the samurai (warriors) remained at
the top of the social scale but had fewer and fewer chances to prove
their valor in battle. As opportunities to fight decreased, and
samurai were employed in peacetime government positions, more
attention was given to the values that defined their class. One of
the most important was the loyalty samurai owed to the lord they
served. In fact, the word <i>samurai</i> itself comes from a verb
that means &quot;to serve.&quot;<br>

<br>

The lord or other high-ranking members of a clan often wrote out
codes of behavior for the clan retainers. Among them, a work called
<i>Hagakure</i>, or &quot;hidden leaves,&quot; has come to be seen as the one
which best describes <i>Bushidç</i>, the &quot;way of the samurai.&quot;
It was written down in the early eighteenth century by a young
samurai named Tashirç Tsuramoto, who was recording the wisdom
he had learned over seven years of talks with an older, retired
samurai of the Nabeshima clan named Yamamoto Tsunetomo. His ideas
were expressed in conversations with his young disciple and so the
resulting book is not a systematic code of rules. But some ideas are
repeated often enough to be seen as essential to his thought. The
selections below are grouped by theme.</p>

<p><center><u>
<hr>
</u></center></p>

<p><b>Death</b>: The Way of the Samurai is found in death. When it
comes to either/or, there is only the quick choice of death. It is
not particularly difficult. Be determined and advance. To say that
dying without reaching one's aim is to die a dog's death is the
frivolous way of sophisticates. When pressed with the choice of life
or death, it is not necessary to gain one's aim.<br>

<br>

We all want to live. And in large part we make our logic according to
what we like. But not having attained our aim and continuing to live
is cowardice. This is a thin dangerous line. To die without gaining
one's aim is a dog's death and fanaticism. But there is no shame in
this. This is the substance of the Way of the Samurai. If by setting
ones heart right every morning and evening, one is able to live as
though his body were already dead, he gains freedom in the Way. His
whole life will be without blame, and he will succeed in his
calling.<br>

</p>

<p><b>Living in the present</b>: There is surely nothing other than
the single purpose of the present moment. A man's whole life is a
succession of moment after moment. If one fully understands the
present moment, there will be nothing else to do, and nothing else to
pursue. Live being true to the single purpose of the moment.</p>

<p>Everyone lets the present moment slip by, then looks for it as
though he thought it were somewhere else. No one seems to notice this
fact. But grasping this firmly, one must pile experience upon
experience. And once one has come to this understanding he will be a
different person from that point on, though he may not always bear it
in mind.</p>

<p>When one understands this settling into single-mindedness well,
his affairs will thin out. Loyalty is also contained within this
single-mindedness.</p>

<p>Meditation on inevitable death should be performed daily. Every
day when one's body and mind are at peace, one should meditate upon
being ripped apart by arrows, rifles, spears and swords, being
carried away by surging waves, being thrown into the midst of a great
fire, being struck by lightning, being shaken to death by a great
earthquake, falling from thousand-foot cliffs, dying of disease or
committing<i> seppuku</i> (ritual suicide) at the death of one's
master. And every day without fail one should consider himself as
dead.</p>

<p>There is a saying of the elders that goes, &quot;Step from under the
eaves and you're a dead man. Leave the gate and the enemy is
waiting.&quot; This is not a matter of being careful. It is to consider
oneself as dead beforehand.<br>

</p>

<p><b>A good retainer</b>: Nakano Jin'emon constantly said, &quot;A person
who serves when treated kindly by the master is not a retainer. But
one who serves when the master is being heartless and unreasonable is
a retainer. You should understand this principle well.&quot;</p>

<p>When Hotta Kaga no kami Masamori was a page to the shçgun,
he was so headstrong that the shçgun wished to test what was at
the bottom of his heart. To do this, the shçgun heated a pair
of tongs and placed them in the hearth. Masamori's custom was to go
to the other side of the hearth, take the tongs, and greet the
master. This time, when he unsuspectingly picked up the tongs, his
hands were immediately burned. As he did obeisance in his usual
manner, however, the shçgun quickly got up and took the tongs
from him.</p>

<p>A man is a good retainer to the extent that he earnestly places
importance in his master. This is the highest sort of retainer. If
one is born into a prominent family that goes back for generations,
it is sufficient to deeply consider the matter of obligation to one's
ancestors, to lay down one's body and mind, and to earnestly esteem
ones master. It is further good fortune if, more than this, one had
wisdom and talent and can use them appropriately. But even a person
who is good for nothing and exceedingly clumsy will be a reliable
retainer if only he has the determination to think earnestly of his
master. Having only wisdom and talent is the lowest tier of
usefulness.</p>

<p>A certain general said, &quot;For soldiers other than officers, if they
would test their armor, they should test only the front. Furthermore,
while ornamentation on armor is unnecessary, one should be very
careful about the appearance of his helmet. It is something that
accompanies his head to the enemy's camp.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Speaking</b>: At times of great trouble or disaster, one word
will suffice. At times of happiness, too, one word will be enough.
And when meeting or talking with others, one word will do. One should
think well and then speak. This is clear and firm, and one should
learn it with no doubts. It is a matter of pouring forth one's whole
effort and having the correct attitude previously. This is very
difficult to explain but is something that everyone should work on in
his heart. If a person has not learned this in his heart, it is not
likely that he will understand it.</p>

<p>The essentials of speaking are in not speaking at all. If you
think that you can finish something without speaking, finish it
without saying a single word. If there is something that cannot be
accomplished without speaking, one should speak with few words, in a
way that will accord well with reason.</p>

<p>To open ones mouth indiscriminately brings shame, and there are
many times when people will turn their backs on such a person.</p>

<p><b>The Teachings of Yamamoto Jin'emon</b></p>

<p>These are the teachings of Yamamoto Jin'emon:</p>

<p>Singlemindedness is all-powerful.</p>

<p>Tether even a roasted chicken.</p>

<p>Continue to spur a running horse.</p>

<p>A man who will criticize you openly carries no connivance.</p>

<p>A man exists for a generation, but his name lasts to the end of
time.</p>

<p>Money is a thing that will be there when asked for. A good man is
not so easily found.</p>

<p>Walk with a real man one hundred years and he'll tell you at least
seven lies.</p>

<p>To ask when you already know is politeness. To ask when you don't
know is the rule.</p>

<p>Wrap your intentions in needles of pine.</p>

<p>One should not open his mouth wide or yawn in front of another.
</p>

<p>Do this behind your fan or sleeve.</p>

<p>A straw hat or helmet should be worn tilted toward the front.</p>

<h3><center>Discussion Questions</center></h3>

<p>1. What did it mean to a samurai to live as though already dead?
How does it relate to &quot;being true to the single purpose of the
moment&quot;? How would it help make a man brave? loyal?</p>

<p>2. How does this samurai attitude toward death compare to the
Buddhist doctrine of nonattachment? (see unit on
&quot;<a HREF="../religion/origins.htm">The Origins of Buddhism</a>&quot; in
the <b>Religion</b> section of the workbook.) How do the ultimate
goals of the two ways of thinking differ?</p>

<p>3. Why is &quot;a person who serves when treated kindly by the master
not a retainer&quot;? What does this attitude tell you about the value of
loyalty as practiced by a retainer? As received by a master? How does
the story of Hotta Masamori illustrate this? Why are wisdom and
talent the &quot;lowest tier of usefulness&quot;?</p>

<p>4. Why should soldiers test only the front of their armor? Why
does it matter how the helmet looks when a dead warrior's head is
brought back to the enemy's camp?</p>

<p>5. Does the emphasis on speaking seldom and using few words relate
to the attitude toward death? Toward singlemindedness?</p>

<p>6. How is shame experienced? What connection does it have to
loyalty?</p>

<p>7. How do you explain the inclusion of matters of etiquette (&quot;One
should not open his mouth wide . . . etc.&quot;) in the way of the
samurai? Similarly, how would you explain the inclusion of matters of
dress?</p>

<h3><center><b><i><a NAME="47 essay"></a></i></b>The Tale of the 47
Rçnin: An essay</center></h3>

<p><b><i>TO THE TEACHER: </i></b> This section contains an essay
about &quot;The Tale of the 47 Rçnin.&quot; You may also wish students to
read or dramatize the play <i><u>Chˆshingura: The Treasury of
Loyal Retainers</u></i>, which was written in 1748 for puppet theater
based on the historical event. This version of this story has
influenced all later retellings. The play is available, as translated
by Donald Keene, from Columbia University Press, 136 South Broadway,
Irvington, NY, 10533</p>

<p><center><b>&nbsp;</b></center></p>

<p><b>The Historical Event</b></p>

<p>During the stillness of the night of January 30, 1703, forty-six
masterless samurai (<i>rçnin</i>) burst into the Edo mansion of
a government official, Lord Kira, killed him, and took his head to
the grave of their former master Lord Asano in proof that they had
avenged his death. Lord Kira had, nearly two years earlier, goaded
their young Lord Asano into misbehavior for which he had been
condemned to die. His loyal former retainers secretly plotted and
finally successfully executed their revenge. As a mark of respect for
their loyalty, the government allowed the
<i>rçnin</i>--sentenced to death for the killing--to commit
suicide rather than submit to execution.</p>

<p><br>

<b>The Significance<br>

</b><br>

In the Tokugawa period (1600-1868), samurai ideals were refined and
codified even as the warriors no longer had cause to do battle. The
ideal of selfless commitment, even the glorification of dying to
express ones honor as a samurai, served as a mark of class as much as
the swords that only samurai could wear.<br>

<br>

In a rigidly structured class society, each class (samurai, peasants,
merchants, artisans) had its own particular standards and values. For
a member of a class that defined its worth by ideals of loyalty and
service, to be masterless was to be in a kind of limbo.
<i>Rçnin </i>were samurai who had fallen from a high social
position to a place outside the social scale entirely. Most often men
became <i>rçnin</i> because of defeat in battle, dereliction of
duty, or because their masters suffered some disgrace. By contrast,
in the American tradition of romanticizing outlaws, independence of
spirit is idealized rather than specific loyalties, and to be
unconnected to a respected position in society does not invariably
imply disgrace.</p>

<p>The motives and actions of the <i>rçnin</i>, however,
reflect ideals of Tokugawa society with which modern Japanese still
have sympathy. Contemporary Japanese still value loyalty highly and
identify closely with the groups to which they belong. For example, a
businessman will introduce himself by saying his company's name
before his own; the ties a student forms with his classmates in a
school or university last throughout his career. A reading of the
play will provide not only its own drama (and melodrama), but many
examples of the ideal of loyalty and devotion to something outside
oneself that account for the continuing popularity of the story.</p>

<p><b>Plot Summary and Analysis of <i>Chˆshingura: The Treasury
of Loyal Retainers</i></b></p>

<p>The version of the story that has influenced all later retellings
was a play written in 1748 for the puppet theater:
<i>Chˆshingura: The Treasury of Loyal Retainers.</i> Its main
plot is based on the 1703 incident, but it is set in 1338 in order to
avoid government censorship. Lord Asano becomes Lord Enya, and Kira
is called Kç no Moronao. Various subplots are added, and we see
the <i>rçnin</i> in all aspects of life--in love and in
conflict as well as in conspiracy.<br>

<br>

In one subplot, the leader of the conspiracy, Yuranosuke, pretends to
have sunk into chronic drunkenness. He flirts with Okaru, who was
sold into prostitution so that her husband, Kampei, could join the
conspiracy. Kampei proves his worthiness only as he dies, and becomes
the forty-seventh member of the conspiracy posthumously. In another
subplot,Yuranosuke's son Rikiya refuses to marry the woman he loves
knowing he will soon die, although he cannot reveal his reason. Her
father, who has acted prudently and without a true samurai disregard
of death, restores his own honor by serving the conspirators and by
finally dying well. These acts reunite his daughter with her love, if
only for a night. There are more subplots as well as additions in
later versions.<br>

<br>

Involved as the <i>rçnin</i> were over the many months between
the death of their lord and their act of revenge with finding means
to live (since <i>rçnin</i> lost their livelihoods when
dismissed from service), with loves, greed and generosity, secrecy
and fellowship, they were committed to this final act that they all
knew would end in their own deaths. So while the emotions the people
in the play <i>Chˆshingura</i> feel--the love between parents
and children, or husband and wife--are universal, they are expressed
very differently, are directed toward different ends, and expressed
in different actions. The story provides many examples of the classic
tension the Japanese see existing between <i>giri </i>(duty) and
<i>ninjç </i>(human feeling), a tension that should always be
resolved in favor of giri.*<br>

________________________________<br>

* Note that the character who fails to make this commitment to duty
is dropped from the group, and only regains his honor through a very
complicated process after his death.</p>

<h3><center>Questions for Discussion</center></h3>

<p>1. A <i>rçnin</i> was a samurai with no master, and had
something of the image of an outlaw or bandit in the American West.
The word samurai itself came from a word meaning &quot;to serve.&quot; How do
you think it felt to be a samurai, but to have no master? How do you
think you would be viewed by the rest of society?<br>

<br>

2. Today, a student who fails the entrance exam to a particular
college, and takes a year off after high school to study in order to
take the exam again, is called a <i>rçnin</i>. What does such a
student have in common with a <i>rçnin</i> of premodern
times?<br>

<br>

3. Why was it a mark of respect for the government to allow the
<i>rçnin</i> to commit suicide rather than be executed?<br>

<br>

4. The suicide ritual was called <i>seppuku</i>--what we sometimes
call <i>hara-kiri</i>, or &quot;stomach cutting--and required the warrior
to slit open his own belly with a knife. A second person, or
assistant, would then end his pain by swiftly decapitating him with a
sword. Why was ritual suicide performed in such a painful way? What
does all this tell about samurai values?<br>

<br>

5. What values in contemporary, postindustrial Japan would account
for the continued popularity of this story? What values in our own
society have made figures such as Jesse James or Robin Hood popular
heroes? How do the values of the two modern societies compare in
these heroes?<br>

<h3><center><u><a NAME="47 hagakure"></a></u>The Story of the
Forty-Seven Rçnin according to the <i>Hagakure </i><font SIZE="-2"><a HREF="bushido.htm#note">(1)</a></font></center></h3>

<p>A certain person was brought to shame because he did not take
revenge. The way of revenge lies in simply forcing ones way into a
place and being cut down. There is no shame in this. By thinking that
you must complete the job you will run out of time. By considering
things like how many men the enemy has, time piles up; in the end you
will give up.</p>

<p>No matter if the enemy has thousands of men, there is fulfillment
in simply standing them off and being determined to cut them all
down, starting from one end. You will finish the greater part of it.
</p>

<p>Concerning the night assault of Lord Asano's <i>rçnin</i>,
the fact that they did not commit <i>seppuku</i> at the Sengakuji was
an error, for there was a long delay between the time their lord was
struck down and the time when they struck down the enemy. If Lord
Kira had died of illness within that period, it would have been
extremely regrettable. Because the men of the Kamigata area have a
very clever sort of wisdom, they do well at praiseworthy acts but
cannot do things indiscriminately, as was done in the Nagasaki
fight.<font SIZE="-2"><a HREF="bushido.htm#2">(2)</a></font></p>

<p>Although all things are not to be judged in this manner, I mention
it in the investigation of the Way of the Samurai. When the time
comes, there is no moment for reasoning. And if you have not done
your inquiring beforehand, there is most often shame. Reading books
and listening to people's talk are for the purpose of prior
resolution.<br>

</p>

<p>Above all, the Way of the Samurai should be in being aware that
you do not know what is going to happen next, and in querying every
item day and night. Victory and defeat are matters of the temporary
force of circumstances. The way of avoiding shame is different. It is
simply in death.</p>

<p>Even if it seems certain that you will lose, retaliate. Neither
wisdom nor technique has a place in this. A real man does not think
of victory or defeat. He plunges recklessly towards an irrational
death. By doing this, you will awaken from your dreams.<br>
