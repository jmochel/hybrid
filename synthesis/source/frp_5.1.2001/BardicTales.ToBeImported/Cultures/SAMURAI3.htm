<BR><B><FONT FACE="WP MathA"><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;THE WAY OF THE SAMUARI</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>&nbsp;</FONT> A samurai was the hereditary&nbsp; warrior
class in feudal Japan.&nbsp; The term originally referred only to the imperial
guards. After the coming of the feudal system, it meant the entire military
class.&nbsp; This included the samurai warriors, the feudal lords called
daimyos, and the <A HREF="http://www.wcslc.edu/pers_pages/bhb1722/Shogun_.htm">shogun</A>.&nbsp;
About 5 of every 100 Japanese belonged to this group.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A code of unquestioning obedience and loyalty, called Bushido, bound the
Samurai warriors&nbsp; to their lords.&nbsp; The Samurai prized honor above
wealth of life and atoned for dishonor by committing&nbsp; <A HREF="http://www.wcslc.edu/pers_pages/bhb1722/Harakiri.htm">hara-kiri</A>,
or ceremonial suicide.&nbsp; They wore two swords and a distinctive headdress.&nbsp;
The Samurai were graded in military ranks, each with an appropriate income
in rice. They lost their privileges when the Japanese abolished feudalism
in 1871.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
One who is a Samurai must before all things keep constantly in mind, by
day and night,
<BR>from the morning when he takes up his chopsticks to eat his New Year's
breakfast to Old Year's
<BR>night when he pays his yearly bills, the fact that he has to die.&nbsp;&nbsp;
If he is mindful of this, he will be able to
<BR>live in accordance with the paths of Loyalty and Filial Duty, will
avoid myriad's of evil and adversities,
<BR>keep himself free from disease and calamity and more over enjoy a long
life.&nbsp; I am afraid that in this
<BR>paper I only scratch the surface, I can only relate the information
and ask you to discover the depth
<BR>at which these codes mean to those whom follow them.
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;Filial Duty.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
One who is a Samurai should base his conduct on a strong sense of Filial
duty.&nbsp; Regard-
<BR>less if one is capable, clever, eloquent and handsome, if he is unfilial
he is of no use at all.&nbsp;&nbsp; Bushido
<BR>requires a man's conduct to be correct in all points and have a knowledge
of what's right.&nbsp; One who
<BR>doesn't know this cannot be a Samurai and once insight is gained, one
sees the parents as authors
<BR>of their beings.&nbsp; Now when rendering filial obligations to parents,
there are two variables.&nbsp; The first
<BR>is a parent who is honest, educates his children with sincere kindliness
and leaves them all his
<BR>property.&nbsp; This consists of income above average, weapons, horse
furniture, household treasures,
<BR>as well as arranging good marriages for them.&nbsp; When the parent
retires, one must care and meet
<BR>the every need of the retiree.&nbsp; This is what is meant by filial
duty.&nbsp; The other variable is a crude and
<BR>crotchety parent who nags, insists that all property is his, gives
his children nothing and despite
<BR>scanty means of the family, always asks for drink, food and clothes.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Even such a cantankerous
<BR>parent must be reverenced as a parent and bad attitude must be endured
without showing signs of
<BR>annoyance.&nbsp; Exerting oneself to the utmost for a parent is real
filial piety.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<I>"It is forbidden to forget the great debt of kindness</I>
<BR><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
one owes to his master and ancestors</I>
<BR><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
and thereby make light of the virtues of loyalty and filial piety."</I>
<BR><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</I>"The Regulations of Imagawa Ryoshun"

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A Samurai who possesses this spirit when he enters the service of a lord
will
<BR>thoroughly understand the Way of Loyalty and will show it not only
when his master is prosperous
<BR>but also if he meets adversary.&nbsp; Filial duty is vital to a Samurai
and terms like "parent" and "lord,"
<BR>"Filial Conduct" and "Loyalty" are distinct and yet they are no different
in meaning.&nbsp; If one cannot be
<BR>Filial to his parents, it is unlikely that he will give loyal service
to a lord of no relation out of pure
<BR>gratitude.&nbsp; If he cannot perform then he is useless.

<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;Samurai Ordinances.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In Bushido there are two ordinances and four sections.&nbsp; The two ordinances
consist
<BR>of ordinary and extraordinary.&nbsp; Ordinary is divided into two sections
of the official and of the
<BR>soldiers, while the extraordinary is divided into army and of battle
affairs.&nbsp; In the section of the
<BR>Samurai officials, they must wash their hands and feet every night
and morning and take a hot bath
<BR>to keep themselves clean.&nbsp;&nbsp; A Samurai must do his hair every
morning and keep the hair properly
<BR>shaved from his forehead.&nbsp; The he must always wear the ceremonial
dress proper to the occasion
<BR>and&nbsp; of course wear his two swords as well as carry a fan in his
girdle.&nbsp; When he receives a guest
<BR>he must treat him with the etiquette due to his rank and must refrain
from idle talk.&nbsp; When not
<BR>serving he must not lounge about aimlessly but read and practice writing.&nbsp;
By doing this he stores
<BR>his mind with ancient history and precepts of the warrior houses and
conducts himself at all times
<BR>so that his manners are those proper to a Samurai.&nbsp; The section
on soldiers consists of exercises
<BR>like fencing, spear practicing, horsemanship and shooting a bow; a
Samurai is an official for extra-
<BR>ordinary conditions and when the country is in a state of disorder,
he will leave from his daily life
<BR>to serve under his lord as commander.&nbsp; They then put their armor
on and advance into enemy
<BR>territory, this is a matter of the army affairs.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then comes
the rule of battle affairs, which is the method of handling the army when
it comes into contact with the enemy to give battle.&nbsp; To be called
a first-class&nbsp; Samurai is to be skilled in all four sections of these
two ordinances.&nbsp; To have knowledge
<BR>of only two&nbsp; sections may be fit for a average cavalier, but no
one ignorant of the extraordinary sections can become a commander or high
officier such as monogashirsa or bugyo.&nbsp; This is an
<BR>important consideration a Samurai must make to realize that they cannot
rise in position without profound study in the extraordinary ordinance.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The Offensive Spirit.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
It is important that a Samurai never forget his offensive spirit at any
time.&nbsp; With
<BR>death firmly fixed in the mind, a Samurai must anticipate anything
and maintain an aggressive spirit.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
" When you leave your gate, act as though an</I>
<BR><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
enemy was in sight."</I>

<P><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</I>It was a belief that one, even being a farmer, merchant and artisan,
should cherish
<BR>some rusty blade.&nbsp; Even wear a blunt sword or wooden one when
they went to bath.&nbsp; Despite not
<BR>having an aggressive spirit, one who wears a sword is nothing but a
farmer or a tradesman in a warrior's skin.
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Right and Wrong.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A warrior should have a thorough understanding of these two qualities.&nbsp;
If he
<BR>knows how to do one and avoid the other then he will have attained
Bushido.&nbsp; To be unstable and
<BR>make no distinction between right and wrong is contrary to reason,
anyone who understands this distinction&nbsp; and yet does what is wrong
is no proper Samurai, but a raw and untaught person.
<BR>And the cause of it is small capacity for self-control, if we examine
into its origin we find it arises
<BR>from cowardice.&nbsp; That is why a&nbsp; Samurai must refrain from
wrong and cleave to what is right.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Generally the rule of practice of right conduct is to feel shame at the
contempt
<BR>of our family, servants and friends.&nbsp; Then at the scorn of the
wider circle of our acquaintance and
<BR>of outsiders, and eschew the wrong and do the right.&nbsp; In time
this becomes a habit and one will prefer the right over the wrong.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Bravery
<BR><I>&nbsp;</I>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The three qualities of Loyalty, Right Conduct and Bravery are essential
<BR>for Bushido.&nbsp; The three qualities are loyal warrior, righteous
warrior and the valiant warrior.
<BR>The Samurai who possesses these, only he will be a warrior of the highest
class.&nbsp; Among the
<BR>myriad's of Samurai, a loyal and righteous warrior maybe easy to find,
but times of peace a brave
<BR>warrior is hard to single out.&nbsp; Bravery is not present when a
Samurai puts his armor one, you
<BR>will see this by his loyalty in his lord and parents.&nbsp; Among other
characteristics , he will not
<BR>neglect study and military arts;&nbsp; He will be reluctant to squander
his money or useless trivial
<BR>wants and needs.&nbsp; It is rigid self-control that is the beginning
of Valor.

<BR>&nbsp;Respect.

In Bushido, however loyal and filial a man may be in his heart, if he lacks
the
<BR>proper etiquette and manners which displays respect to&nbsp; lord or
parent, he cannot be regarded
<BR>as living in confromity with it.&nbsp; A man like this can be no proper
Samurai.&nbsp; Even in private or public,
<BR>one is not to disregard respect to lord or parent.
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Duties of a Samurai.

"The field of battle is my normal abode."</I>
<BR><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</I>Anonymous Samurai
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The duties of a Samurai are two fold, military and constructive.&nbsp;
When at war
<BR>he must be at camp always alert regardless of day or night.&nbsp; Construction
is associated here,
<BR>all sorts of strongholds, moats, embattled camps and fortified outposts
have to be up in little
<BR>time as possible.&nbsp; In time of peace they are allowed to have such
duties as guards, escorts,
<BR>inspectors, and come to see the stay-at-home function as normal and
think of field service like
<BR>a dream.&nbsp; When the time comes that they are asked to assist in
the shogun's government, they
<BR>gripe and rumble not realizing that to take part in both military and
constructive activities are
<BR>the regular business of a Samurai.&nbsp; Some find it quite hard even
in times of peace, however they
<BR>find it just as hard when they are asked to travel.&nbsp; When they
are sent out as Traveling Inspector,
<BR>they resent the fatigue and expense taken.&nbsp; Despite the fact that
it maybe near, they complain
<BR>of how many trips they make or the state of the weather.&nbsp; Those
that fulfil their duty in a mean
<BR>spirit are nothing more than low down servants in the skins of Samurai.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Samurai's true to the
<BR>Bushido will not take this as a burden or hardship, but all in the
ordinary day's work.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
As stated in before I introduced some ideas and I hope I provoked an interest.
<BR>To end this I thought about writing some huge reflection on my recent
study, while looking for
<BR>information I found this interesting quote that wraps it up great.&nbsp;&nbsp;
This was written in the seventeeth
<BR>century by a Samurai who had become a Zen Buddhist Monk.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I> "The Way of the Samurai is found
in death. When it comes to either /or, there is only the quick</I>
<BR><I>choice of&nbsp; death. When pressed with the choice of life or death,
it is not necessary to gain one's aim.</I>
<BR><I>We all want to live. And in large part we make our logic according
to what we like. But not having attained our aim and continuing to live
is cowardice. This is a dangerous thin line. To die without</I>
<BR><I>gaining one's aim is a dog's death and fanaticism. But there is
no shame in this. This is the substance</I>
<BR><I>of the Way of the Samurai. If by setting one's heart right every
morning and evening, one is able to</I>
<BR><I>live as though his body were already dead, he gains freedom in the
Way. His whole life will be without blame, and he will succeed in his calling....
Being a retainer is nothing other than being a supporter of one's lord,
entrusting matters of good&nbsp; and evil to him, and renouncing self-interest.
If there are</I>
<BR><I>but two or three men of this type, the fief will be secure. Loyalty
is said to be important in the pledge between lord and retainer. Though
it may seem unobtainable, it is right before your eyes. If you</I>
<BR><I>once set yourself to it, you will become a superb retainer at that
very moment.... The person without previous resolution to the inevitable
death makes certain that his death will be in bad form. But if one</I>
<BR><I>is resolved to death beforehand, in what way can he be despicable?
One should be especially diligent in this concern. If one were to say a
word what the condition of being a samurai is, its basis lies first in
seriously devoting one's body and soul to his master. And if one is asked
what to do beyond this, it</I>
<BR><I>would be to fit oneself inwardly with intelligence, humanity, and
courage. The combining of these</I>
<BR><I>three&nbsp; virtues may seem unobtainable to the ordinary person,
but it is easy. Intelligence is nothing</I>
<BR><I>more than discussing things with others. Limitless wisdom comes
from this. Humanity is something</I>
<BR><I>done for the sake of others, simply comparing oneself with them
and putting them in the fore. Courage</I>
<BR><I>is gritting one's teeth; it is simply doing that and pushing ahead,
paying no attention to&nbsp;&nbsp; the circumstances. Anything that seems
above these three is not necessary to be known. As for outward aspects,
there are personal appearance, one's way of speaking and calligraphy. And
as all of these are daily matters, they improve by constant practice. Basically,
one should perceive&nbsp; their nature to be</I>
<BR><I>one of quite strength. If one has accomplished all these things,
then he should have a knowledge of our area's history and customs. After
that he may study the various arts as recreation. If you think it</I>
<BR><I>over, being a retainer is simple. And these days, if you observe
people who are even a bit useful,</I>
<BR><I>you will see that they have accomplished these three outward aspects.</I>
