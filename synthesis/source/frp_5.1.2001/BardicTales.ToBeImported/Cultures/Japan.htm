    <UL>She's like a quiet mountain lake whose waters are rushing beneath the 
      surface toward a waterfall. She's like the face on a Noh mask, wrapped in 
      her own secrets.<BR>-- Fumiko Enchi, Masks, 1958
      <P></P></UL>"In fact the whole of Japan is a pure invention," Oscar Wilde 
    wrote in 1889. "There is no such country, there are no such people."
    <P>Japan had opened to the West just thirty years before Wilde made this 
    observation. Europe was awash in what the French call japonisme. Degas, 
    Manet, Whistler, Pissarro -- they were all fascinated by the imagery of 
    Japanese tradition. In 1887 van Gogh decorated Le Père Tanguy with prints of 
    Mount Fuji and geisha in elaborate kimonos. Gauguin made gouaches on paper 
    cut to the shape of Japanese fans. This infatuation permeated society. It 
    was reflected on teapots and vases, in the fabric of women's dresses, and in 
    the way people arranged flowers. 
    <P>But what did japonisme have to do with Japan as it was? The Japan of the 
    1880s was erecting factories and assembling steamships, conscripting an army 
    and preparing a parliament. There were universities, offices, department 
    stores, banks. As Wilde elaborated, "The actual people who live in Japan are 
    not unlike the general run of English people; that is to say, they are 
    extremely commonplace, and have nothing curious or extraordinary about 
    them." 
    <P>Wilde was ahead of his time. We now have a word, albeit a contentious 
    one, for the phenomenon he touched upon, if incidentally, in "The Decay of 
    Lying." It is called Orientalism. Orientalism meant "the eternal East." In 
    his account of Japan Wilde left out only the quotation marks, for he was 
    writing about the simple, serene, perfume-scented "Japan" of the 
    Orientalist's imaginings. 
    <P>Orientalism was made of received notions and images of the people, 
    cultures, and societies that stretch from the eastern Mediterranean to the 
    Pacific. There was no dynamism or movement in the Oriental society. The 
    Orient was fixed in immutable patterns, discernible through the ages and 
    eternally repeated, like the mosaics in Middle Eastern mosques. It did not, 
    in a word, progress. Deprived of the Enlightenment, the East displayed no 
    rational thought, no logic or science. The Oriental merely existed, a 
    creature ruled by fate, timeless tradition, and an ever-present touch of 
    sorrow. The Oriental was "exotic" rather than ordinary, "inscrutable" rather 
    than comprehensible, dusky rather than light. The Orient was the "other" of 
    the West, and the twain would never meet. 
    <P>Japan, farthest east from the metropolitan capitals and least known among 
    explorers, became the object of extreme Orientalist fantasies as soon as 
    Europeans arrived, in 1542. The first Westerners to record their impressions 
    were missionaries, who took Japan and the Japanese to be a place and a 
    people "beyond imagining," as an Italian Jesuit put it, "a world the reverse 
    of Europe." Europeans were tall, the Japanese were short. Churches were 
    high, temples low. European women whitened their teeth, Japanese women 
    blackened theirs. Japan was an antipodean universe, ever yielding, ever 
    prostrate. "The people are incredibly resigned to their sufferings and 
    hardships," the Jesuit wrote on another occasion, "yet they live quietly and 
    contentedly in their misery and poverty." Francis Xavier, who arrived in 
    1549, asked why the Japanese did not write "in our way" -- from left to 
    right, across. His Japanese guide replied with a question that would have 
    done Francis some good had he troubled with its implications: Why did 
    Europeans not write in the Japanese way, from right to left, down? 
    <P>The observations of sixteenth-century Europeans were not pure invention. 
    By tradition Japanese women did blacken their teeth. An air of resignation 
    is as evident among the Japanese today as it must have been then. And 
    Japanese locks -- a peculiar obsession among these first visitors, noted 
    again and again -- are still opened by turning the key to the left, not (as 
    in the West) to the right. But what makes these observations faintly 
    ridiculous? Why did they produce the enduring idea of a place populated by 
    mysterious gnomes? From our distant point of view it was a simple failure of 
    perspective. The early travelers made no connections: That is, the Japanese 
    were not permitted, if that is the word, their own history, a past by which 
    their great and small differences could have been explained. 
    <P>Orientalism grew from empire. One of its features was the position of the 
    observer to the observed: The one was always superior to the other. As 
    Edward Said stresses in Orientalism, intellectual conventions reflected 
    relationships based on power and material benefit. So Orientalism came into 
    full flower in Britain and France, the great empire builders of the 
    nineteenth century. Japan was never formally a part of anyone's empire, but 
    it was hardly free of the Orientalism associated with imperial possessions. 
    Its relations with Europe were based on the same material interests and were 
    marked by the same presumed superiority on the part of Europeans. 
    <P>Today, of course, we call someone from India, Indonesia, Taiwan, or Japan 
    an Asian rather than an Oriental. Our term is an attempt, at least, to 
    acknowledge human complexity and diversity -- and equality. To call someone 
    an Oriental would give at least mild offense, because it would recall 
    relations that no longer exist -- at least not on maps. But this is not to 
    say that the habits of Orientalism are not still with us, as any Asian can 
    point out. Our Orientalism is remarkable only for its fidelity to the ideas 
    of centuries past: Japanese society is "vertical," while in the West social 
    relations are "horizontal"; Westerners like competition, the Japanese 
    compromise. When an earthquake struck Kobe in 1995 an American correspondent 
    described the city as "an antipodean New York with more sushi." Asians 
    stoically accept natural calamities as part of the timeless order of things, 
    he explained, so that "the Japanese of Kobe are ideal disaster victims." 
    <P>There was one peculiar aspect of Wilde's idea of Orientalism. He observed 
    that the image of Japan abroad in the last century was partly a concoction 
    of the Japanese themselves. Wilde called the Japanese "the deliberate 
    self-conscious creation" of artists such as Hokusai, whose woodblock prints 
    were much the fashion at the height of Europe's japonisme. This was 
    exceptionally astute. We could easily make the same assertion about many of 
    Japan's leaders and thinkers throughout history. "Japan" has long been an 
    act of the imagination among the Japanese, too, and to call some Japanese 
    Orientalists is to stretch the term but slightly. 
    <P>America did not much participate in Orientalism as a system of thought 
    because it had no Eastern empire. It was a tag-along among the imperialists. 
    In the nineteenth-century rush of flag planting it possessed only the 
    Philippines, and only briefly. But what about America after 1945? In the 
    postwar world "the American century" came into full flower, nowhere more 
    than in the Pacific -- and nowhere in the Pacific more than in Japan. The 
    occupation of Japan from 1945 to 1952 was only nominally an allied exercise. 
    Douglas MacArthur was called the supreme commander for the allied powers, 
    S.C.A.P., but his general headquarters, G.H.Q., was an American outpost. 
    Just as every Japanese alive today understands the old alphabet soup, so is 
    it understood that it was the Americans who determined Japan's postwar 
    course. 
    <P>America developed its own version of Orientalism after the Second World 
    War. We not only fixed Japan and the Japanese in our minds as a certain kind 
    of country populated by a certain kind of people; we went on to create the 
    country and the people we imagined. This was not accomplished alone, of 
    course. America, without a trace of irony, enlisted the help of those who 
    had led Japan into the war against American soldiers. The British used to 
    call this indirect rule and applied it chiefly in their African possessions. 
    It was a neat fit for the Americans in Japan, for Tokyo's prewar 
    conservatives were practiced Orientalists themselves, and they did much to 
    assist America in its reinvention of their country. 
    <P>The version of Japan concocted after the war is still widely accepted. It 
    is reflected in Washington's treatment of Tokyo, which resembles the way a 
    colonial power treats a dependency; more prevalently, it is evident in the 
    way ordinary Americans think of Japan and the Japanese. Our "Japan" has 
    advanced somewhat beyond kimonos and conical straw hats, though not 
    entirely. We are still stuck with the quotation marks. In the 1970s we took 
    to calling our imagined Japan "Japan Inc." -- an entire nation cast as a 
    corporation, and its people as employees rather than citizens. This 
    conception of Japan is still taken as genuine throughout the West. 
    <P>The novelist Kenzaburo Oe complains often about the two images of Japan 
    the West now entertains. There is the old Japan of samurai and Zen gardens, 
    and the new Japan of gadgets and efficiency. "Between the two," he once told 
    me, "there is a blank, where the Japanese live." When he received the Nobel 
    Prize for Literature, in 1994, Oe said to an American writer who interviewed 
    him in Stockholm: 
    <P>I am fascinated by Ralph Ellison's great book, Invisible Man, and it 
    applies to us -- us Japanese. . . . You can see Japanese technology in 
    Europe, you know all about Japanese economic power, you know all about the 
    quaint tea ceremony; but these are all images, masks of Japanese modesty or 
    technological strength. . . . Even today, more than a hundred and 
    twenty-five years after our great modernization, . . . we are inscrutable in 
    the eyes of Europeans and Americans. . . . There is not much of a desire to 
    understand the people who make all those Hondas. I don't know why. Perhaps 
    we only imitate the West or are just silent in the face of European peoples. 
    america and japan have had a complex relationship over the past fifty years. 
    They are as close as any two countries could be -- which, I believe, is too 
    close, for neither nation has done well out of its ties to the other during 
    the last half century. Yet after all the years of intimacy the Japanese are 
    still considered inscrutable. Kenzaburo Oe is not alone in applying this 
    tired term. It is true that the Japanese are a reserved people, ungiven to 
    self-revelation even among themselves. It is also true, as it was a century 
    ago, that Japan's image today is partly of its own making. But this does not 
    explain the cloudy picture. The Japanese remain inscrutable because from the 
    occupation onward -- indeed, for a long time before the war -- we have never 
    looked directly at them with a desire to understand who they are. 
    <P>Americans began their occupation of Japan with an ambitious plan to 
    remake the Japanese -- to reinvent them in the American image -- and ended 
    by restoring the very things and the very people they had arrived intending 
    to uproot and destroy. The initial effort was made of New Deal goodwill and 
    the latter of Cold War calculation. But one thing united these two extremes: 
    At no point did Japan's occupiers try to see the Japanese as anything other 
    than a reflection of themselves. 
    <P>The occupation's initial orders arrived from Washington in the autumn of 
    1945. They were remarkable for their sweep and idealism. MacArthur's G.H.Q. 
    was to do nothing less than liberate the Japanese from the agony of their 
    past and the absolutists who had used the vestiges of feudalism to lead 
    Japan into tragedy. Politically, the occupation was to "democratize." 
    Economically, it was to structure "a wide distribution of income and 
    ownership of the means of production and trade." This was hardly the sort of 
    language one would expect of Washington, but the era of Rooseveltian social 
    crusades had carried over into the war years, and its vocabulary suited the 
    evangelists who staffed the G.H.Q. They wanted to change everything about 
    the Japanese -- their hearts, minds, and souls. Unofficially this extended 
    to the introduction of pocket billiards, square dancing, bowling, big-band 
    jazz. It would all make the Japanese better, happier people. "One trembles," 
    an occupation memoirist noted, "at American presumption." 
    <P>It is well known that the first soldiers to arrive in Japan after August 
    15, 1945, were shocked by their reception. People apparently prepared to die 
    for the emperor a few days earlier greeted their conquerors with a relief 
    approaching joy. Why was this? Because the Japanese have no morals, or 
    honesty, or convictions? Or because, as a Japanese friend once told me, "Our 
    only principle is that we have no principles"? 
    <P>It would be hard to exaggerate the enthusiasm of ordinary Japanese for 
    the occupation's original agenda. People old enough to recall the first 
    postsurrender years are still deeply nostalgic about them, desperate as 
    those years were. But no Japanese knew what was in store right after the 
    surrender. No gift resembling democracy had yet been presented. A gift so 
    large is always a problem, anyway. In the end, of course, no one can either 
    give it or receive it, as the Japanese soon learned. So it is fair to ask 
    what precisely it was the Japanese appreciated as the Americans arrived. All 
    they knew was that the war was over, that they would not be dying for the 
    emperor, and that the victors had no intention of slaughtering them: three 
    surprises. 
    <P>America's greatest gift, the one the Japanese still bittersweetly 
    remember, was a smaller one. It was the prospect that they would have a 
    chance to begin again, to find a new path forward. This gift lay in the 
    extent, limited though it was, to which the occupation gave the Japanese the 
    room to make their own choices -- to form political parties and labor 
    unions, for instance, and to choose leaders by a method of their own making. 
    It allowed the Japanese to question the norms and customs by which they had 
    previously lived. Most of all, they were encouraged to think and make 
    decisions as individuals for the first time in their long history. In all of 
    this the Americans appeared to be something like gods. Accounts of the era 
    often dwell with wonder upon the sheer physicality of the arriving G.I.'s, 
    who impressed the population not only with their size, their smiles, and 
    their generosity, but because in their very gestures they expressed a 
    freedom, an autonomy, and a natural at-homeness with themselves that the 
    Japanese instantly recognized as absent in their own character. 
    <P>Unfortunately, the Americans' generous gift -- the gift of standing 
    aside, one might say -- was always attenuated and was quickly withdrawn 
    altogether. In the autumn of 1946 American voters did to Harry Truman what 
    they would do again, to Bill Clinton, in 1994 and 1996: They gave a 
    Democratic president Republican majorities in both houses of Congress. 
    America was never of one mind as to how Japan should be remade. There had 
    long been a constituency for the idea that Japan was a "yellow peril" that, 
    if it was not entertaining partnerships with European fascists, might as 
    easily turn leftward toward communism. The 1946 elections tipped the scales 
    -- first in America, then in Tokyo. The Japanese refer to the events that 
    followed as "the reverse course." As the shorthand implies, the change in 
    American priorities was fundamental. 
    <P>The reverse course began in 1947, when the New Dealers at G.H.Q. were 
    purged in favor of anticommunist ideologues and fiscal conservatives. A year 
    later it arrived as policy in the form of a National Security Council 
    directive written by George Kennan, the noted architect of communist 
    containment. Modest in title but vast in import, N.S.C. 13/2 brought the 
    Cold War to Japan. The following year Mao took Beijing, and the year after 
    that the Korean war began. These events sealed the fate of the original 
    postwar reforms -- and for the next forty years, the fate of the Japanese. 
    <P>N.S.C. 13/2 abandoned reform in favor of economic recovery and -- grail 
    of the Cold War era -- stability. It called for "high exports through hard 
    work," but the directive's language does not convey how profoundly it 
    changed the work-in-progress called postwar Japan. Everything was to be 
    sacrificed to containment. Purges of right-wing nationalists stopped and 
    purges of those judged inimical to American interests began. Efforts to 
    disband the zaibatsu, family-led combines that had stood behind Japan's 
    expansion on the Asian mainland and later supplied the war effort, were 
    halted. Before 1948 was out the prewar industrialists were back in their 
    offices and the old political elite was again running Japan. 
    <P>Certain of the reforms lasted. No one can deny the importance of the 
    civil rights Americans wrote into the postwar constitution (though these 
    have often been abused). Land for landless farmers ended an old iniquity and 
    remains a tribute to the early occupation (though land reform eventually 
    produced new political inequalities). But most of the initial reforms were 
    severely compromised -- some fatally. 
    <P>Consider the purge of the prewar order. It was extensive in the military, 
    wiping out most of the nationalist fanatics America fought the war to 
    defeat. G.H.Q. did not need the Japanese army -- not until the early 1950s, 
    anyway. Eighty percent of those eventually purged were militarists. But what 
    about other areas: politics, the economy, and the powerful bureaucracy? Here 
    the purge was sketchy at best. The restructured successors of the zaibatsu 
    are still with us. Eight hundred and thirty bureaucrats -- fewer than 2 
    percent of those screened -- were purged. MacArthur used the prewar 
    bureaucracy to run the country; the bureaucrats even ran the purge program. 
    Politicians accounted for one in six of those barred from public life. A 
    little more than a decade after the war, Japan had an accused war criminal 
    as prime minister. 
    <P>Japanese attitudes toward America have never recovered from the reverse 
    course. Today the early period is recalled as a kind of Tokyo spring -- a 
    sentimental memory enhanced by the brevity of the season. Democracy came and 
    went so quickly that the Japanese were soon debating whether they had ever 
    had it. As early as 1950 the scholar Masao Maruyama declared Japanese 
    democracy a fiction not worth defending. After the reverse course those who 
    had looked up to Americans suddenly felt betrayed and distanced, while those 
    who had so recently detested the victors found in them an ally in their 
    quest to regain power. There are now few Japanese whose feelings about 
    America are untinged with the ambivalence borne of this period: admiration 
    and dislike, respect and mistrust. 
    <P>America spins many myths about its postwar performance in Japan. 
    "Considering what it might have been," an American analyst observed, "the 
    American occupation proved to be, on balance, a surprisingly positive 
    experience for both the victor and the vanquished." This was written in 
    1987; it is entirely typical of the American accounting of things since the 
    occupation ended. But to consider "what it might have been" is a treacherous 
    invitation. It is precisely when we accept it that our occupation of Japan 
    is devalued, for it could have been so much more than what it turned out to 
    be. And what did it turn out to be? This question is easily answered, for 
    the Japan before us today is the same one America created after the war: 
    extravagantly corrupt, obsessed with market dominance, ecologically 
    reckless, stifling of the individual, politically dysfunctional, leaderless, 
    incapable of decisions. 
    <P>How is it that Japan has remained frozen in such a state for five 
    decades? The answer lies in two documents. One is the constitution written 
    under General MacArthur and made law in 1947. Its most famous clause, 
    Article 9, gives it the name by which it is commonly known -- the peace 
    constitution -- because it barred Japan from raising an army and limited 
    military activity to the defense of its natural borders. The other is the 
    security treaty signed in 1951 and implemented the following year. It placed 
    Japan under American military protection. Americans were responsible for 
    both documents, and it is remarkable that they exist side by side, for 
    together they are a tour de force in political and diplomatic schizophrenia, 
    the disease from which Japan still suffers. 
    <P>The man who passed this affliction on to his countrymen was named Shigeru 
    Yoshida. It was Yoshida who, with American support, brought the prewar 
    politicians back to power in 1948. The son of a Meiji-era liberal, Yoshida 
    was a practiced diplomat before the war, an English-speaking bureaucrat who 
    moved in peerage circles close to the throne. He was a nationalist but no 
    militarist, and over several years of dexterous politicking, he and 
    MacArthur cobbled together what can neatly be termed "the Yoshida deal." 
    <P>The blunt but witty Yoshida famously held that Japan could win by 
    peaceful means what it had lost in military adventure. It was Yoshida who 
    placed Japan under the American security umbrella and turned the imperial 
    army's lost crusade into the grinding war of attrition we track today with 
    trade statistics. The Yoshida deal brought abundant benefits, but it found 
    shrill critics all around. Neither pacifists nor nationalists have ever 
    quite digested one or another of its particulars. Coerced by John Foster 
    Dulles, America's premier cold warrior, Yoshida oversaw Japan's undeclared 
    rearmament: Japan today is the world's sixth most expensively armed country. 
    He also let American military bases remain after the occupation ended -- 
    which, four decades on, look like a permanent garrison. The price of this 
    arrangement was nothing less than sovereignty, but Japan wasted no time 
    proving Yoshida's point about making economic victory of military defeat. 
    <P>Among the remarkable things about the Yoshida deal is that it was struck 
    after Japan had already spent four years under the peace constitution, a 
    document that also had its enemies. Rightists who favored rearmament 
    detested it; the new Cold War establishment in Washington considered it a 
    mistake as soon as it was written. Even pacifists balked before backing it, 
    since they disliked the idea of American domination. MacArthur never stopped 
    defending the basic law he gave Japan, but that was simply MacArthur being 
    MacArthur: He wanted a memorial to his administration modeled on the 
    constitution he wrote for the Philippines in 1935. 
    <P>There was a gaping contradiction between the peace constitution and 
    Japan's Cold War assignment. But logically enough, MacArthur and Yoshida 
    found the only way around it: They ignored it, so beginning Japan's postwar 
    schizophrenia. Japan was pacifist by law, but by treaty (and in practice) a 
    spear carrier in the anticommunist crusade. Once the Japanese were drawn 
    into the Cold War, the political center hollowed out. Voters supported the 
    constitution America gave them, which meant opposing America; or they 
    supported the corruption of the constitution, so pleasing the nation that 
    provided it. The Japanese call the political equation that fixed these 
    polarities the "1955 system." In the autumn of that year the Socialists* 
    reunited after several years of infighting. In response the two leading 
    conservative parties joined to become the Liberal Democrats, who kept the 
    rule of the old elite intact for the next thirty-eight years. 
    <P>Through the 1955 system America exercised immense power over Japan after 
    the occupation ended, as it does today. Tokyo has articulated few foreign 
    policy decisions without Washington's approval -- none until the 1970s -- 
    and it usually supports American aims even when they run counter to Japanese 
    interests. We pretend Japan is an independent country, but fundamentally it 
    is a military protectorate, as the Japanese, along with most people other 
    than Americans, understand. America's power has also extended within. For 
    roughly twenty years after the occupation, Washington did in Japan what it 
    did in many Third World countries during the Cold War: It covertly but 
    actively supported the political elite it had restored in 1948. Then it 
    invited the rest of the world to pretend along with Americans that Japan was 
    a working democracy. 
    <P>And how did a small group of conservative politicians, closet xenophobes 
    obsequious toward America but commanding no great enthusiasm among voters, 
    hold power without serious challenge until 1993? This question has been 
    asked often from the 1950s onward. And because Japan possesses the machinery 
    of a democracy, the answer has not been simple. That there has been no 
    credible alternative to the Liberal Democrats is true, but why? Because of 
    corruption? Yes, but whose corruption? Why is Japan run by a system of 
    patronage presided over by a succession of inept village headmen cast 
    incongruously onto the world stage? 
    <P>The answer lies in the nature of the reinstalled leaders from before the 
    war. Rechristened Liberal Democrats, they prolonged traditional political 
    customs -- deference to authority, village identity, political clans, vote 
    purchasing -- long after such practices ought to have died natural deaths. 
    In short, the conservative elite self-perpetuated by discouraging democratic 
    habits. And to what extent did the Americans assist in this endeavor? This 
    is not altogether clear. But it has been a little clearer since 1994, when 
    the New York Times revealed that the Central Intelligence Agency had been 
    secretly passing funds to the governing party until well into the 1970s. 
    With them America manipulated elections, backed favorite premiers, and 
    debilitated the political opposition. These funds numbered at least in the 
    tens of millions of dollars, perhaps in the hundreds of millions. We do not 
    know: The C.I.A. will not tell us. 
    <P>America's concern was that of a Cold War commander. It feared for the 
    loyalty of its troops. Specifically, Washington worried that a politically 
    independent Japan would take the Switzerland-in-Asia route -- that is, 
    choose neutrality between East and West and opt out of the Cold War crusade. 
    This was a possibility; we referred to it as a "danger." But it is 
    reasonable, nonetheless, to take these secret events, along with the reverse 
    course, as a measure of the importance America placed on a working democracy 
    in Japan, and the regard it had for the Japanese people. The logic was the 
    same as during the Vietnam war, when we burned villages to save them: We 
    subverted democracy to save it. 
    <P>Americans do not think of themselves as subverters of the democratic 
    process in other countries. Destroying the choices of other people was what 
    the Soviets were doing in Eastern Europe. This is an image of ourselves we 
    choose to obfuscate, though most other nations, even our friends, have 
    always been more polite about it than they have been fooled. It will be 
    difficult for us to face this aspect of our recent past, but with the Cold 
    War over, sooner or later we will have to. 
    <P>America's habit of dissembling reflected the essential Cold War bind: the 
    chasm between the ideal and the real, the pretense and the actual. The space 
    between the two is familiar to the Japanese: The Cold War produced only one 
    more version of the gap between "Japan" and Japan, a distinction the 
    Japanese had long lived with. Along with the millions in covert funds, this 
    conditioned accommodation is why the Cold War, after some initial choking, 
    seemed to go down smoothly despite its bitter taste. The Japanese have a 
    phrase by which they learned long ago to live with their disappointments: 
    "Shiyo ga nai," they say, it can't be helped. It is true far less frequently 
    than the Japanese believe, but it expresses an emotion I place among their 
    most basic: desire without hope. And it was desire without hope that the 
    Japanese felt as they watched America destroy their postwar experiment. 
    <P>It was not enough, though, that Japan was America's forward outpost in 
    the Pacific, as George Kennan described it in N.S.C. 13/2 -- an "unsinkable 
    aircraft carrier," as a Japanese leader would later put it. Japan had to 
    have a certain appearance, too. It had to choose the West. No other choice 
    was acceptable, of course; Japan's entry into the Cold War was nothing more 
    or less than a forced march. But Japan had to appear pristinely democratic 
    in its decision to follow America. And -- no small thing -- the Japanese had 
    to be calm and happy with their lot. These matters were of supreme 
    importance, for Japan would be a model in a region Washington viewed as one 
    of teetering dominoes. 
    <P>John Foster Dulles, as President Dwight Eisenhower's secretary of state, 
    took an early and active interest in cultivating the proper image of Japan. 
    During the decade after the war this concern grew in Washington and led 
    American scholars to conceive a new picture of the country America had 
    recently defeated at great cost. This picture gradually advanced into the 
    mainstream of American thought -- first in scholarly papers and texts, then 
    in popular books, and finally in films, newspapers, and advertising. It 
    became, in short, the new paradigm. It became part of what we can now call 
    our "victory culture," that postwar set of beliefs about ourselves and 
    others that amounts to an updated, American version of the old Orientalism. 
    <P>The manipulation of history was of fundamental importance in this 
    exercise, for the paradigm rested largely on an image -- not of Japan after 
    the war, and still less of the war itself, but of what came before the war. 
    It was by recasting Japan's past that America's winning portrait of its 
    Asian ally emerged. One could not pretend to alter the facts, Stalin-like. 
    But they could be made to serve the emerging ideology nonetheless. History 
    could be tailored with nips and tucks -- by glossing over its unattractive 
    parts and making much of minor matters. And with the past reshaped, the 
    present would appear other than what it was. 
    <P>Japan made itself modern, at least economically, with extraordinary speed 
    after the Meiji Restoration of 1868. But its people paid heavily for the 
    course their leaders chose. There was no political freedom and much 
    exploitation; feudal customs were preserved to prevent the development of 
    democracy and modern social arrangements. The leadership suffused the nation 
    with xenophobia and militarism to further its imperial ambitions. Above all, 
    there was much conflict and dissent -- and as much violence in its 
    suppression. Until America took an interest in how Japan appeared to others, 
    these were the ordinary facts of history. They were what the allies fought 
    the war about. They had been established by a generation of scholars 
    dedicated to understanding the complex, troubled path Japan followed as it 
    modernized. 
    <P>Then these facts were pushed to the margins, so that America could 
    justify its "Japan" -- Japan as it had been reassembled from the past to 
    suit new purposes. What had been so recently understood as burdensome feudal 
    practices became "tradition." Tradition was embodied in the emperor, a good 
    man who had opposed the war. Tradition explained the enviable work ethic of 
    the Japanese, their patience with poor living conditions, their easy 
    acquiescence to authority. Harmony and consensus prevailed, and strife was a 
    foreign thing, for the Japanese were a modest people given to compromise in 
    all matters. Nagatacho, Tokyo's political quarter, was not a hive of corrupt 
    ultranationalists resurrected from wartime cliques; it was the home of East 
    Asia's first up-and-running parliamentary democracy. 
    <P>The new paradigm produced two essential conclusions, and whether we are 
    aware of them or not, they are the basis of what we assume to be true about 
    Japan. The first was that the country's fifteen years of aggression were an 
    aberration, a blip in an otherwise unbroken line. There was nothing really 
    wrong with the Japanese system: It had swerved off course, but only briefly, 
    and the occupation fixed that. One need not come to terms with the Pacific 
    war, because it stood outside of Japan's progress toward liberal democracy. 
    The second conclusion followed easily: Not much was required by way of 
    postwar reform. In one of the best-known books to argue this point, Edwin O. 
    Reischauer asserted that "a slight readjustment of the rules" was all Japan 
    needed to reverse the history of the 1930s and resume its westward stride. 
    <P>This, in bare-bones outline, is the paradigm. Japan was responsible for 
    one of the century's great tragedies, and its people subjected to many forms 
    of degradation, but overnight these stark realities all but vanished. The 
    Japanese were our allies -- our hard-working, uncomplicated, compliant 
    friends. Trade spats and bickering over security matters have frayed the 
    basic conceit in recent years, but this remains the image of Japan that we 
    take to be true today. And establishing it so firmly was no small 
    accomplishment. But those who created it often had the support of government 
    agencies and private foundations -- a point worth noting, for there can be 
    few other occasions, if any, when American scholarship was so thoroughly in 
    the service of official ideology. 
    <P>A number of the scholars who projected the new image taught at Harvard 
    University. Prominent among them was Reischauer, a missionary's son who was 
    born in Japan and whose life and career -- scholar, Washington advisor, 
    diplomat -- remained intimately tied to the Japanese the whole of his life. 
    Reischauer minced many words during his career, but not all of them. Within 
    a few years of the surrender he was urging Washington to recognize that 
    scholarship could be useful as "propaganda work," as he put it, and that 
    history rescripted could have "very profound practical results." Reischauer 
    was hardly alone in these odd notions of the professor's task, but he was 
    singularly keen on what we might call applied knowledge. 
    <P>When the occupation ended Reischauer quickly pronounced it an unqualified 
    success. The purges of wartime politicians and zaibatsu executives were 
    completed, he declared. By his account there was no reverse course: There 
    had been a "retrenchment," but only because the reforms were a thoroughgoing 
    triumph. "What was now needed was for the Japanese themselves to adjust the 
    new rules to Japanese realities," Reischauer wrote in 1953, "and to gain 
    experience in living and governing themselves according to democratic 
    processes." Consider the implications of this statement. Who would teach the 
    Japanese these things? Who would show them how democracy worked? Reinstalled 
    officials from the 1930s dictatorship, the people who invented the thought 
    police? This is what Reischauer must have meant, for they were back in 
    charge. 
    <P>These passages are from a single page in Reischauer's book The Japanese 
    Today: 
    <P>On the surface Japan gives all the appearances of a happy society and 
    probably deserves this evaluation as much as any other country. 
    <P>Cultural schizophrenia, which may seem obvious to the untutored Western 
    eye, simply does not exist for the Japanese, except possibly for some 
    self-conscious intellectuals. 
    <P>The Japanese are clearly well satisfied with themselves both as 
    individuals and nationally. Until only a few decades ago they tended to be 
    painfully unsure of themselves, fearing that Westerners might be looking 
    down on them, but in recent years such self-doubts have melted fast in the 
    warmth of affluence and international acclaim. 
    <P>First published in 1977 (as The Japanese) and brought up to date in 1988, 
    The Japanese Today, Reischauer's most influential book, is packed with 
    untruths, passages that bear no relation to Japanese reality, passages that 
    can fairly be called propaganda passed off as history. The author's most 
    remarkable assertion occurs in the 1977 edition (and is little altered in 
    later printings). "Political corruption is not widespread in Japan," he 
    notes in passing. Reischauer then observes that one does hear constant 
    "cries of corruption" from the Japanese public. But he explains away such 
    cries with the observation that foreigners do not understand what they 
    really mean. 
    <P>Reischauer cast a spell. So did others with the same perspective. Among 
    the best-known books of this genre was Ezra Vogel's Japan As Number One, 
    published in 1979. This was one long invitation to Americans to learn their 
    lessons from the Japanese -- lessons about consensus, the "higher interests" 
    of politics, the excellence of Japanese schools, and the cooperative 
    atmosphere in Japanese factories. Any wage earner in a Western country who 
    sings a company anthem, who belongs to a quality circle, or who accepts 
    membership in a company union has been influenced by Reischauer, Vogel, and 
    the scholars with whom they worked. So has anyone who believes Japan to be a 
    country of adjusted, conflict-free followers. Or who criticizes Japan's 
    habits in international trade and security without troubling to understand 
    the extent to which America is responsible for those habits. 
    <P>The Japanese Today and its many companion volumes describe another 
    "Japan" -- the Orientalist "Japan" Americans conceived after the war. It is 
    the "Japan" we still read about in our newspapers. But it is not Japan. the 
    reischauer circle became known as the Chrysanthemum Club, so named for the 
    seal of the Japanese imperial house. The term was never meant to flatter. 
    Chrysanthemem Club members were called geisha. They were considered 
    uncritical apologists for Japan, a role they fulfilled on many occasions. 
    Theirs was the perspective of results. That is, they left out or glossed 
    over the unattractive things about Japan so that "success" appeared to be 
    the sanitary consequence of altogether agreeable arrangements. In The 
    Japanese Today everything is winning, with the exception of intellectuals, 
    with whom the reader must not trouble himself. The appearance of "cultural 
    schizophrenia" and corruption are put down to "the untutored Western eye." 
    <P>In so simple a universe it is no wonder Americans set off in the 1970s in 
    search of the "secrets" behind Japan's economic "miracle." We found these 
    just where we were supposed to, in Japan's synthetic "traditions": in its 
    respect for hierarchy and order, its sense of common purpose, its habit of 
    company loyalty. A myth to match the American cowboy emerged, the myth of 
    the "corporate warrior," known in Japan as the ordinary sarariman, the 
    salaryman, the employee tied to a major corporation for his entire career. 
    <P>We are all familiar with the samurai who carries a briefcase. The 
    Japanese worker, whether he is on the shop floor in a clean white jumpsuit 
    or behind a desk piled high with papers, is the key figure in the postwar 
    economy. And he is so "satisfied with the way things are going" (Reischauer, 
    The Japanese Today) that he has no interest in labor unions. Strikes are 
    unwanted inconveniences; he prefers a consensus between labor and 
    management. If he belongs to a union at all, it is one organized by his 
    employers -- a company union, otherwise known as a house, or "enterprise," 
    union. 
    <P>Let us consider briefly the history of Japanese labor. In it we find a 
    fundamental lesson. 
    <P>Even before the turn of our century, the rush to modernize prompted 
    widespread strife in the nation's new factories. Conditions were horrendous 
    and absenteeism chronic; job turnover was often more than 100 percent a 
    year. Labor agents enticed farm girls into textile mills with false 
    promises. Those who "escaped" from factories were hunted down by private 
    policemen. Wildcat strikes were more or less constant. Nobody could organize 
    the first generation of industrial workers in Japanese history -- not the 
    new managers and not the first would-be unionists. 
    <P>In 1912 a Christian activist named Bunji Suzuki founded a union called 
    Yuaikai, the Friendly Society. Yuaikai had an interesting platform. It 
    preached social reform and moderate unionism -- it did not advocate strikes, 
    for instance -- but it encouraged members to assert themselves as 
    individuals, a notion Suzuki called "self-revolution." Later unionists 
    likened Yuaikai's founding document to "the pledge of a Sunday school club." 
    The criticism is fair. But the society became Japan's first national union. 
    In 1919 it changed both its name (to the Greater Japan Federation of Labor) 
    and its political stance; it then became an important voice in a newly 
    assertive labor movement. 
    <P>The 1920s sound a dissonant chord in the land of the dedicated corporate 
    warrior. No year saw fewer than 250 major strikes. Violence was rife. During 
    this decade employers began the first enterprise unions, structured not 
    according to a trade or skill but by company affiliation. This arrangement 
    led to a practice familiar today: the involvement of employers in all 
    aspects of their employees' lives in the name of shared interests. What was 
    public and what was private were thoroughly muddled. Over time a powerful 
    group identity was imposed. House unions multiplied, but they had nothing to 
    do with harmonious sentiment. The cooperation of most employees was forced. 
    <P>In 1938 the military dictatorship made all unions dissolve into the 
    Industrial Patriotic Society, abbreviated in Japanese as Sanpo. Sanpo's name 
    speaks for itself. Its aims were coerced calm in the workplace and, as the 
    war escalated, higher production levels. Everyone from presidents to tea 
    ladies had to belong. We can gauge Sanpo's popularity by what happened in 
    1945. Within four months of the surrender twelve hundred independent unions 
    had nine hundred thousand members. At the end of the 1940s membership was 
    6.7 million -- 56 percent of the workforce. 
    <P>The occupation was generous with the rights of workers. Union membership, 
    strikes, and collective bargaining were all protected. Large labor 
    federations formed. But freely organized labor was an early casualty of the 
    reverse course. Displeased with the ties unions formed with political 
    parties, the G.H.Q.'s cold warriors quickly opened the way to attacks on 
    labor from the restored political and business elites, and it was the 1920s 
    all over again. Seven hundred thousand workers were fired between 1949 and 
    1950; twelve thousand were labeled communists or communist sympathizers. 
    House unions were rebuilt, often upon the remnants of Sanpo. 
    <P>Gutted but standing, the independent unions of the postsurrender period 
    hobbled on. Since 1955, labor's main event each year has been the shunto, or 
    spring offensive, in which unions bargain for a nationwide wage settlement. 
    The shunto has been more or less effective over the years, but that depends 
    on economic conditions and what industry decides it is willing to give. It 
    is less a negotiation than a ritual. It is as if employees are permitted to 
    unite once a year to announce, "We are independent, and we are autonomous 
    participants in the economy," though of course they are neither. 
    <P>It is true now, as any Chrysanthemum Club scholar would assert, that the 
    average employee does not care much about unions. Today less than a quarter 
    of Japan's fifty million employees belong even to house unions. But this is 
    so not because life is perfectly satisfying as it is; it is because unions 
    have been rendered more or less useless. They are among Japan's many grand 
    illusions -- still there on the scene, still floating in and out of 
    newspaper stories and so on, but entirely empty of purpose. If one could 
    imagine such a thing, they are "virtual" unions. 
    <P>What is at issue here? The above account touches on many contentious 
    questions. There is acrimonious debate among scholars, writers, and 
    journalists as to the prewar history of labor, the occupation, the reverse 
    course, and the nature of the purges of the late 1940s. We should not be 
    distracted by these matters. It is not important -- not here -- whether one 
    favors unions, whether one believes that unions were subverted by "reds," or 
    whether one accepts that ends justified means during the Cold War. The issue 
    is omission. 
    <P>The standard presentation of relations between labor and management gives 
    us a placid image without accounting for how the placidity came to be. It 
    leaves out the discord -- indeed, the violence -- that produced the apparent 
    harmony we see today. It leaves out the possibility that the workplace 
    consensus we are encouraged to admire has not been achieved happily or does 
    not actually exist beneath the surface of things. In short, it leaves out 
    history and human complexity, by which we could have learned something about 
    the Japanese. 
    <P>Most of all, standard accounts of Japan leave out evidence of the 
    enduring desire of ordinary Japanese for individual autonomy, that is, for 
    an existence free of the humiliating paternalism that persists as a 
    pervasive feature of Japanese society. It is a glaring omission, for this 
    desire and the suppression of it have been near the center of Japanese life 
    from the beginning of the nation's modern era. the chrysanthemum club was 
    high among the Cold War establishment's intellectual appendages, a major 
    producer of the victory culture that animated the American century. In the 
    age of witch-hunts its perspective prevailed without serious challenge, so 
    eclipsing the worthy work of entire generations. After a time it became 
    dangerous to question the new orthodoxy. Scholars were inhibited from 
    pursuing any analysis that conflicted with the paradigm, for to dwell upon 
    Japan's complexities, or the paradigm's inconsistencies, was to face that 
    dreaded condemnation of the Cold War years: It was to be "political." The 
    intellectual chicanery of the era has thus discolored an entire country's 
    understanding of Japan, for many were those who, braving the prevailing 
    wind, found themselves forced from jobs, institutions, and communities. 
    <P>The most tragic case concerned the Canadian writer and diplomat E. H. 
    Norman, surely the seminal Japan scholar of his generation. Norman, more 
    than anyone else, was responsible for the understanding of Japan the 
    Chrysanthemum Club was dedicated to erasing -- a complex, altogether human 
    Japan with no stock characters or easy notions of "tradition," a Japan with 
    many serious problems, in need of the drastic change of course the Japanese 
    wanted after the defeat. Norman's analysis rested on history; indeed, it was 
    in Norman's work before the war that much of Japan's authentic modern 
    history was recovered. Norman was respected on both sides of the Pacific. 
    Then his work was labeled, summarily and unfairly, "Marxist." In 1951 he was 
    denounced in Senate hearings as a communist. And as Reischauer and other 
    scholars stood silently by, Norman was driven to suicide six years later. 
    <P>There were always scholars, a beleaguered few, who wrote against the 
    paradigm. Yet the single serious threat to it, at least until the Cold War 
    ended, came not from Western professors but from ordinary Japanese. It 
    occurred in the summer of 1960, when the treaty binding Japan to the 
    American security system was to be renewed. The treaty is abbreviated in 
    Japanese as AMPO. The events surrounding the renewal of AMPO are worth 
    recalling, for it was the anti-AMPO movement, which was immense, that 
    implicitly challenged the paradigm in the simplest of ways: It showed how 
    little the new imagery had to do with the Japanese as they really were. 
    <P>The man at the center of the AMPO crisis was named Nobusuke Kishi. 
    Elected premier in 1957, Kishi seems to have been a prime recipient of the 
    C.I.A.'s political funds. Who, precisely, was Kishi? The question is 
    interesting because America's dealings with him were an insult not only to 
    the Japanese, but to every American who fought in the Pacific war or 
    sacrificed for it at home. If Washington had purposely sought out an emblem 
    of all that was repulsive in imperial Japan, it could not have made a better 
    choice. 
    <P>To put the matter simply, Kishi was a war criminal and a thug. During the 
    1930s, when Japan occupied Manchuria, Kishi was the second-ranked civilian 
    in the colonial administration. In Hideki Tojo's wartime cabinet he held the 
    industry portfolio and served, in addition, as vice-minister for munitions. 
    He was, nonetheless, described by Joseph Grew, Washington's prewar 
    ambassador and a prominent figure in the Tokyo lobby at the war's end, as 
    "one of my highly valued friends in Japan." Kishi, it seems, let Grew out of 
    prison to play golf in 1942, before Washington and Tokyo exchanged 
    diplomats. 
    <P>As an "A" list war criminal according to the international postwar 
    classification, Kishi was held in Sugamo prison after the defeat, but the 
    occupation released him (along with a number of others) at the end of 1948. 
    No public explanation for this move was ever offered, though its place in 
    the reverse course can hardly be disputed. Kishi then began a steady march 
    toward the premiership, backed by postwar Japan's least-savory collection of 
    unreconstructed fascists, Sugamo alumni, and yakuza crime bosses. Kishi 
    brought many of his cronies into national politics with him. His 
    administration, indeed, marked the consolidation of the prewar nationalists' 
    future in Japanese politics. Kishi himself remained an influential figure in 
    Nagatacho until his death in 1987. 
    <P>In June of 1957, the just-elected Kishi visited the United States. He 
    golfed with President Eisenhower and addressed both houses of Congress. He 
    traveled to New York, met with senior Wall Street financiers, and tossed out 
    a ball at a Yankee game. It was shortly after this visit, the scholar 
    Michael Schaller wrote recently, that the C.I.A. appears to have begun 
    sending Kishi covert funds. Three years later it was Kishi, more than any 
    other Japanese, who made sure the AMPO treaty was renewed. 
    <P>All of Japan knew the AMPO question was a crossroads. The country could 
    either go on as it had since the war, under strict American tutelage, or it 
    could declare the postwar era over and find its own way. In the Diet and 
    among voters there was widespread opposition to the AMPO treaty. The 
    pacifism of the postwar constitution had sunk deep roots. People did not 
    want Japan to continue as America's Cold War partner; neither did they care 
    to sacrifice sovereignty any longer to a victor that had brought back the 
    prewar regime while pretending to purge it. Nonetheless, Kishi signed a new 
    version of the treaty at the White House in January of 1960, Eisenhower 
    looking happily on. By the following May, when the Diet was due to ratify 
    the pact, the entire nation was absorbed by the AMPO issue -- much of it 
    mobilized against the treaty's extension. 
    <P>Kishi brought the Diet to the brink of rioting, for he had a self-imposed 
    deadline. He wanted the treaty signed into law before Eisenhower visited 
    Japan in June. Impatient with lengthy debates, Kishi eventually ordered 
    police to carry opposing politicians out of the legislative chamber. Then he 
    railroaded through a renewal vote in his adversaries' absence. It was a 
    messy, undignified scene all around. Kishi's forced vote was legal, but it 
    sat badly with a population that knew him as a wartime bureaucrat imprisoned 
    after the surrender. It also looked as if the Liberal Democrats were more 
    concerned with pleasing Washington than with honoring the wishes of the 
    electorate. 
    <P>Kishi's vote prompted protests all over the country. Several hundred 
    thousand people ringed the Diet building in Tokyo. Eleven days before 
    Eisenhower was to arrive a military helicopter had to rescue his press 
    secretary from demonstrators who surrounded his car as it made its way in 
    from the airport. Soon after, amid violent clashes between demonstrators and 
    rightists recruited by the government, Tokyo canceled Eisenhower's visit. It 
    would have been an embarrassment for America, anyway: By then Kishi had 
    organized security that would have made the president's visit look like a 
    military maneuver. There were command posts, first-aid squads, aircraft 
    units, eighteen thousand policemen, and twice that number of 
    ultranationalists and yakuza goons. 
    <P>How many Americans today are even slightly familiar with these momentous 
    events? And how should we understand them? What had begun as a fight over 
    Japan's place in the Cold War order was changed by the forced vote. After 
    Kishi rammed through the treaty, AMPO also became a struggle over the 
    failure of democracy in Japan -- the democracy Americans still congratulate 
    themselves for giving the Japanese. The scholar Chalmers Johnson likens the 
    anti-AMPO revolt to the Hungarian revolution of 1956, minus the tanks and 
    troops. It is a provocative comparison. An American president was unable to 
    visit the happy capital of its closest ally in the Pacific: Wasn't that, 
    indeed, a scene from the Soviet satellites? Didn't the Liberal Democrats, in 
    ignoring the will of their own people, behave just as the pro-Moscow 
    communists in Budapest who crushed the uprising of ordinary Hungarians? 
    Without meaning to, Johnson raises an even more compelling question. Why is 
    it that Americans must resort to the history of Soviet misdeeds in Eastern 
    Europe to understand their own postwar conduct elsewhere on the globe? If we 
    reflect upon this even briefly, the answer does not seem so elusive as one 
    might think. Doesn't it reveal the extent to which Americans have been 
    mesmerized by the myths of their victory culture? 
    <P>Nineteen sixty was a watershed not only for Japan, but also for our idea 
    of Japan. We can consider it today as the year America's "Japan" was 
    formally launched. A few days after the AMPO treaty became law Premier Kishi 
    was replaced by Hayato Ikeda, another leftover from the wartime bureaucracy, 
    whose mission it was to take people's minds off the troublesome matters of 
    democracy, sovereignty, and world politics. Ikeda promptly instituted 
    another program every Japanese, alive at the time or not, recognizes as a 
    postwar turning point. It was called the Income-Doubling Plan. It was 
    devised to give as many Japanese as possible a material interest in 
    arrangements as they were. It may look today like a bribe, and it was -- 
    partly. But it was more in the way of an offer the Japanese could not 
    refuse. 
    <P>The reverse course, the Yoshida deal, and the 1955 system had prepared 
    the ground well for this moment. The Ikeda plan produced a kind of madness 
    -- the madness of material growth at any human or environmental cost, of a 
    ruling party whose sole task was good relations with America; the madness of 
    a mutant democracy in which elections function to deprive voters of their 
    democratic rights. Thereafter, production and consumption were everything. 
    Ikeda also invented the notion of consensus politics. His slogan was 
    "Tolerance and Patience." Everything was to be done by common agreement 
    after 1960. Of course, tolerance and patience changed nothing in Nagatacho; 
    they meant only that the opposition took its place at the table on the 
    understanding that power would never change hands. The Liberal Democrats 
    could still pass any law they wanted, as the treaty vote had proven. 
    Consensus was advanced as a traditional Japanese value, but it was really 
    nothing more than another word for the disguised power of the political 
    brokers who controlled Nagatacho. 
    <P>Ikeda's plan succeeded admirably, at least on its own terms: The average 
    salary doubled in seven years, three short of the goal. So began the era of 
    Japan Inc., the name we gave to the obsessed nation we created. It was 
    almost as if America had chosen Ikeda for office, for he did much to produce 
    the country America wanted Japan to be. "High exports through hard work," 
    Kennan's prescient phrase in N.S.C. 13/2, was fixed as the national ethos. 
    All at once Japan became a mass society, a corporate society, and a 
    management society (that is, one planned and controlled by a technocratic 
    elite, like a business). But it was no longer a society capable of managing 
    the democratic process, or even of sensible decisions, for Hayato Ikeda put 
    Japan to sleep as a civic society. So it was that the Diet assumed the 
    lifeless gait and the taste for immense corruption that have been its 
    hallmarks ever since. 
    <P>Edwin Reischauer visited Japan shortly after the AMPO crisis. At an 
    academic conference in Hakone, a resort district south of Tokyo, he and 
    other scholars elevated the paradigm to the level of doctrine. Thereafter it 
    was known as "modernization theory," which assumed as truth the ideas 
    Reischauer and a few other Americans had been advancing for years: Japan was 
    a place of contented conformity, and the Japanese had handily regained the 
    democratic track after a few misguided nationalists, now banished, 
    temporarily diverted them. Gradualism in all matters was the obvious 
    prescription. The only way forward, anywhere on the globe, was the Western 
    way. For its naivete (or cynicism, perhaps) and all-around inaccuracy, the 
    new orthodoxy astonished the Japanese scholars at Hakone. But a few months 
    after Reischauer returned to Cambridge the new American president, John 
    Kennedy, named him ambassador to Tokyo. Kennedy no doubt had the revolt 
    against AMPO in view when he chose the professor from Harvard. And in 
    appointing Reischauer he presided over the formal marriage of American 
    scholarship to Cold War ideology. 
    <P>In his later memoir, My Life Between Japan and America, Reischauer made 
    short work of these matters. He could not comprehend the vehemence of 
    Japanese attacks upon modernization theory, he wrote. The idea of 
    modernization theory was a fabrication in the first place; there was never 
    any such thing. The Japanese scholars, in any event, were all "Marxists" -- 
    Reischauer loved the term -- whose "deeply entrenched Marxist concepts" led 
    them to misunderstand their own country: Americans understood it better. As 
    to the anti-AMPO movement, that was a misunderstanding, too. Resurrected war 
    criminals like Kishi were no problem; the problem was the Japanese people, 
    who lived and labored in the dark: 
    <P>Many Japanese . . . felt helpless and resentful in their dependence on 
    the United States. . . . They feared that America's adventuristic foreign 
    policy, as they perceived it, combined with American nuclear power would 
    involve Japan in a new tragedy. They saw themselves as being at the mercy of 
    American callousness and political folly. Although they believed that they 
    had no choice but to remain economically dependent on trade with America, 
    they wished to distance themselves politically as much as they could from 
    United States foreign policy. . . . 
    <P>It was necessary for the Japanese to realize that the United States was 
    not an inherently aggressive, militaristic country, but that it had to 
    maintain some military strength in the Western Pacific. . . . 
    <P>It would be Reischauer's task as ambassador to correct "all these 
    distorted concepts," as he put it in his memoir. He never entertained the 
    idea that the Japanese, even if they were wrong, had a right to their 
    mistakes. Or that they well understood the circumstances under which they 
    lived -- and how they arrived at them -- and that they simply did not wish 
    to host America's Pacific forces or continue living as they had for all but 
    a very few years after their defeat. 
    <P>Reischauer served in Tokyo for six years. We now know he helped plan the 
    subversion of at least one election, in Okinawa, and it is difficult to 
    accept that as the extent of his illegal activity. Reischauer never fooled 
    the Japanese about the Americans. From his day to ours they have held to a 
    hard-nosed understanding of the bargain with America, the old Yoshida deal, 
    which is one reason Tokyo appears to be so relentlessly obstinate today in 
    matters such as trade. But the professor from Harvard was a resounding 
    success in fooling Americans about the Japanese. This can be measured by our 
    failure to understand Japan's official behavior toward us, or by the ease 
    with which we dismiss ordinary Japanese as conformist robots or "economic 
    animals" with no interest and no pride in anything other than production and 
    export. 
    <P>The Japanese went through a long period after the war with the pervasive 
    feeling that they were ugly. People who lived through the defeat will 
    sometimes still mention this in passing. One also finds vestiges of a time 
    of profound self-rejection in ordinary expressions. Nihonjin banare shiteiru 
    -- you look different from a Japanese -- was a common compliment among young 
    women well into the 1980s. A poignant sense of inadequacy dates to Japan's 
    first modern contacts with the West in the last century. But defeat in 1945 
    intensified it dramatically. The Japanese wanted somehow to disappear after 
    the war. And the Americans invited them to do so, to efface themselves 
    before the world, with the idea that they were not nationalists but 
    internationalists. 
    <P>"Thus, the Japanese, not long ago one of the most militaristic peoples of 
    the world, have now become ardent champions of internationalism," Edwin 
    Reischauer wrote after the war. "Some may doubt the sincerity of this sudden 
    conversion, but it is not difficult to understand in a people entirely at 
    the mercy of foreign military powers and completely dependent on trade with 
    the outside world." 
    <P>Reischauer's reasoning worked well for the Chrysanthemum Club. For 
    example, it excused orthodox scholars from engaging the thorny question of 
    wartime coercion on the part of Washington's new friends in Tokyo. But as a 
    piece of logic it is a little preposterous. The Japanese were not a 
    militaristic people, any more than any other ever was or will be. They 
    suffered under a militarist regime over which they had no control. Neither 
    does Reischauer's conclusion stand up to scrutiny. It is precisely those at 
    the mercy of others whose sincerity must be questioned. Only those who 
    willingly supported the dictatorship could be considered candidates for 
    conversion. And many of them did not convert; in the reverse course 
    Americans allowed them merely to bury their sentiments or reinterpret them. 
    <P>By embracing internationalism the Japanese were supposed to have 
    repudiated any claim they may have made to nationalism. It is true that the 
    pacifism and neutrality popular after the war remain so today. But that is 
    not the same as professing internationalism to the point of giving up one's 
    national pride and identity, even for a people who wanted to disappear out 
    of self-loathing. To be internationalist instead of nationalist: This is a 
    false equation, commonly proposed. It has left the Japanese themselves 
    confused and inarticulate as to their place in the world and the meaning of 
    the awkward but often used term "Japaneseness." And so it escapes us that 
    beneath its calm surface Japan still suffers the same restlessness and 
    unease that was evident until the summer of 1960. 
    <P>If we are to understand Japan today, and what Japan is likely to become, 
    we must recognize that this restlessness has reemerged, as inevitably it 
    would. To put it another way, the Japanese have come to realize that it is 
    impossible to disappear from the face of the earth, or to make the bogus 
    exchange of nationalism for internationalism. Or another way again: the 
    Japanese are outgrowing their feelings of ugliness and inferiority in 
    comparison with others. And these realizations that have now led them to 
    begin redefining themselves. 
    <P>Among the curiosities of modern Japan are the many slogans it has 
    produced. They are like capsule philosophies, rich in meaning. Fukoku 
    kyohei, wealthy nation, strong defense; wakon yosai, Japanese spirit, 
    Western things; bunmei kaika, civilization and enlightenment: These were 
    some of the phrases Japan used to describe itself when it began to 
    modernize, and each one stood for an idea. During the war the dictatorship 
    exhorted the populace with "Desirelessly on to victory," a telling 
    admonition to suppress the self for the sake of the state. In the late 1980s 
    Japan invented a slogan in a single word: kokusaika, internationalization. 
    It was a complicated notion, never well explained, but it, too, gave an 
    insight into the age. 
    <P>It was difficult to tell what kokusaika meant when bureaucrats, scholars, 
    and television commentators used the term. It was supposed to mean nothing 
    less than the reinvention of the national ethos. Somehow, Japan Inc. would 
    be decommissioned: The Japanese would work less, export less, and consume 
    more of other people's products. They would take a greater part in world 
    affairs. But these were rather large projects: Japan Inc., after all, could 
    not be discarded just because some Japanese decided they were finished with 
    certain aspects of it. That would require American dispensation. In any 
    case, there were too many definitions of kokusaika and too little agreement 
    as to its true meaning. How would Japan internationalize? What would it mean 
    to the rest of us? 
    <P>Japan stammered for a simple reason. "Internationalization" was the wrong 
    word. Japan was trying to articulate a revived nationalism it feared the 
    world (especially its neighbors and the Americans) would not accept. Along 
    with "internationalization" came other notions -- less often discussed but 
    more to the point: "soft nationalism," "resurgent cultural nationalism," 
    "prudent revivalist nationalism." And along with these came Japan's arrival 
    on the world's economic stage. In the mid-1980s the yen began a climb in 
    value that put it among the world's strongest currencies. At home, interest 
    rates were dropped to record lows, which quickly produced the "bubble 
    economy," a five-year period of high but frothy, speculative growth. The 
    Tokyo stock market tripled in value. Land prices doubled in a year -- and 
    then doubled again the next year. The bubble brought the Japanese into the 
    world's real estate markets, resorts, and auction rooms. Investors bought 
    Hollywood studios and trophy properties such as Rockefeller Center. Japan 
    became the largest aid donor and number one source of credit. At economic 
    summits the world began to bow in Tokyo's direction. Can anyone doubt that 
    these events were a form of national self-assertion -- that the Japanese, so 
    to say, were making themselves visible again? 
    <P>In certain ways the late 1980s resembled a party, as many Westerners who 
    lived in Tokyo during those years understood. And like most parties, it was 
    an occasion for both remembering and forgetting. The Japanese remembered 
    nothing less than themselves. At home and abroad, they grew more confident 
    -- as a nation and as individuals. They began to assert themselves 
    politically for the first time since the anti-AMPO protests of 1960. But in 
    the intoxication of the time they forgot about their larger circumstances. 
    They forgot the immense influence America still exercised over Japan. They 
    forgot that Japan had placed its faith in efficiency and technology, not 
    democracy, and that reversing that decision was their greatest challenge. 
    They forgot, too, that all the property deals in the world would not change 
    the fact that Japan was a nation that had "power without purpose" -- a 
    phrase that was famous by the decade's end. 
    <P>The bubble lost its air in 1990, when Japan tumbled into recession. But 
    something more abrupt than an economic downturn brought the Japanese back to 
    sobriety. On August 2, 1990, Iraqi forces invaded Kuwait. And when the 
    United States began gathering international support for a military response 
    to Saddam Hussein, the Persian Gulf became a critical moment for Japan. What 
    was Japan to do within its constitutional constraints, which exclude it from 
    collective security actions? As much to the point, what did Japan want to 
    do? As Tokyo dithered, Washington grew shrill. Japanese leaders looked like 
    fools -- at least from America's perspective. They sent no soldiers to the 
    Persian Gulf -- no troops, no supplies, no ships until it was too late. 
    Japan eventually pledged $13 billion and got more criticism than thanks for 
    it. Twenty-nine nations contributed to the Persian Gulf effort; Washington 
    gave twenty-eight of them regular progress briefings during the assault and 
    pride of place at the celebrations that came afterward. 
    <P>There was singular irony in this obvious snub -- the irony of America's 
    blindness to the history Americans themselves made. No one seemed to 
    remember the old Yoshida deal, or that Japan's place in the Western security 
    alliance had been imposed upon it. It never seemed to occur to anyone in 
    Washington that Tokyo's fumbled response was partly the consequence of a 
    document Americans wrote for the Japanese and then made law. And it was a 
    measure of Tokyo's long habit of deference that no Japanese official ever 
    pointed these things out. 
    <P>The memory of those months will be long in fading among the Japanese. The 
    Persian Gulf crisis suddenly ended the party of the late 1980s, the dream 
    that Japan would never have to face the tasks of dismantling the Yoshida 
    deal, rethinking the notion of internationalism, and becoming -- the phrase 
    was soon universal -- "a normal nation." 
    <P>The chrysanthemum club is still with us. It is now supported, vigorously 
    and generously, by Japanese institutions. There is a Mitsubishi chair of law 
    at Harvard and a Toyota chair of anthropology at the University of Michigan, 
    among numerous other endowments like them. The Japanese spend many millions 
    on such positions, which are almost invariably occupied by the geisha of the 
    Chrysanthemum Club. Geisha still direct Japanese studies in many of our most 
    esteemed universities, not just Harvard, and as the scholar Chalmers Johnson 
    once pointed out, "You never have to tell a geisha what to do." 
    <P>The Berlin Wall was a year in ruins when the Gulf War broke out. Saddam 
    Hussein's invasion was a mere taste of the complex new world Japan, along 
    with the rest of us, entered when the Cold War ended. Products of the Cold 
    War, the Chrysanthemum Club and its "Japan" could never survive the end of 
    it. Neither could the postwar political elite in Tokyo, janitors of our 
    Orientalist creation. The Tokyo political landscape has changed forever 
    since the late 1980s. Yet our postwar images linger, partly as a matter of 
    inertia. We will eventually have to examine all our old assumptions if we 
    are not to drift dangerously far from reality. But inertia, especially when 
    it is rooted in a fear of change, can be a considerable force. 
    <P>At the brink of the Cold War's end the Chrysanthemum Club was openly 
    challenged for the first time in many years. It was the challenge of 
    journalists and scholars known as the revisionists. They were (and remain) a 
    loose group; on many questions they are far from universal agreement. None 
    among them especially likes the revisionist label (as members of the 
    Chrysanthemum Club did not like theirs). But they are legitimately bound by 
    a simple assumption: The paradigm is false; the West should reassess the way 
    it looks at Japan. 
    <P>It is time to recognize, the revisionists said, that Japan is different 
    from America and other industrial nations. At least as it is presented, it 
    is a model of nothing. It has assumed the trappings of democracy but does 
    not function as one. Its institutions do not serve the purposes we think 
    they do. The government is not merely a regulator -- an arbiter, as in the 
    West; it is an advocate. It plays an active role in the economy, with 
    defined social and economic goals, as governments do in many Third World 
    countries. Chalmers Johnson, best known of the revisionists and a scholar 
    who has devoted his career to Chinese and Japanese studies, coined a new 
    term for the Japanese system: He called it a "capitalist developmental 
    state" -- a creature unknown until postwar Japan came along. 
    <P>The revisionists detonated an explosion with another simple idea: If 
    Japan is different it should be treated differently. As revisionism spread 
    into newspapers and magazines, this assertion was immediately applied to 
    matters of trade. Suddenly America could understand its chronic deficit with 
    Japan, for it could dispense with the fiction that, apart from a few 
    specific problems, the Japanese were free-market capitalists, just like the 
    rest of us. The problem was systemic: Japan was closed, by virtue of 
    numerous visible and invisible mechanisms, because Japan's political and 
    business leaders liked it that way. And it would not open until the West 
    forced it open -- a task left chiefly to the Americans. 
    <P>Revisionism arrived like fresh air in a windowless room. It was an act of 
    creative destruction in that it began the work of dismantling the postwar 
    paradigm. It bore no ideological load, no Cold War imperative, so that it 
    made the prospect of clear sight at last realistic. Revisionism held much 
    appeal for ordinary Japanese, who stood to benefit greatly from an economic 
    system stripped of some of its elaborate controls. Not surprisingly, the 
    Japanese elite quickly labeled the revisionists "Japan bashers," a term 
    whose sole purpose was to preclude open discussion of the institutions whose 
    levers they pushed and pulled. 
    <P>Revisionism has had a considerable impact in America. The old picture of 
    Japan advanced by the Chrysanthemum Club is scarcely credible now. That it 
    continues to be taught in American universities is faintly ridiculous. It is 
    a vestige. Washington and Tokyo still guard the wall between trade and 
    security that they erected after the war. But this artificial distinction is 
    now under threat -- as it should be, for that is a vestige, too. 
    <P>The revisionist version of Japan has also begun to sway ordinary 
    Americans -- though not always in so favorable a direction. In the early 
    1990s we suddenly decided we were confronted with another version of the 
    "evil empire." As the Soviet Union collapsed, there was serious talk that 
    Japan would replace it as public enemy number one. All that remained was how 
    Americans could protect themselves from the conspiring country across the 
    Pacific. 
    <P>Such notions have a long history. For more than a century America has 
    swung like a pendulum in its views of Japan. A hundred years ago we wondered 
    how long it would take before the primitive but innocent Japanese would 
    become Christian and democratic. Then came the yellow peril, when the 
    Japanese were cast as predatory militarists with a love of the sword deep in 
    their souls. During the war they were simply "beasts" -- Harry Truman's 
    judgment. Then they became diffident workaholics. And here we were again, 
    hatching conspiracy theories. Suddenly, nothing happened by accident in 
    Japan. Narita, Tokyo's international airport, was not big enough because 
    Japan wanted to limit the influx of foreigners and the foreign travel of the 
    Japanese. Japan did not enter a recession in the early 1990s: It was 
    "blindsiding" us, a sort of sneak attack, the better to achieve economic 
    domination. This view has receded precisely because Japan has been in 
    recession, but it is likely to return as soon as our trade problems do. 
    <P>Revisionism is partly to blame for this sort of paranoia -- if not its 
    originators, then those who made the revisionist perspective popular. What 
    went wrong? Why did revisionism not mark the beginning of a genuine 
    understanding of the Japanese -- and so the end of the stories spun around 
    various "Japan's"? 
    <P>The revisionists' faults had something to do with their timing. When they 
    appeared Japan had just finished a quarter of a century of gray, monotonous 
    stability, during which nothing seemed to change. Of course, there is no 
    such thing as a static society -- it is a human impossibility. On this point 
    the revisionists should have learned from that other eternally unchanging 
    nation, the Soviet Union. Instead, at the very moment everything was to 
    begin changing, they posited a nation incapable of movement. 
    <P>Most of all, the revisionists' advocates displayed little understanding 
    of history. They seemed unaware of the extent to which America was 
    responsible for the "Japan" that was suddenly so threatening. Every 
    important component of Japan's postwar economic machine was in place by the 
    end of the occupation, in 1952. M.I.T.I., the demonized Ministry of 
    International Trade and Industry? Up and running precisely one day before 
    the first allied soldiers arrived in Tokyo, in 1945, and its bureaucrats 
    have never looked back. Targeted industries -- ships, steel, electronics, 
    cars? The policy to concentrate resources in them began under the Americans 
    in 1947. It was called "priority production" then; the only thing the 
    Americans did not like was the name. 
    <P>One of the terms that came up often in the late 1980s was gaiatsu, which 
    translates as "outside pressure." There was nothing new about gaiatsu, but 
    the term was current then because gaiatsu seemed the only way things got 
    done in Japan. Outside pressure almost always meant pressure from the 
    Americans. Washington would demand, say, an open market for beef or baseball 
    bats. Tokyo would resist until the last moment, when it would present the 
    case to the Japanese public as "inevitable" -- so relieving itself of 
    responsibility. 
    <P>Gaiatsu is indeed how many things got done in Japan. But what kind of 
    relationship does gaiatsu imply? Is it one that does credit to either side 
    -- or does it diminish both? More, does it represent a long-term solution to 
    the problems Japan has in its relations with America and the rest of the 
    world, or is it, at the core, Orientalist? Gaiatsu was much favored by many 
    revisionists and still is, which brings us to their most basic mistake. Like 
    the Chrysanthemum Club, many revisionists failed to acknowledge Japan's 
    complexity and humanity. Instead, they took Japan to be the Japan of its 
    institutions -- the Japan of the center, the Liberal Democratic, corporate, 
    consensual Japan America did so much to create. This is the Japan Kenzaburo 
    Oe described -- an "official" Japan made of samurai tradition and 
    efficiency. And it is a mistake for any of us to accept it at face value. 
    <P>Oe drew a fundamental distinction when he talked about the other Japan, 
    the "blank where the Japanese live." By this he meant a Japan that is more 
    authentic but less familiar to us in the West. It is a country of ordinary 
    people with ordinary desires, people neither more nor less efficient than 
    anyone else, neither more nor less individual, neither more nor less given 
    to feudal arts and formality. Borrowing terms from Buddhist history and 
    bending them, we call the familiar, official Japan the Japan of "the great 
    tradition." Beneath it is the Japan of "the little tradition," the Japan we 
    do not easily discern. 
    <P>The difference between the two is very old. In one form or another it is 
    no doubt universal. But nowhere has it been so influential for so long as in 
    Japan. For as long as Japan has recorded its history there has been 
    antagonism between the great and the little, the refined "above" and the 
    ordinary "below." The famous saying of the late feudal period was "Revere 
    officials, despise the people." This crude notion survived into the Meiji 
    era as a clear line drawn between kan and min, officials and commoners, and 
    it is not absent, to put it mildly, in Japan today. There is one other point 
    worth noting: The great tradition has always reflected what Japan has 
    borrowed from abroad. It is, then, an imposed import, while the little 
    tradition has always been by nature indigenous. 
    <P>The conflict between the great and the little is rarely explained in our 
    mainstream accounts of Japan. Yet it is the coiled spring of Japanese 
    history. It is as evident today as at any time in the past, and it will 
    inform the rest of this book. To grasp it, at least in a general way, is 
    essential to improving our understanding of Japan and the Japanese. 
    <P>Consider again the matter of protectionism. We have always taken Tokyo's 
    protectionist trade policies to reflect the nation's essential ethos -- its 
    xenophobic mentality, its dislike of the foreign. Assuming protectionism 
    enjoys universal support, we view it as a problem of "the Japanese." It has 
    never been so simple. Who and what do Japanese policies protect? Is it 
    ordinary Japanese people or the Japanese system, the bureaucrats and 
    ministries at the center of Japan. Had this been considered, American might 
    have thought better of gaiatsu. Gaiatsu does nothing to alter the system, 
    and the system is the problem -- for the Japanese as well as for us. 
    <P>Because the revisionists, or most of them, did not make the distinction 
    between the great and the little, they did not see that America's problems 
    with Japan were merely symptoms of more fundamental problems, many of which 
    America either caused or prolonged. And they exhibited no confidence in the 
    ability of the Japanese to alter their nation's course by themselves. Isn't 
    this, in a new form, the same mistake Westerners have made since they first 
    arrived, in 1542 -- the essential mistake of all Orientalists -- that is, 
    the failure to allow the Japanese their own past, their own history? late in 
    1995, three American soldiers stationed in Okinawa, Japan's southernmost 
    prefecture, molested a twelve-year-old girl outside their base. Two admitted 
    to abduction, the third to rape. (In the end a Japanese court sentenced all 
    three to roughly seven years.) A gruesome crime in any circumstance, the 
    incident set off a storm in America's relations with Japan that went far 
    beyond the conduct of guests in another country. Three G.I.'s on a night off 
    managed to put the entire postwar security system back on the table between 
    Tokyo and Washington. 
    <P>In this the incident was reminiscent of the AMPO upheaval thirty-five 
    years earlier. The question soon became the American military presence as a 
    whole -- the core of the Yoshida deal. What were so many Americans doing in 
    Japan? More accustomed to foreigners and less influenced by Japanese 
    tradition, Okinawans are more direct than Japanese of the main islands. This 
    was an unfortunate accident of history for the Americans. For the protests 
    of Okinawans made it evident once again that change between Japan and 
    America is, sooner or later, inevitable. 
    <P>It is not easy to hide almost fifty thousand troops from public view for 
    nearly half a century -- especially when thirty thousand of them operate 
    seventy separate military facilities, spread over a fifth of usable land, as 
    is the case in Okinawa. For a long time Washington and Tokyo did a thorough 
    job of hiding these soldiers from Americans and was pretty good at keeping 
    them out of sight in Japan. That was one reason three-quarters of the 
    American bases in Japan were concentrated in the country's most distant 
    prefecture. And it is why the rape incident once again challenged our simple 
    idea of Japan and of how we have conducted ourselves there. In its way 
    Okinawa was another signal of "the end of victory culture," as the writer 
    Tom Engelhardt titled the book that gave us this useful phrase. 
    <P>Fifty years ago we interrupted the Japanese. We defeated them, of course, 
    and, in a time we briefly provided for them, they took their first tentative 
    steps toward resolving the tragedy their modernization had come to. Then we 
    decided to delay such resolution -- a delay that has lasted five decades. If 
    we are to make our relationship a healthy one, we must now do what we failed 
    to do a half century ago -- stand aside -- and what the first Westerners in 
    Japan failed to do five centuries ago: look at the Japanese only for what 
    they are. 
    <P>The first thing we discover about them, ironically, is that they are 
    accustomed to hiding -- from themselves as well as others. Every Japanese 
    wears a mask, or so each one is taught. And within their masks the Japanese 
    have learned to live close to one another by living far apart. But beneath 
    the placid, unchanging surface of Japan's oddly vacant, undecided present 
    are countless conflicts, tensions, crosscurrents, and anxieties. They have 
    always been there. They have merely become more apparent now, as if a lid 
    were lifted, or a mask partially removed. 
    <P>In Masks, the novelist Fumiko Enchi described her antagonist as 
    possessing an "indestructible face." One of the essential questions the 
    Japanese have begun to ask themselves -- one posed in this book -- is 
    whether their masks are indestructible, too, or whether it is time to live 
    without them.

    <P>
    <UL>Look closely and you will see what an enormous variety of human types 
      are represented in the huge crowd.<BR>-- Shimei Futabatei, Drifting 
      Clouds, 1889</UL>
    <P>In kanazawa, a city on the Sea of Japan noted for its old samurai 
    quarter, there is a family that traces its ancestors back four centuries. 
    Their name is Meboso, and they have made sewing needles and fishhooks for 
    nineteen generations. 
    <P>The Meboso's are as proud of their uncommon name as they are of their 
    craft, for the two cannot be separated. "Meboso" comes from meboso-bari, 
    narrow-eyed needle. In the sixteenth century their skill was such that the 
    local daimyo, the feudal lord, let them take a surname and carry swords. "An 
    unusual honor," Tadayoshi Meboso said when he explained this to me. "Almost 
    no one of our status could have a name or own a sword." Today the Meboso's 
    sell fly-fishing gear, along with boxes of tailor's needles, from the same 
    shop they have run since 1575. It is on Meboso-dori -- Meboso Avenue. 
    <P>It was hardly unusual for people under feudal rule to have only a given 
    name and to be identified according to their village or some other obvious 
    attribute. But where else among the advanced countries is this point of a 
    family name still important, still dwelt upon in casual conversation? 
    <P>The feudal past is near in Japan. Until late in the last century only 
    daimyo and samurai, and an exceptional few like the Meboso's, had family 
    names. Everyone else was nameless. Allowing everyone a surname was among the 
    early reforms of the Meiji era, Japan's great period of modernization, which 
    began in 1868. It is because names were so recently granted that many still 
    correspond to villages or rural features. Kurokawa: Blackriver; Ishibashi: 
    Stonebridge. 
    <P>What is to be learned from the simple historical fact that the 
    great-grandparents of many Japanese alive today had no names? Seeing Japan 
    as a group society, we conclude that there was no notion of individuality 
    among the Japanese until a few generations before our own. No individuality, 
    and for the vast majority no history -- just as the serfs of feudal Europe 
    lived out lives as unrecorded as the lives of farm animals. 
    <P>Such reasoning is logical enough. It is a commonplace that the Japanese 
    are given to groups. No matter what version of Japan one subscribes to, it 
    is likely to include the assumption that the individual's worth and power 
    are secondary to the worth of the collective, whether it is a village, a 
    baseball team, or a corporation. History offers abundant evidence to support 
    this idea. The fact that the Japanese were nameless until little more than a 
    century ago is but one of numerous examples. 
    <P>But this is a misreading. For the group is a kind of fiction in Japan. It 
    is within the group that the Japanese put on their masks. To assume a mask 
    is to assume a role -- a public, designated role in the group. The masks of 
    the Japanese are also masks of sameness. By wearing them, the Japanese 
    signify to themselves that there are no differences among them, and that 
    having no differences is part of what it means to be Japanese. 
    <P>One of the first Westerners to live in Japan, a Jesuit called João 
    Rodrigues, seems to have understood the Japanese mask uncannily well. 
    Rodrigues arrived in 1576, around the time the Meboso's got their name, and 
    remained more than thirty years. He was fluent in the language and 
    eventually translated for the shogun. The Japanese have three hearts, 
    Rodrigues surmised: "a false one in their mouths for all the world to see, 
    another within their breasts only for their friends, and the third in the 
    depths of their hearts, reserved for themselves alone and never manifested 
    to anyone." 
    <P>To wear a mask among others: Is there a better measure of how thoroughly 
    the individual is effaced, of how well the Japanese personality learned to 
    peek out through the reed screen of a purposely blank expression that hides 
    the true face from public view? These habits of mind and physiology have 
    been so completely internalized that Japanese even today have difficulty 
    discussing their own ways of thinking or feeling. But a nation of effaced 
    personalities is different from one in which individual personalities -- 
    somehow, miraculously -- do not exist. 
    <P>Neither individuality nor a sense of history is missing from the 
    assumptions by which ordinary Japanese live. Nor were they absent in the 
    past. These basic aspects of human life have simply been submerged. So there 
    is a more accurate conclusion to draw from the nameless majority that lived 
    and died in Japan until a century ago. Then as now, it was not individuality 
    that was missing so much as public individuality, the open manifestation of 
    the self, the self unmasked within the group. In the same way, the Japanese 
    did not live without their own history -- no more, at least, than anyone 
    else in a feudal society. Their history was merely hidden by the society 
    that preferred them to remain nameless. 
    <P>There is a vast chasm between the simplicity arriving foreigners often 
    find in Japan and the furtive, unrevealed complexity that lies within. In 
    this space the Japanese still make their hidden history -- the record of 
    their endeavor to achieve public, unmasked individuality. the term for 
    "group" is nakama. The first character, naka, means "inside," and the 
    second, ma, refers to an enclosure in either space or time -- a room, a 
    field, an interval, a long duration. The importance not only of belonging 
    but of being hidden within can be judged from the first lines of poetry 
    Japan ever produced: 
    <P>
    <UL>Eight clouds arise.<BR>The eightfold fence of Izumo<BR>Makes an 
      eightfold fence<BR>For the spouses to retire within.<BR>Oh! that eightfold 
      fence.</UL>
    <P>These lines are about the whole of Japan. There were eight clouds and 
    eight fences because in the old chronicles Japan consisted of eight islands. 
    One still finds a suggestion of the much-treasured fence in Izumo, a coastal 
    city in southwestern Japan where an ancient god is said to have descended 
    from heaven. The Izumo shrine, Shinto's oldest, is still enclosed by a fence 
    beyond which ordinary mortals may not pass. Outside of it there are several 
    torii, the classic Shinto gates, which reveal perfectly the essential 
    abstraction of the belonging ritual. No fence ever flanks a torii. It is 
    freestanding but nonetheless alters the space around it. The outermost torii 
    at Izumo is most of a mile from the shrine along a busy commercial street. 
    Candy stores, trinket shops, and garages stretch out on either side, yet the 
    gate marks the difference between outer and inner space, the profane and 
    sacred. 
    <P>The duality of outside and inside, the enclosed and the exposed, is the 
    first thing to confront the arriving visitor. The standard term for oneself 
    is "gaijin," outside person. It is one's first notice that life in Japan 
    will consist of a series of acceptances and rejections. Nothing is excepted. 
    What is sumo, the popular wrestling tradition held to extend back to 23 
    b.c., if not a ritual celebration of the distinction made between the 
    included and excluded? The two wrestlers purify the circle where they stand 
    by dusting it with salt. They square off, squat, and stare. There is almost 
    nothing to see, for the match usually lasts no more than a minute or two, 
    and often mere seconds. What matters is the consequence. The sumo contest 
    produces not so much a winner and a loser as a change in status: The 
    vanquished is the man pushed out of the circle. 
    <P>In feudal Japan the matter of belonging came down to one's ie, or 
    household. The ie was more than a family in that those not related by blood 
    could be adopted into it. Villages were groups of ie; commercial enterprises 
    were organized as ie. The ie remained important until 1945, a building block 
    of imperial Japan. In the ie one learned to suppress the self. And all of 
    Japan was an ie, the emperor being the head of the Japanese household. The 
    prewar ideologues claimed that Japan was unique in the world because it was 
    a "family-state." 
    <P>Today the Japanese live in a universe of intersecting, constantly 
    shifting circles -- "households" made of families, schools, graduating 
    classes, universities, sports clubs, sects, social cliques, nightclub 
    regulars, companies. The list is infinite, the question of belonging 
    continuous. Alone, two people from different sections of the same 
    organization are outsiders to each other; joined by a third from another 
    organization, they become insiders, and the third is the outsider. Such 
    variations occur over and over in the course of daily life and are signified 
    in commonplace objects: not just fences and gates, but walls, bridges, banks 
    of desks, paper screens. 
    <P>Japanese is rich in its descriptions of this essential distinction. There 
    are words denoting what is outside and inside, public and private, the 
    spoken and authentic versions of the truth. One pair of these terms will be 
    useful. Omote and ura mean the explicit and the implicit, the outer and the 
    inner, the front and the back, or, more broadly, the revealed and the 
    hidden. In old Japanese they meant "face" and "mind." Today one speaks of 
    omote-dori and ura-dori, main streets and back lanes; omote-ji is kimono 
    cloth, ura-ji is kimono lining. Futo no omote is the front of an envelope; 
    ura-niwa is a back garden. These terms have numerous dimensions and, like 
    others, can be revealing. Urameshii means to feel bitter, urayamu to feel 
    envious, and urami is a grudge. None of these is an acceptable thing to 
    reveal in Japan, where the group's primary purpose is to preserve harmony 
    and the appearance of sameness. So feelings of envy and bitterness are by 
    definition ura, hidden. 
    <P>Common to the various terms for inside and outside are the values of 
    belonging versus exclusion, revelation versus concealment. What is public 
    has always been the higher social value in Japan. And what is public is 
    associated with order and the group, while what is private is individual and 
    therefore secretive, selfish, and corrupting. One may belong to a group, and 
    that group to a larger group, but the price of belonging is the subjugation 
    of the individual to the group, the private to the public, the authentic to 
    the represented. 
    <P>João Rodrigues, the Jesuit who found three hearts in the Japanese, was 
    smarter than we are in one respect. Our images of the Japanese encourage us 
    to assume that there simply is no individuality among them -- that in some 
    other than human way they are content to live, like penguins or lemmings, 
    with nothing to distinguish one from another. Rodrigues understood that the 
    individual was only obscured. But the Jesuit was wrong in another way. There 
    is nothing "false" about the faces the Japanese present to the world, not so 
    far as they are concerned, and nothing about unshared thoughts and feelings 
    that make them truer or more valuable. This is a mistake only a Westerner 
    could make, for we, like Father Rodrigues, do not share Japan's notion of 
    the group as the superior value. 
    <P>It is also true that the Japanese reserve a special place for what is 
    concealed. They are dedicated diarists for the simple reason that so much of 
    life must be hidden. One of Japan's aesthetic traditions, famously displayed 
    in a temple garden in Kyoto, is called mie gakure, the seen and unseen. In 
    the garden, fifteen stones protrude from a sea of combed gravel. But from no 
    vantage point are all of the stones visible; wherever you stand, one is 
    always hidden. In a friend's office I once saw an ink drawing of two 
    peasants pulling a harness. The harness trailed off at the edge of the 
    picture; nothing else was depicted. When I mentioned the drawing my friend 
    smiled. "Yes," he said. "Can you see the cart?" 
    <P>Mie gakure, applied to people, also means "to appear and disappear," or 
    "to hide oneself." And there is nothing the Japanese are more accustomed to 
    hiding than themselves, their inner beings. True heart, called kokoro, and 
    ninjo, human feelings, are rarely manifest but all the more precious for it. 
    Emotions are unsullied and innocent, which is why, when the Japanese expose 
    them, they appear childishly sentimental -- as, for example, when they are 
    drunk, or singing in a karaoke bar. Emotions are part of the "ura of the 
    ura," the inside of the inside, and it is because they are withheld that 
    each Japanese lives with a certain sense of crisis in his relations with the 
    outer world. 
    <P>"What is concealed is the flower," wrote Ze-ami, the fourteenth-century 
    Noh master. "What is not concealed cannot be the flower." The thought 
    survives in many contexts and is not irrelevant in this one. It is cited by 
    the psychiatrist Takeo Doi in his explorations of the Japanese personality. 
    Doi was a deeply traditional man. He believed that to live amid elaborate 
    concealments was a normal, healthy thing. And he saw no tension between the 
    security of belonging, which is undeniable among the Japanese, and the 
    individual desire to break free of the group -- which, though traditionally 
    unacknowledged, is also undeniable. "The ideal condition of the mind, the 
    condition from which mental health derives," Doi wrote in 1985, "is one in 
    which we can feel comfortable having secrets." 
    <P>The confinements in which the Japanese live are enveloping and complete, 
    affording only the dimmest view of a life without them. Something as simple 
    as asking directions in Japan can often reveal the peculiar isolation the 
    habit of concealment produces at the core of Japanese life. It is perfectly 
    ordinary to find a person willing to oblige. But it is also common to be 
    completely ignored, as if you had not spoken, as if you were not standing 
    there -- as if you were a ghost. This is not so much impolite behavior as it 
    is a recognition that there is (in the Jesuit's terms) no heart between you: 
    With neither formal relations nor friendship there is only strangeness, a 
    kind of nonbeing. Even if the passerby pauses to help, you may discover he 
    knows nothing of a street or building only a hundred yards away, for it is 
    not part of the tiny universe in which he lives. 
    <P>Foreigners who reside in Japan are part of the system by virtue of their 
    exclusion. Rarely does the "outside person" enter the intricate, burdensome 
    web of duties and obligations that covers all interaction among the Japanese 
    and binds each to the group. According to custom a resident gaijin, like a 
    Japanese, will be known as Fuji Film's Wilson or Smith of the International 
    Herald Tribune. One is considered to be part of a group, as every Japanese 
    is. But the foreigner soon recognizes that just as Japan is a nation of 
    insiders, it is equally one of "others." 
    <P>There never seem to be enough groups to create new "others," new 
    outsiders. It is as if people will resort to any ruse to obscure the matter 
    of public individuality. Pseudoscience is popular in this regard. A European 
    executive once sat with his Japanese manager to meet job applicants. After 
    the routine questions, the manager ended each interview with, "And what is 
    your blood type?" All but one candidate replied matter-of-factly and without 
    surprise. (The exception laughed and did not know.) Later the gaijin asked 
    about the strange inquiry. It is best, the manager explained, not to mix 
    blood types in the same work space. The idea has many adherents; newspapers 
    sometimes assess new governments according to whether cabinet members are A, 
    B, O, or some other blood type. 
    <P>When I arrived in Tokyo and began to staff my newspaper's bureau, I found 
    many young Japanese intrigued by the prospect of joining a gaijin company -- 
    an act that carried a whiff of individual risk and nonconformity, even of 
    defiance. The Japanese have made a womb of their society. But if the 
    temptation to exit it was strong, most found their fears still stronger. The 
    womb of life is confining, but it is also secure, and so most Japanese 
    remain, as it were, unborn. By the time I met Kay Itoi, who worked with me 
    at the Herald Tribune for the duration of my tour in Japan, I understood 
    that I was looking for someone with a certain courage and restlessness, even 
    impatience. 
    <P>It is in restlessness and impatience and the temptation of risk that we 
    find clues to the individual's struggle with the enveloping web. This is 
    nothing new; it is a long thread in the history of the Japanese, and to 
    describe the Japanese today is to note only the new prominence this thread 
    has taken in the weave. It is a kind of eternal tension -- between freedom 
    and belonging, community and autonomy -- and it is part of what I call 
    hidden history because it, too, is concealed -- submerged but never 
    nonexistent. after the pacific war an interesting debate took place among 
    the Japanese. It concerned something called shutai-sei. The term literally 
    means "subjecthood," but it is translated variously as "subjectivity," 
    "selfhood," "authenticity," or "autonomy." It refers to the perceiving, 
    judging, deciding individual. To achieve shutai-sei was to leave behind all 
    the old conventions: the enveloping mutual duties, the acceptance of 
    inclusion and exclusion, the suppression of individuality for the sake of 
    the displayed consensus. Shutai-sei meant to establish an autonomous 
    identity. The term also had strong connotations. It implied an energetic, 
    assertive individuality -- what I have called public individuality. The 
    autonomous person was capable not only of making moral commitments but of 
    acting openly upon them. 
    <P>It is remarkable to realize how little the Japanese of the late 1940s 
    knew of such matters. Japan had recently deployed millions of soldiers, 
    ships, planes, and weapons across vast parts of the Pacific. But, midway in 
    our century, the Japanese had no socially accepted notion of something as 
    ordinary elsewhere, as taken-for-granted, as individuality. Except in their 
    private hearts, as the old Jesuit would have put it, or in open opposition 
    to accepted norms, they could cultivate no sense of self. Their thoughts and 
    values were the thoughts and values imposed by the community. We ordinarily 
    assume that group identity is something the Japanese cling to so as to keep 
    foreigners out. But we must consider the opposite proposition: Was the group 
    not also made to keep the Japanese people in -- and to keep them from 
    becoming individuals? 
    <P>Those who debated the meaning of shutai-sei believed that cultivating the 
    autonomous self was postwar Japan's fundamental task, more essential than 
    any other. It was the failure of the Japanese to make subjective judgments, 
    they said, that led them to acquiesce when the wartime dictatorship draped a 
    blanket of ideology over them and pushed the nation into tragedy. The core 
    of the postwar project, therefore, was psychological. As the best-known 
    exponent of autonomy put it, "An internal reform of the psychological 
    structure of Japanese society must occur." 
    <P>These words belong to a man named Masao Maruyama. Maruyama, who passed 
    away in 1996 at the age of eighty-two, was without question the most 
    influential thinker Japan has produced in our century. In the great debate 
    over shutai-sei he led a camp called the "modernists," who posited two kinds 
    of autonomy. One was individual: the self as a private, independent being. 
    The other was social: the free individual who also understood his place 
    within the larger whole. These two ideas of autonomy were advanced in 
    opposition to the old notion of community, in which people had no identity 
    and no free choices. The object of all this theorizing was nothing more nor 
    less than democracy. The modernists called for the creation among the 
    Japanese of "a new, democratic human type." Their views are easily boiled 
    down: Democracy does not work without individual liberty, and individual 
    liberty is impossible to sustain without a democratic context. 
    <P>The debate over shutai-sei collapsed in the late 1940s. The new 
    democratic human type never appeared, a casualty of the reverse course. 
    Under the restored prewar elite the Japanese were unable to escape from the 
    old, confining notions of community. That is why Japan took on the machinery 
    of democracy after the war but has had no authentic democracy. In the Cold 
    War climate many of those who urged the notion of autonomy upon the 
    Japanese, including Maruyama, were dismissed as dangerous leftists. And here 
    we arrive at one of the fundamental ironies in the way we look upon the 
    modern Japanese. There was indeed an active left in Japan after the war -- a 
    left of many hues. But so what? Examining the postwar situation today, the 
    notion of a Soviet-style Japan looks a bit ridiculous. Much of what we took 
    to be the subversive left stood not for collectivism but an escape from 
    collectivism, not the suppression of private endeavor but the embrace of it. 
    They had argued for the very thing Westerners profess to believe in most 
    profoundly: the primacy of the individual. 
    <P>The shutai-sei episode has many echoes in the past. So we must ask, Why 
    has the group had such a tenacious hold on the Japanese? Where in history 
    did so deep-seated a notion of community come from? 
    <P>The group in Japan is as ancient as its people. Rice cultivation required 
    communities based on mutual dependence. Geography isolated the Japanese: one 
    community from another by the islands' mountainous landscapes, and the 
    islands from the Asian mainland by the rough waters of the Japan Sea. There 
    is nothing peculiar about the community ethos that resulted. Ancient Japan 
    was a primitive society that had much in common with any other. Japan took 
    its first unusual turn in the seventh century, under a scholarly prince 
    regent named Shotoku. It was then the Japanese began to build the group 
    society that would endure until our time. 
    <P>Under Shotoku Japan began to borrow wholesale from China much of what we 
    now think of as Japanese. Along with Buddhism, urban design, a central 
    bureaucracy, and much else, Shotoku imported the Confucian classics. Through 
    these Japan learned the revered virtues -- benevolence, filial piety, 
    sincerity, and so on -- and the five relationships that define the human 
    stations: ruler and ruled, father and son, elder brother and younger, 
    husband and wife, friend and friend. We might consider Shotoku Japan's first 
    great Orientalist -- the first to imagine a "Japan" other than what it was. 
    He brought order and hierarchy to people who had been notably informal in 
    such matters. The Japanese court was typical: It, too, had been rather 
    informal. Then it assumed elaborate ranks, all of them quintessentially 
    Confucian -- Greater Benevolence and Lesser Benevolence, Greater and Lesser 
    Propriety, and on through the Chinese sage's catalogue of righteousness. 
    <P>The feudal period began at the end of the twelfth century, when 
    provincial warriors, the earliest samurai, forced the emperor into obscurity 
    and built a military dictatorship that lasted seven centuries under a 
    succession of generals -- the shoguns. We are familiar with many of the 
    samurai's features: his discipline and austerity, his rigorously simple 
    aesthetic, his adherence to an honor code similar in outline to the chivalry 
    of medieval Europe. The code of the samurai was elaborately Confucian, with 
    a complex system of mutual duties: a system of give-and-take interdependence 
    meant to keep samurai -- professional killers, martial arts cultists -- from 
    destroying one another. Over time the shogun told the samurai what to wear, 
    how to settle a dispute, how to prepare meals, what kind of pottery to have 
    around the house, how much to spend on a gift. Rules were everything. Rank 
    and "house," signified in the precise colors, fabrics, and patterns of one's 
    clothing, were also everything. 
    <P>For the nameless majority the samurai were the stuff of heroic legend, 
    the doers of high deeds. But they were not really individuals. When they 
    internalized the code they built an edifice within. Each act, no matter how 
    perilous or against the odds, was at once a mark of distinction and an 
    affirmation of conformity to the code. It was a display of will -- which was 
    also cultivated according to the code. There is, for instance, the matter of 
    loyalty. The great sage was clear about the virtues. Loyalty was not first 
    among them -- benevolence was. And loyalty meant allegiance according to 
    one's conscience. But the samurai made loyalty paramount and made no 
    allowance for the inner voice. In the Japanese conception, loyalty and 
    filial piety together required obedience, even at the sacrifice of reason or 
    conscience. It is no wonder that the Buddhism of the samurai was Zen, a 
    native-hatched sect. Zen taught emptiness of mind: the suppression of self 
    by an exertion of will so complete as to enable action without conscious 
    thought. 
    <P>The samurai can be viewed as the first Japanese whose individuality was 
    essentially private. How else to describe people who found purity in the 
    utmost detachment from everything they did that was visible to others? 
    Satori, Zen enlightenment, was a matter of private salvation. Seppuku, 
    ritual suicide, was an honorable way out of disgrace because it was an act 
    of private individuality. In this we can wonder about the excessive care 
    with which seppuku was carried out: the crosswise cut through the belly, 
    then upward toward the navel -- incisions that made death certain but 
    damaged no vital organs. Was it a ritual revelation of the intact self 
    within, or a final, public assertion that there was no self, that the self 
    was obliterated so that honor could be posthumously restored? 
    <P>It is not difficult to see in the samurai things we try to understand 
    today: the concealment of personality, rigorous loyalty to the group -- 
    loyalty to a fault. But how were these habits of mind prolonged so far into 
    our own time? 
    <P>In 1542 three Portuguese sailors landed on an island off the coast of 
    Kyushu. The lost mariners were the first Europeans to reach Japan. Francis 
    Xavier, the Jesuit from Goa, arrived seven years later to plant the cross. 
    Notably, there was little interest in how these first Westerners lived and 
    thought, but much in the things they brought: clocks, musical instruments, 
    medicines, maps. Muskets prompted Japan's first try at industrial copying: 
    They were reproduced in great numbers. 
    <P>As Christianity spread, successive shoguns feared it would unite the 
    daimyo, or feudal lords, each with an army of his own, against them. The 
    first ban on missionaries came in 1587. By 1639, a century after foreigners 
    first stepped ashore, isolation edicts called sakoku, "closed country," were 
    in effect: Gaijin were barred with the exception of a few Dutch merchants; 
    "Dutch learning," open to a select few, became the sole source of outside 
    knowledge. Anyone attempting to leave Japan would be put to death; no ship 
    could be built to carry more than a thousand koku -- which was a ban on 
    oceangoing vessels.* Sakoku was the work of a family of shoguns named 
    Tokugawa. The first of them, Ieyasu, took power in 1603 and moved the 
    military government from Kyoto, the decadent imperial capital, to a swampy 
    hamlet then called Edo and now Tokyo (Eastern Capital). 
    <P>The Tokugawa ruled for two and a half centuries, until 1868. Theirs was 
    the most extreme form of feudalism Japan had ever known. The Japanese lived 
    like figurines in a bell jar -- locked in hereditary status and the ancient, 
    cyclical time of masters and cultivators. Progress was prohibited -- the 
    enemy of changelessness. The Tokugawa were the greatest Orientalists Japan 
    has yet produced. Their notion of Japan was grotesque, utterly static. It 
    became more imaginary as the Edo centuries wore on, so requiring ever 
    greater bureaucratic will to enforce it. 
    <P>Edo Japan was a society of distinctions -- beneath which lay a profound 
    conformity. Everyone was ranked according to caste: samurai, peasants, 
    artisans, merchants. Each caste had its assigned role. Each was segregated 
    by dress, means of transport, and countless other details. Only the samurai 
    could bear swords -- long ones in the countryside, short ones in town. 
    Samurai were permitted no contact with peasants, the peasants none with 
    townsmen. A townsman's kimono was to be this long. Peasants must rise at 
    this hour, consume such and such a meal, avoid tea, plant bamboo this close 
    to their huts, dig latrines that far away. 
    <P>Japan as a caste society was nothing new. The last family of shoguns -- 
    there were fifteen Tokugawa rulers before the end -- merely took the feudal 
    rigidities to their limits. They were Confucian fundamentalists. The 
    Tokugawa were obsessed with edicts, decrees, prohibitions, gruesome 
    punishments -- everything needed to maintain a climate of terror. Edo kept 
    an immense network of enforcers -- secret police, frontier guards, censors, 
    undercover agents. Villages were organized into five-person groups: Each 
    member was required to spy on the other four, each group on other groups. In 
    spite of this (or because of it) there were roughly three thousand peasant 
    uprisings during the Tokugawa centuries -- one a month, on average, though 
    they gained in frequency as time went on. There were another three thousand 
    "disturbances" that never went as far as the house trashings and riots 
    scholars count as uprisings. 
    <P>Feudalism in this strangely illuminated twilight is an essential piece of 
    Japan's past -- not only because it lasted so long or because we can trace 
    back to it so much of what the Japanese are today, but because the history 
    of Edo has been the battleground in modern Japan, or a large part of it. Edo 
    Japan gives us a classic example of the power of leaving things out. And 
    what is always left out is the conflict and tension that existed just below 
    the surface -- the history that was hidden. 
    <P>Today we have a peculiar idea of the Edo era -- a half-true distortion of 
    this bizarre age. Our received image is of a dull but orderly time, well 
    expressed in the standard term "the Tokugawa peace." In Japan: Past and 
    Present, Edwin Reischauer gave a neat summary of the orthodoxy, as 
    uncomplicated as one of the period's woodblock prints: "The prolonged, 
    complete peace of the Tokugawa period brought to Japan years of 
    unprecedented prosperity, and industrial production and trade grew rapidly." 
    Based upon such imagery, we are invited to think of the Edo era as "early 
    modern Japan" -- never the derogatory "late feudalism." This is an 
    exceptional irony, for from the Edo era onward it has been a mark of Japan's 
    leaders that they have, in one way or another, sought to defer the true 
    arrival of modern society in Japan. 
    <P>Edo's advances cannot be denied. Rudimentary manufacturing began; 
    restless merchants laid the groundwork for modern trade, and a lively 
    popular culture -- Kabuki, pulpy literature -- took root in the pleasure 
    quarters of Edo, Osaka, and Kyoto. But there was no peace in Edo Japan. 
    There was a sort of federalist settlement between the shoguns and the 
    daimyo, but otherwise the era was marked by merciless exploitation, 
    purposeful deprivation, paranoic police controls, coercion, more or less 
    constant official violence -- and more or less constant popular resistance 
    to all of these things. In its terror and totality, its nightmarish 
    bureaucracy and manipulation of knowledge, Edo Japan is usefully compared 
    with the later Soviet Union. In its violent dream of Oriental agrarianism it 
    suggests the Cambodia of the Khmer Rouge. 
    <P>The lasting gift of the Tokugawa was to deliver the Japanese to the 
    doorstep of the industrial age with the feudal edifice crumbling all around 
    but still intact within each of them. Today there are the corporate samurai 
    -- as obsessed with "house" and hierarchy as the old warriors. The Japanese 
    still puzzle over the precise value of gifts to be given for precisely which 
    favors received, precisely the proper clothing for each occasion, the 
    precise seating in a room according to rank, inclusion, and exclusion. 
    <P>Many Japanese entertain a kind of ersatz nostalgia for the Edo era -- 
    ersatz because it is cartoonish, sanitized. Among the old sayings one still 
    hears in the countryside, for instance, is "Three houses in front, one on 
    either side." It is a simple admonition not to act before surveying all 
    those around you. And it is a neat description of how the complex system of 
    duties and obligations works. Those who still dwell in the old villages 
    often advance this phrase as a measure of community spirit and the endurance 
    of village values. Perhaps it is that, partly. But the saying requires its 
    full context. Properly understood, it also suggests something of the 
    individual's wariness toward all others, a wariness the Japanese learned 
    long ago to carry within. 
    <P>There is a remarkable description of the Edo era -- remarkable because it 
    remains so oddly apt today. It was written by Yukichi Fukuzawa, an educator 
    in the era that followed, and it appeared in one of his best-known works, 
    Outline of Civilization. Fukuzawa appears today on the face of the 
    ten-thousand-yen note, stern but wistful, wearing a somber kimono but with a 
    Western haircut. One senses he looks forward in that pose. But in Outline, 
    published in 1873, he looked back to a people atomized but unrealized, 
    intensely private but intensely unfree. The passage is a concise description 
    of a society in which individuality lives only in the secrets of each of its 
    members: 
    <P>They all depended on the government and did not concern themselves with 
    national affairs. Among a million people there were a million different 
    minds. Each person shut himself up in his own house and ignored the outside 
    world as if it were a foreign country. They failed to consult one another 
    even about the best way to clean their wells, let alone ways to repair 
    roads. If they chanced to come upon a dog's excrement, they went around it. 
    They were so preoccupied with trying to avoid getting involved in anything 
    that they had no time to discuss things together. This long-ingrained habit 
    became a custom and produced the present sad state of affairs. 
    <P>Respect for and dependence upon authority, unswerving loyalty, austerity, 
    and a rigorous work ethic -- all are marks late feudalism has left upon the 
    Japanese. We are invited to conclude that Japan is by tradition and culture 
    a vertical society and that Japanese ethics are situational -- based not on 
    principle but on the ever-shifting net of relationships in which the 
    Japanese live. The best-known explanation of these matters is The 
    Chrysanthemum and the Sword, a book published in 1946 by the anthropologist 
    Ruth Benedict. Benedict distinguished Japan as a shame culture as opposed to 
    a guilt culture: "True shame cultures rely on external sanctions for good 
    behavior, not, as true guilt cultures do, on an internalized conviction of 
    sin." 
    <P>These observations cannot be dismissed. But they obscure as much as they 
    explain. The Japanese are shamed when they transgress, for they have 
    disgraced their household. But are there really people in the world who 
    never feel the pangs of guilt, who have no conscience? Loyalty can be a fine 
    thing, but Japan's notion of loyalty, loyalty that admits of no questions, 
    led it into a world war, after all. Hard work, by the same token, has 
    historically been a matter of desperate necessity. As to respect for 
    authority, it is better understood as obsequiousness bred of fear. 
    <P>A clear picture of the past leads to a fundamental point about the 
    Japanese, an understanding that changes everything. Once we recognize the 
    conflict beneath the surface, we understand that group identity had more to 
    do with coercion and power than with tradition and culture. Then we must 
    rethink our conclusions about the attributes of the Japanese we are 
    encouraged to admire. Are they so enviable as to be emulated? More 
    admirable, by any measure, is the long, buried struggle against feudal 
    terror and tyranny -- the same struggle we admire in our own history. There 
    is nothing especially "Japanese" about what we call the Japanese character 
    or personality, we must conclude. We can talk only about people subject to 
    certain conditions and their response to those conditions. 
    <P>It was the primitive habit of confinement and exclusion, fixed during the 
    Edo centuries, that the Japanese tried to overcome within themselves when 
    they considered such questions as autonomy in the late 1940s. That is why 
    they found themselves, then as now, only half at home in the modern world. 
    Alone among primitive societies, Japan is "advanced"; alone among advanced 
    societies, Japan has remained primitive. we know japan today as a late 
    developer. When, in the 1860s and 1870s, it sent emissaries abroad for the 
    first time in two and a half centuries, the objects of Western industry -- 
    threshers, railroads, air compressors, iron bridges -- left them shocked. 
    So, it must be added, did everything they attributed to Western 
    individualism: political debate, labor strife, each person running off in 
    his own direction. The West, especially America, seemed to live in a state 
    of barely controlled anarchy. Capitalism struck the Japanese as "warfare in 
    peacetime," as an early diplomatic diarist put it. These first travelers 
    across the Pacific were like experiments with time, people who were born 
    into the modern world but who had seen nothing of it. 
    <P>We also know Japan as an addicted borrower, first from China and, 
    beginning in the late nineteenth century, from us. In this the Japanese were 
    discriminating, choosing from each country only what they wanted. From 
    France they learned of oil painting, from England of warships, from America 
    of manufacturing. But they missed something essential about all that they 
    borrowed. They did not understand that a piece of machinery -- to say 
    nothing of a school system or a set of laws -- had a long past, that it was 
    an expression of the society that produced it. Like the feudal Japanese who 
    encountered the first Europeans, Japan's first modernizers were concerned 
    only with mono -- things, hardware. 
    <P>But as much as Japan was a late developer, it was also an early one -- 
    indeed, the earliest. If, among advanced countries, Japan was near to last, 
    among Third World countries it was first. The Japanese were the first 
    non-Western people to absorb the things of the Western world. And Japan's 
    modern leaders did no more than what many Third World leaders have done 
    since: They adopted the technological ways of the West while preserving the 
    social, spiritual, and psychological identity of the past. A century ago the 
    Japanese called this wakon yosai, Japanese spirit, Western things. Today 
    they would profess to believe in "Asian values" -- as distinct from 
    universal values. 
    <P>Japan quickly followed the West's belief in humanity's alienation from 
    nature and so set about subjugating the natural world. That was a 
    prerequisite of industrialization. But it rejected the West's notion of the 
    sovereign individual. Instead Japan tried to remain a communal society -- 
    hence the idea of a "family state" -- in which the individual was dependent 
    upon the authority of the group. To put it another way, Japan rejected the 
    idea that people were the makers of their own history, autonomous agents of 
    reason and judgment. Such a proposition was blocked at the border like a 
    contaminated vegetable or an uncensored foreign newspaper. In short, Japan 
    did not become modern so much as a consumer of the modern. 
    <P>Is this to say that, as the West had an Enlightenment, so must the 
    Japanese and the rest of humanity? That is the error of the Chrysanthemum 
    Club and its "modernization theory": To be modern is to be Western, and 
    everyone must sooner or later follow our path. But neither do we want to 
    make the opposite mistake -- to assert that the liberation of the individual 
    was something peculiar to Western societies at a certain moment in history. 
    The Japanese never had an Enlightenment, but that is hardly the point. No 
    one familiar with the coercion and resistance of the feudal centuries -- and 
    of the modern era, for that matter -- can conclude that the Japanese failed 
    to evolve toward greater autonomy and individuality because they did not 
    want to or were not ready to. 
    <P>In July of 1853 Matthew Perry anchored four steamships off the coast 
    south of Edo. The shogun and his immense, creaking bureaucracy had advance 
    word and expected him. But local fishermen on the water that day tell us 
    more about Japan's true sentiment. They thought Perry's "black ships" were 
    some sort of floating volcano, and they scattered like birds at the sight of 
    a sudden intruder. 
    <P>Japan was about to get its first dose of gaiatsu, foreign pressure. Four 
    years after Perry arrived, the shogunate -- confused, decayed, desperate -- 
    signed treaties with the United States, Britain, Holland, Russia, and France 
    that extended their jurisdiction onto Japanese soil and limited Edo's right 
    to tax imports. In 1867 the last shogun abdicated, and Japan began its age 
    of modernization. It never forgot the humiliation of the unequal treaties. 
    They shaped Japan's goal to make itself the West's industrial and military 
    equal and lent the endeavor an urgency that left no Japanese untouched. 
    <P>It is easy to misunderstand the West's part in all this. Perry's ships 
    were merely catalysts, arguably not even constructive catalysts. At the 
    moment of their arrival all the principal agents of the great change to come 
    were within. Japan may have been better off without Perry, for it might have 
    felt less urgency in the task ahead, and it might have done things less 
    expediently, so avoiding the tragic consequences that lay in the future. 
    <P>The Meiji era, named for its emperor's reign, began with the restoration 
    of imperial sovereignty. For seven centuries Japan had been ruled by 
    shoguns, and before that by regents. They wielded power in the emperor's 
    name, but by 1867 the throne was far from public view, its transcendent 
    authority a myth. With the restoration the emperor suddenly exited the 
    neurasthenic shadows and stepped back onto center stage. So at the core of 
    all the advances there lay a return. The emperor was to become a modern 
    monarch, but he was also a god-king of the sort not seen since ancient days. 

    <P>The events leading up to the restoration were extremely bizarre. In 1866 
    the political scene was a tangle of forces backing either the shogun or the 
    throne. The fires of antiforeign chauvinism, long fanned by the bureaucracy, 
    were raging. Crop failures and the new foreign trade -- imports of 
    manufactured goods, exports of gold and silver -- had wrecked the economy. 
    Popular unrest was at a peak: more than a hundred rural uprisings, and urban 
    riots at the rate of several a month. A thread of premonitory superstition 
    ran through all of this. A comet that year was taken as a portent of some 
    imminent but incalculable change. 
    <P>Early in 1867 everything went strangely quiet. Popular unrest more or 
    less ceased. But in the autumn Japan broke out in ecstatic revelry -- a 
    combination of rioting, religious hysteria, sake-powered partying, and 
    spontaneous, orgiastic street dancing. Houses were hung with brightly 
    colored rice cakes, straw, and flowers. Dancers -- men and women, young and 
    old -- clogged the streets to clamoring bells, drums, gongs, chimes, and 
    whistles. Drunken commoners tramped through the houses of the privileged 
    without -- unforgivably -- removing their shoes. Popular lyrics celebrated 
    food, sake, and sex. People gave clothing away to strangers and threw money 
    in the streets. The frenzy swept from Edo to Hiroshima after thousands of 
    amulets, paper charms with Shinto and Buddhist gods painted on them, began 
    falling from the sky. 
    <P>No historian has explained the rain of amulets. But they were not the 
    only peculiar feature of this altogether odd interlude. Cross-dressing was 
    widespread. Despite all the pent-up anger of late Edo, there was no 
    violence. A British diplomat traveling in Osaka remarked on the absence of 
    fear or animosity. Everywhere the revelers repeated the same incantatory 
    chant: Ee ja nai ka! This elusive term has numerous inexact translations. 
    Its nearest literal meaning is "Isn't it good?" or "Why not? It's all 
    right!" A scholar recently described it as falling somewhere among "Right 
    on! Go for it," "What the hell," and "No more bullshit!" 
    <P>Odd as it seems, given our image of the Japanese, ee ja nai ka was the 
    sound of modern Japan's beginning. The delirious chanting lasted until the 
    spring of 1868. And amid the cacophony of a sexually charged carnival, two 
    samurai clans loyal to the emperor, the Satsuma and the Choshu, found a 
    singular opportunity. During the interim from the autumn of 1867 to the 
    spring of the new year they secured the shogun's resignation and wheeled the 
    new emperor forward as the new ruler of a new Japan. 
    <P>Ee ja nai ka! The subtext of every shout was an open declaration of 
    liberation, a jack-in-the-box release of pent-up desire. This alone would 
    give ee ja nai ka a place in Japan's hidden history, but there is more. What 
    does it mean when people of no great sophistication take to cross-dressing, 
    or to trampling across tatami in muddy shoes, or, in abject poverty, to 
    throwing money away? We cannot be satisfied with the notion that a commoner 
    celebrating sex and gluttony in late Edo Japan saw no farther than the next 
    sake barrel and a free-spirited companion. Ee ja nai ka was a shout toward 
    the heavens, a rejection of the reigning order. It was as if people had seen 
    through the roof of the great house of Tokugawa to glimpse an immensity of 
    alternatives in the open sky beyond. Above all, it was an act of public 
    individuality. 
    <P>Edo's last months were both expectant and subversive. By the end, ee ja 
    nai ka took on an explicitly political meaning -- it was another inchoate 
    expression of rebellion, like the constant protests of the Edo era. The 
    evident sexuality offers us a clue to understanding this moment as one of 
    undirected individual assertion, desire without an available language. But 
    the formlessness of this rebellion does not obscure its psychological 
    complexity. Speculating, we can wonder whether the shouts of ee ja nai ka 
    were the deformed flowers of a Japanese enlightenment ready to sprout but 
    without the ground to grow. More certainly, they reveal that the 
    individual's struggle against the enfolding web was part of modern Japan 
    from the moment it came into existence. 
    <P>The emperor restored in 1868 was a brisk, intelligent sixteen-year-old 
    named Mutsuhito. Even before he moved in a dazzling procession from Kyoto to 
    the renamed Tokyo, he issued a kind of constitutional preamble called the 
    Charter Oath, an open pledge to his ancestors. Third of its five clauses was 
    this one: 
    <P>The common people, no less than the civil and military officials, shall 
    all attain their aspirations, so that the people's minds shall not be made 
    weary. 
    <P>No number of bearded commodores or imposed treaties can account for such 
    an astonishing proposition. To attain one's goals -- even to aspire -- was a 
    bracing, revolutionary idea. But the Charter Oath is easily explained. It 
    was issued amid the confusion and anticipation of the ee ja nai ka 
    interlude. The oath was intended to calm the nervous, the doubtful, and the 
    impetuous. And to do so the emperor and those around him chose to 
    acknowledge the popular desire for change of the most fundamental kind. In 
    one sentence the young Mutsuhito announced the end of a long, traumatic 
    bondage. All boundaries between the official and ordinary, the high and low, 
    were to be erased. A society of fixed status was to be transformed into one 
    of mobility and striving individuals. When Mutsuhito left Kyoto for Tokyo, 
    for three hundred miles commoners pressed their faces to the earth along the 
    roadside. Mutsuhito may have been a god-king, but let us understand this 
    spectacle properly: He was also the man who banished the terrorizing 
    shogunate from the life of every Japanese. 
    <P>But the society the emperor promised never arrived. Meiji freed the 
    Japanese from the feudal castes. They could entertain their individual 
    aspirations. But the modern era did not give them the individual liberty to 
    pursue their aspirations. Meiji turned out to be nothing more than a 
    transition from feudal absolutism to absolutism in nineteenth-century form. 
    Japan remained a communal society -- closed instead of open, particular 
    instead of universal, a society of individuals who could cultivate no 
    individual values. The contradiction made modern Japan what it is today -- a 
    place of immense but unrealizable dreams, relentless competition, and 
    near-universal frustration. No matter how contemporary we imagine the 
    Japanese to be, the society promised in the Charter Oath is the one they 
    still struggle to attain, whose betrayal they seek to redress. 
    <P>A period of liberal exploration did ensue after the emperor moved into 
    the shogun's palace. For half a dozen years Japan lived in a state of happy 
    inconsistency. A hundred flowers bloomed. Restlessness replaced the long 
    sleep of Edo, just as it would replace the defeated dictatorship in 1945. 
    There was no fixed way forward. Intellectuals read Rousseau's Social 
    Contract and Mill's On Liberty, among many other Western works, as quickly 
    as they could be translated. Then the Satsuma and Choshu leadership, known 
    as the Sat-Cho, retreated into conservatism (just as it would in the late 
    1940s), so making itself an entrenched, undemocratic oligarchy -- the worthy 
    successor of the shogunate. 
    <P>But what was the early idealism made of? And why did it fail? The best 
    answer comes from the educator Yukichi Fukuzawa, he of the ten-thousand-yen 
    note. Fukuzawa was among the foremost exponents of liberalism and later a 
    strident critic of the Meiji oligarchs. In 1876 he collected several years' 
    worth of pamphlets under the title An Encouragement of Learning. Rendered in 
    plain Japanese, the book sold more than 3 million copies. In it Fukuzawa 
    invented the very notion of individualism for the Japanese. His term was 
    dokuritsu, spirit of independence. The new word, like the book, was beloved 
    for its simplicity, but we should listen carefully to what Fukuzawa meant, 
    for it is a key to the ethos of the era:
    <P>
    <UL>When the people of a nation do not have the spirit of individual 
      independence, the corresponding right of national independence cannot be 
      realized. Persons without the spirit of personal independence will not 
      have deep concern for their country. Japan must be filled with the spirit 
      of independence if we are to defend her against foreign threats.</UL>
    <P>In these passages Fukuzawa defines the intellectual failing of Japan's 
    first foray into liberalism: He took the cultivation of the autonomous 
    individual to be a means, an expedient to a greater goal, instead of an end 
    in itself, the greatest goal of all. 
    <P>Fukuzawa is ranked today among modern Japan's great philosophes. Liberals 
    still claim him for his opposition to the reaction that followed the early 
    period of possibility. The Bank of Japan puts his picture on its bills 
    because his image lends a liberal veneer to early modern history. In his 
    time Fukuzawa had many conservative enemies, men more interested in the 
    Confucian virtues than in the "spirit of independence." But what was this 
    great intellectual clash really about? Only method. Fukuzawa's adversaries 
    wanted a strong state able to resist foreigners and renegotiate the unequal 
    treaties. To them, the road ahead lay not in any notion of individuality but 
    in continued reverence for the hierarchical order. Fukuzawa shared their 
    goal -- he never lost sight of it. He differed only over the usefulness of 
    the past. 
    <P>Meiji Japan became a cauldron of discontent with the defeat even of 
    Fukuzawa's flawed liberalism. Indeed, the new Japan was not much quieter 
    than the Japan of the old shogunate. Crowds gathered as suddenly as summer 
    storms. Popular protests, riots, and resistance movements were features of 
    daily life. Decommissioned samurai, along with intellectuals, small-time 
    factory owners, village landlords, and ambitious rustics of all varieties, 
    formed a loose, nationwide group to demand popular rights -- an idea so 
    foreign it required an invented word, kenri. These were Japan's first 
    politicians. They also introduced the notion of minshu-shugi, which meant 
    "people-masterism" -- that is, democracy. 
    <P>By 1881 civil unrest forced the Sat-Cho to promise the Japanese a 
    constitution and a national assembly. These arrived on schedule in 1889 and 
    1890, respectively. By then there were political parties and a cabinet -- as 
    well as a self-appointed peerage modeled (like the constitution) on imperial 
    Germany's. The first elections were held. But having promised the 
    institutions of modern government, the oligarchy then made sure they had no 
    modern meaning. The constitution vested ultimate authority in the emperor -- 
    in whose name the oligarchy presided. The imperial Diet, as the legislature 
    was called, was elected by slightly more than one percent of the population 
    -- and had only an advisory role anyway. The cabinet declared itself to be 
    "transcendental" -- that is, beyond politics and party interests. So was 
    modern government imported and rejigged as if it were another new machine. 
    <P>By century's end Japan was what it would remain until 1945 -- an 
    ideological state, a nation whose people could understand themselves only as 
    members of the larger community. At the core of Japanese ideology, of 
    course, was worship of the emperor. The emperor was the head of the kazoku 
    kokka, the "family state." The family state was unique in the world because 
    it possessed an ineffable quality called kokutai, "national essence." Being 
    a family state, having an emperor descended from the gods, and having such a 
    singular thing as national essence made the Japanese a chosen people. These 
    ideas were transmitted in a thousand different ways. Instead of encouraging 
    critical thought, the individual as a shaper of society, the ideologues 
    encouraged conditioned reflexes -- the individual as society's object. 
    Ideology is what the Japanese got instead of autonomy and democracy. 
    <P>Japan's ideological stew was a rich concoction. The Tokyo elite was 
    hardly alone in inventing tradition. Bismarck's new Germany was doing the 
    same thing. Both nations needed legitimacy, some device to make people feel 
    "German" or "Japanese." Being ex-samurai themselves, Japan's leaders turned 
    to their own past to create the new Japanese. Japan would be a nation of 
    noble warriors, all serving the emperor with the old, peculiar notion of 
    loyalty and all the old inflexibility. This feature of the modern era is 
    often missed, but it is essential. While Japan was busy westernizing, it was 
    also busily "samuraizing." The first prime minister, Hirobumi Ito, a former 
    samurai who took up the sword at thirteen, when Perry's ships arrived, 
    explained this point to his colleagues in the 1880s: 
    <P>The major task facing us today is inculcating within the entire populace 
    the spirit of loyalty, devotion, and heroism that was formerly associated 
    with the samurai class, and making these values their values. Thus we must 
    teach the common people to work and study hard for the sake of their 
    neighborhoods and villages, and never to waver in matters that would lead to 
    the destruction of their families. Moreover, they must develop a peaceful 
    and obedient character, show respect for the law, and demonstrate an 
    understanding of our noble moral ideals and highly refined national 
    sentiments. 
    <P>A nation of samurai would be a very different thing from Japan as it had 
    been, a place of conflict between great and little, the elevated and the 
    common. There would be no democracy, but there would be no tension, either. 
    Everyone, however humble his circumstances, would think of himself as part 
    of the great tradition. The old samurai code would become "the beautiful 
    customs." In 1907, five years before the Meiji era ended, a bureaucrat with 
    the benign paternalism of a true imperial subject explained how the 
    beautiful customs were supposed to work. At the time, the nation's new 
    industries were a riot of unrest and violence: 
    <P>The old, beautiful customs existing in Japan are concepts of mutual love 
    and respect from employer to employee. This master-servant relationship is 
    not an evil feudal remnant but a benefit gained from feudalism. Will not 
    these beautiful customs, namely compassion from above for those below, and 
    respect from below for those above, be greatly helpful in harmonizing 
    labor-capital relations? 
    <P>Looking back many decades later, the scholar Masao Maruyama likened 
    ideology to "a many-layered though invisible net over the Japanese people." 
    Another postwar thinker described it as "an enormous black box, into which 
    the Japanese unknowingly walked." Why did this happen? Why were the Japanese 
    so easily led into xenophobia, extreme patriotism -- and war? If we 
    understand this about the Japanese we will have understood a great deal 
    about who they were then, who they are now, and who they will become. 
    <P>The ideological period is a tragic aspect of Japan's past, but it is not 
    incomprehensible. When Japan began to embrace the modern, ordinary Japanese 
    had no notion of what it meant to be part of a modern nation. They knew of 
    nations only what the new oligarchy told them with shrill persistence. And 
    among the most important ways they learned -- an essential institution in 
    creating nationality -- was military conscription. Neither did they know 
    what it meant to be an individual: The most liberal among them tied the idea 
    to the nation-state. Fukuzawa's mistake, the mistake that said, "To be a 
    person means to be a Japanese person," was repeated many times. And it would 
    be hard to exaggerate the attraction of being "Japanese," and of 
    participating as a recognized part of a modern nation, to people who had 
    been so recently only nameless serfs. 
    <P>This could not, of course, resolve the problem of public individuality so 
    evident at the restoration. What became of all those shouting individuals? 
    Enveloping though the emperor system was, we deny the Japanese any social or 
    psychological complexity if we assume that, one and all, they became avid 
    followers of emperor ideology. Instead, a kind of con game began in the 
    space between the Meiji ideal and the reality of modern life, a con game 
    played by the concealed individual behind the public mask. Publicly one 
    strove in the new Japan for the emperor and the nation; privately one strove 
    for oneself. 
    <P>Few Japanese of the Meiji era ever resolved the contradiction their 
    incomplete modernization presented them. What it meant to be Japanese, to 
    say nothing of individualism, was hopelessly fogged. The ideological 
    fanatics were many, selfishness their constant complaint -- no surprise, for 
    the con game was extensively played. It is no wonder that Soseki Natsume, 
    the great novelist of the early modern period (and a great writer of any age 
    and nation), was so saddened by the spectacle. The confusion that reigns 
    over the Japanese today has its roots in his time. 
    <P>Soseki led a troubled life, suffering often to the brink of emotional 
    collapse. In 1900 he traveled to England, where he struggled to learn all he 
    could about Westerners and their literature. Then he made the discovery that 
    was to rule his life: The most profound lesson the Japanese could learn was 
    not to be like anyone else, but to be themselves -- to live their own 
    authentic individuality. Soseki spent his life as a writer trying to convey 
    this simple truth. But it never stopped weighing upon him -- it was his 
    blessing and his curse -- because so few understood it. 
    <P>In 1914, two years after Meiji ended, two years into the era called 
    Taisho, Soseki gave a lecture titled "My Individualism" to a group of 
    Japanese students. He was almost certainly circumspect in his remarks, for 
    individualism ranked high at that point as a danger to the ideological 
    state. But his message -- that one must reject the false coin of Meiji in 
    all its guises -- is clear enough today. "You make peace with yourself when 
    the individuality with which you were born arrives where it belongs," he 
    told his young audience at one point. And at another: 
    <P>I urge you to accomplish this, not for the nation's sake, nor even for 
    the sake of your families, but because it is absolutely necessary for your 
    own personal happiness.
    <P>And another:
    <P>
    <P>Individual liberty is indispensable for the development of [the] 
    individuality that I spoke of earlier. And finally:
    <P>As I see it, individualism advocates respecting the existence of others 
    at the same time that one respects one's own existence. . . . More simply 
    stated, individualism is a philosophy that replaces cliquism with values 
    based on personal judgment of right and wrong. An individualist is not 
    forever running with the group, forming cliques that thrash around blindly 
    in the interests of power and money. That is why there lurks beneath the 
    surface of his philosophy a loneliness unknown to others. As soon as we deny 
    our little groups, then I simply go my way and I let the other man go his, 
    unhindered. Sometimes we cannot avoid becoming scattered. That is what is 
    lonely. 
    <P>Soseki understood loneliness as the mark not only of an authentic 
    individual but of someone isolated by his insight. Few Japanese saw, as he 
    put it, "the distinction between yourself and others." They did not accept 
    that individuality lay finally in rejecting the group and discarding the 
    masks of sameness. soseki's japan, and the Japan that followed, was an 
    unsettled place. The Russian revolution and unrest at home inspired numerous 
    challenges to the status quo I have described. In 1918 a group known as the 
    Association of New Men called for "a rational reconstruction of contemporary 
    Japan." In the 1920s there was a period of party government -- a direct 
    affront to the old oligarchy. At this time the Japanese also shifted their 
    focus from institutions to psychology: It was in the twenties that they 
    first began discussing shutai-sei, autonomy. But the period of "Taisho 
    democracy," as it is called, was short-lived. There was little social or 
    political framework to support all the new ideas -- which were imported 
    ideas, after all. And as intellectuals reacted against the foreignness of 
    the things that inspired them, democrats became nationalists and socialists, 
    national socialists. 
    <P>It was no long leap to the 1930s, when the military took power in Japan 
    and turned out the lights on such questions as democracy and autonomy. All 
    that had to wait until the end of the coming war -- the "total war" against 
    the West. 
    <P>In december of 1945, an American correspondent named Mark Gayn wandered 
    one day in the Shimbashi district, south of Tokyo Station and the Ginza. 
    Then as now, Shimbashi was a hectic quarter given over to small-time 
    businesses, though all that had survived the war was a bustling black 
    market. Gayn later recorded the excursion in his book Japan Diary. 
    "Conductors are having difficulty with men who smoke in street cars, despite 
    'No Smoking' signs. The men say, 'Do we have democracy, or don't we?'" 
    <P>Nothing better captures the confusion that greeted the Americans. What 
    was this thing from abroad called (by this time) demokurashii? Did it not 
    strip away the past, fulfilling at last the restoration's unmet promise? The 
    promise of the occupation could arrive only as another misunderstood import 
    -- precisely what it was. Democracy requires institutions that balance a 
    diversity of interests. But Japan had no such institutions. The Meiji 
    oligarchy gave Japan a constitution and a parliament, but neither was 
    democratic. Japan's one try at democracy, in the 1920s, ended with a 
    military takeover. For centuries diversity was simply suppressed -- hidden 
    behind masks. 
    <P>Wasn't the postwar debate over shutai-sei, autonomy, which began at the 
    time of Gayn's trolley ride, in some way similar to the shouts of Ee ja nai 
    ka! as the shogunate collapsed? Behind the need to achieve individual 
    autonomy and the cries of "Go for it!" was the same desire to be released 
    from the past. Within a year of the surrender more than three hundred 
    political parties appeared. Many of them stood for nothing more than a 
    single person's swollen ambition. Like the men on the trolley, they assumed 
    democracy meant everyone getting what he wanted. These one-man bands are 
    looked upon variously as good or bad measures of the postwar mood. But 
    surely there was something positive in their brief appearance. After all 
    they had been through, the Japanese were eager to take part in public life, 
    even if they had no understanding of a system that mediated between 
    individual desire and the rest of society. 
    <P>Americans tend to think that it was their example that got the Japanese 
    interested in democracy and the civic self. Certainly their arrival in Japan 
    had something to do with the rise of democratic expectations. But we must be 
    careful, once again, not to misunderstand the role of gaijin. Just as Japan 
    might have been better off without Commodore Perry's black ships, it might 
    have been better off without the occupation -- at least as it turned out. 
    Americans opened the door again, as it were, in 1945. But with the reverse 
    course they closed it. Democracy became a showpiece again, for we made it 
    impossible for the Japanese to build a civil society. We gave Japan a new 
    constitution full of liberal freedoms and civil rights, but then we brought 
    back the prewar elite, proven masters at manipulating "the beautiful 
    customs." 
    <P>No account of the postwar years captures its essential conflict as 
    thoughtfully as The Journey, a novel by Jiro Osaragi written at the end of 
    the 1950s. Osaragi never uses the term, but his real subject was shutai-sei. 
    His main characters struggle against all the old conventions. They fight to 
    make their own decisions, to rely upon themselves, to follow their own ideas 
    and passions. These are Japan's heroes, we are told by the aging professor 
    through whom the novelist speaks. In one passage the professor quotes an 
    ancient tea master: "I exhort you to do all those things in the world that 
    are bad." As with the Greeks and their vases, there is in these words an 
    appreciation of the flaws that signal authenticity in things of beauty or 
    worth, for the professor continues: 
    <P>The real point is that if a fellow can't do anything bad in this world, 
    he also can't do anything good. Human beings aren't meant to consist just of 
    style or appearance. We shouldn't become like mosquito-larvae bred in 
    lukewarm water under the sun. . . . No lukewarm methods! We don't want the 
    sort of fellows who just have conventional civilized educations. We need 
    people with chips and cracks, twisted in ways, but with uncommon characters. 

    <P>Osaragi ends in ascending chords. People pressed together by well-worn 
    social conventions diverge along separate paths, so embracing society's 
    multiplicity. But The Journey is no bedtime story. Other characters, seduced 
    by postwar materialism and superficial notions of American ideals, fail to 
    connect freedom with responsibility and end up submerged in the very morass 
    of self-centered getting and spending that Tokyo encouraged after the 
    anti-AMPO protests of 1960. 
    <P>Midway in the book a student who once dreamed of blazing scholarly trails 
    by tracing the path of Alexander the Great worries that his ambitions are 
    shrinking to idle fantasies: 
    <P>Apart from the process of growing up, the social uneasiness of the 
    postwar period was responsible for this shrinking process. The age of 
    individualism had come to Japan too late. It was an excellent thing, of 
    course, that the dignity of human rights had finally come to be respected. 
    But at exactly the same time Japan had entered the age in which it was 
    considered essential . . . that people suppress their egos and submit 
    themselves to a system of centralized organization. 
    <P>Osaragi was not a prophet, only a prescient recorder. By the end of the 
    1950s Japan was becoming a mass society. The old elite had entrenched 
    themselves once again, bringing with them the old notions of what it meant 
    to be Japanese. Under them the era of Japan Inc. began. 
    <P>The term shutai-sei is not much used anymore. In the 1960s it enjoyed a 
    vogue in the student movement. Opposed to the renewed social hierarchies in 
    which they lived, university demonstrators eventually took the issue to be 
    themselves and the edifices erected in their minds: uchi naru todai, the 
    Tokyo University within, uchi naru onnaishiki, the traditional woman within. 
    Community groups proliferated during this time. They engaged questions 
    ranging from the environment and nuclear power to textbook screening and 
    local political autonomy -- each one an indication of a widespread desire to 
    break free of the old constraints. A woman active through this period once 
    put it perfectly: "We wanted to live without always looking from one side to 
    the other, a habit planted deep within all of us." That the question of the 
    public self became explicitly political was no surprise. Public 
    individuality was always a political issue. The community groups eventually 
    disappeared, and the protests of the 1960s went the way of protest elsewhere 
    -- into radical adventure and obscurity. But the task before the Japanese 
    has since changed not an iota: It remains to throw away the masks while 
    tearing down the walls within. 
    <P>The psychiatrist Robert Jay Lifton, who has studied the Japanese for many 
    years, once interviewed a student who came of age in the 1960s. Like most of 
    his generation, the student was profoundly confused about the Japan that 
    confronted him and his true place in it. Before he was twenty-five Lifton's 
    subject had been in succession an ultranationalist patriot, a westernized 
    democrat, a martial arts devotee, an Amerophile exchange student, a 
    Christian, a leftist radical, and a dissipated idler. To the student these 
    were alternative selves, different ways of being, yet he seems to have 
    entered fully into none of his serial lives. They were roles or -- better, 
    perhaps -- different brands of modern life to be pulled from the shelf and 
    sampled. In the end he drifted into a desk job at a large corporation. 
    <P>Lifton exposed a prevalent condition -- the propensity of the modern 
    Japanese to dream. And like the dreams of the Meiji era, the dreams of the 
    postwar Japanese were always dreams of escape. Sararimen dreamed of striking 
    out on their own. They had a slangy contraction for this: datsu-sara, to 
    escape being a sarariman. It was usually enough to imagine such a step, so 
    the idea of datsu-sara was merely a popular fantasy. In the same way the 
    Japanese were famously obsessed with their entries in the Guinness Book of 
    Records. They sustained an elaborate subculture of dreamer-achievers: 
    climbers, trekkers in Africa, arctic explorers, single-handed sailors. Among 
    the best known was a man called Naomi Uemura, who soloed by sled to the 
    North Pole, lived alone in Greenland, and rafted the Amazon by himself. 
    Uemura died alone in the Canadian tundra, which only enhanced his mystique. 
    <P>Such preoccupations expressed an abiding desire among the Japanese to 
    release their individual selves. But as dreams, of course, they proved only 
    what they were intended to refute. The Japanese were still individuals who 
    could not live as individuals. Autonomy, as the scholar Masao Maruyama would 
    have put it, was still private. People had no public individuality. In 
    public they still wore masks: They assumed roles from which there was no 
    escape. "Many millions of people throughout Japan were sealed up in many 
    millions of separate boxes, or separated by many millions of walls." That 
    was how the educator Yukichi Fukuzawa described Japan just before the 
    restoration. It was also precisely the Japan Maruyama found after the war -- 
    and the Japan one found until a decade or so ago. 
    <P>Even now the Japanese share a profound ambivalence as to the need to 
    escape the web of belonging. But the conflict between freedom and community 
    has heightened dramatically over the past decade. In this Maruyama was 
    something of a prophet, for the best way to describe the Japanese condition 
    today is the way he described it fifty years ago: It requires that same 
    "internal reform of the psychological structure of society" of which he 
    wrote. That is to say, the line between the private and the public must be 
    redrawn so that the individuality that has been for so long furtive can be 
    manifest. As Maruyama understood, this is necessary not only for personal 
    autonomy to take root, but for democracy. Having neither an experience of 
    public individuality nor the mechanisms to express it, Japan is again 
    launched upon a messy experiment. "The underbelly of this exquisite society 
    is beginning to surface," Lifton remarked in the mid-1990s. "The Japanese 
    are seething within." This is a true description. It remains for us only to 
    recognize that Japan has seethed for a very long time. 
    <P>If the disintegration of the enveloping web is a gradual process -- as it 
    is, exceedingly so -- it is also unmistakable. One sees it in schools, 
    neighborhoods, offices, in a proliferation of subcultures of all varieties. 
    Less and less do people identify with their old, traditional groups. The 
    corporate samurai -- loyal, dedicated, the quinessential Japanese belonger 
    -- is already on the way to becoming a figure of the past. One sees evidence 
    of this change especially in the political world. Behind all the apparent 
    chaos -- the constantly shifting alliances, the rise and collapse of 
    parties, coalitions, and cabinets -- occurs the essential process of 
    building a system able to accommodate the historic emergence of the civic 
    self, "the new democratic human type," as Maruyama's modernists put it after 
    the war -- the unmasked, public individual. 
    <P>We have noted the practical circumstances surrounding this momentous 
    change. Japan has become the West's equal in material terms; the Cold War 
    has ended. But societies do not evolve -- not in any fundamental way -- 
    because of economic successes or an altered international climate. Like 
    Perry's black ships a century and a half ago, these are only catalysts at 
    work on agents of change already assembled. Societies change because the 
    people who comprise them want them to. And such is the truth with which the 
    Japanese now grapple, at once daunting and emancipating: People change 
    institutions; in the end it is not the other way around. 
    <P>The Japanese are much given to distinctions between generations. Each 
    seems to be a point of departure. Each seems to have some assigned task. In 
    recent years it has become impossible to discuss Japan without discussing 
    the ways it will change, but change is seen as the responsibility only of 
    the young. Others may desire it but feel no obligation to effect it. 
    "Change? Can Japan change?" an aging local official in western Japan once 
    said over lunch. "Our generation is haunted by the old. We must wait for the 
    next for change." This is not so, surely. Change cannot be but the 
    consequence of desire and effort accumulated over many generations and 
    transmitted from each to the next. 
    <P>A decade ago a new generation emerged in Japan: the shinjinrui, the "new 
    human species." The term described Japanese who seemed to be a people apart. 
    The new species knew nothing of postwar reconstruction or the turmoil of the 
    1950s and 1960s. They were the first Japanese to know only affluence. They 
    spent rather than saved, they felt no obligations toward society, they did 
    not care for corporate loyalty or lifetime employment. To their elders their 
    lack of vigor and direction was a source of worry. They seemed to have no 
    point of view, no identity, no political perspective -- nothing to 
    distinguish themselves except the blank stare of indifference toward Japan's 
    postwar values. By decade's end the rest of Japan simply shrugged, and the 
    new species became passé. They seemed to reflect something familiar on the 
    Japanese scene: the conformity of sanctioned nonconformity. Corporations 
    reduced the shinjinrui to a marketing conundrum. The man who gave the new 
    human species their name, a writer named Tetsuya Chikushi, repudiated it, 
    saying there was nothing new about them after all. 
    <P>We must wait to see if this is so, for it is not so easy to dismiss the 
    shinjinrui. Rather, we must separate what is ephemeral about them from the 
    things that are of lasting importance. Without even meaning to, the new 
    species announced the end of "the modern" in Japan, the modern as the 
    Japanese had understood it for a century and a quarter. Viscerally, they 
    seemed to recognize that the past was somehow over and that they represented 
    a decisive break with it. Their parents had completed the modernization 
    project. It was the new species who, detached from history, could finally 
    see the great price the Japanese paid for material success. This was their 
    paradox: They consumed with abandon, for that was life's only reward -- but 
    always, it seemed to me, with a certain bitter contempt for consumption. 
    <P>Many of the new species are no doubt sararimen by now, having drifted 
    into corporate life as indifferently as Lifton's fickle student. But that is 
    not the point. When one spoke with them, the people of this generation 
    almost invariably explained that their primary concern was to reclaim time. 
    What did they mean by this? Certainly it was not a matter of the passing 
    hours and days. It was the way modern life has been divided in Japan. To 
    reclaim time meant to assert control over themselves as individuals, to 
    redraw the line between public and private -- to make private life 
    acceptable, not furtive and secret, and to live publicly as authentic, 
    autonomous individuals. 
    <P>Understood this way, the new species was aptly named. Its members 
    signaled, it seems to me, the start of a fundamental renegotiation of the 
    terms of Japanese life. They repudiated nothing less than the community 
    ethos that has so long bound the Japanese -- and so proposed a new way of 
    being an individual that had nothing to do with being Japanese. They made 
    the refusal to wear the Japanese mask the act not of a mountain-climbing 
    hero but of an ordinary person. And they began, in all this, the final 
    chapter of Japan's hidden history. That is why there is scarcely an aspect 
    of Japanese society that is not now in flux. 
    <P>"It is not true that we refuse to make any effort," one of the new 
    species once explained. "We are dedicated to finding something worth making 
    an effort for." The notion invites a useful comparison with the Association 
    of New Men, the group that pressed, during the 1920s, for a fundamental 
    renovation of modern Japan. Unlike the New Men, the new species has had no 
    apparent political agenda -- and certainly it has no organization. But the 
    new species resembles the New Men in its advocacy of alternative ways of 
    thinking and living. The project of the New Men was to partake of a society 
    still in formation. The shinjinrui, by contrast, have confronted an 
    altogether fixed society. They have sought not the right to participate in 
    Japan as it has constructed itself but to quit that Japan in favor of one 
    that admits of autonomy and multiplicity. let us return briefly to the 
    matter of names. From this story of names, names printed on paper, we learn 
    the point of transition the Japanese have reached -- a peculiar place, but 
    one from which there does not seem to be any turning back. 
    <P>Meishi, business cards, are essential equipment in modern Japan. They 
    tell you not only a person's name and affiliation but -- most important -- 
    his rank within the hierarchy. Without some indication of status, two 
    Japanese would have a difficult time because they would not know the proper 
    behavior. Who stands above whom? How deep should the bow be? You can fill 
    drawers with meishi in the course of a busy year in Japan. Even the most 
    casual encounters require exchanges of cards; the code they supply is 
    essential. Is the meishi not in some way analogous to the samurai's dress -- 
    the meticulously displayed colors and patterns by which he identified 
    himself? 
    <P>The most interesting meishi I ever received was from a sarariman at the 
    Nikken Corporation. Nikken was a going concern in the early 1990s; perhaps 
    it still is. It did a thriving business leasing office equipment and 
    industrial machinery. It had three factories, 160 sales offices, and almost 
    two thousand employees. There were subsidiaries in Chicago and Bangkok and a 
    listing on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Yearly revenue came to 60 billion yen, 
    about $600 million. 
    <P>The man from Nikken who handed me his meishi was thirtyish, a "new human 
    species." One side of his card read taro honmaru, general manager. On the 
    other it read my real name is keiichi nakamura. What did it mean that a 
    young Japanese executive had two names? 
    <P>The system started naturally enough. After hiring a nephew with the same 
    surname, Nikken's president soon tired of the confusion. So he called his 
    nephew Imafuku-san, after the younger man's hometown. The characters for 
    "Imafuku" happen to translate as "now luck," a fortuitous stroke, for it 
    yielded a lasting nickname. And so the system evolved. The president was 
    called Kane (Turtle), for his tough demeanor. An executive from a mountain 
    village named himself Kodama-san, kodama being the echo heard across peaks. 
    There was a sports fan called Rikishi-san (because rikishi is another name 
    for a sumo wrestler) and a Hitomi Sakura (Iris Cherry Blossom). The general 
    manager who explained all this was Honmaru-san because he worked in the head 
    office's planning section. Honmaru were the central towers in the castles of 
    the feudal daimyo. 
    <P>Honmaru-san, tall and boyish, was much taken with the curiosities: the 
    confusion at business hotels, the computer directory where real and invented 
    names were matched. He did not seem to have considered what such a system 
    said about Japan and the Japanese, or what it meant that one's real name 
    represented the private, authentic self, and the made-up name the public 
    self, the mask. Then, in his polite, diffident manner, he began to explain. 
    We sat across from each other at a Formica-topped table in a bare conference 
    room. 
    <P>"One reason we do this -- perhaps it's very Japanese -- is that a lot of 
    sararimen get confused between their private and public selves. They want to 
    separate the two clearly. While at work, you should have the dedication of 
    the professional businessman -- the so-called corporate warrior. After five, 
    you should return to your real self and do what you want to do." 
    <P>Honmaru paused to judge my reaction before drawing his conclusion. "The 
    Japanese are like actors," he said finally. "Actors can't refuse a role. You 
    can't refuse your part in Japan." 
    <P>Actors cannot refuse roles, but ordinary people can. <B>

    <UL><B>Education</B> in Japan is not intended to create people 
      accomplished in the techniques of the arts and sciences, but rather to 
      manufacture the persons required by the State.<BR>-- Arinori Mori, Japan's 
      first <B>education</B> minister, 1885</UL>
    <P>Yosuke kobayashi has a stocky build, an intent gaze, and the bristly crew 
    cut favored by aging nationalists. In conversation he brooks no hesitation, 
    no pause for thought. Sitting around a kerosene stove with a half dozen 
    colleagues, he is their self-appointed spokesman. He smiles easily but, son 
    of a farmer, guards his self-possession and pride. 
    <P>Yosuke Kobayashi is seven. He is in second grade at Sakai elementary 
    school, a two-story brick building down a narrow road in a village whose 
    name, Fujimi, celebrates its distant view of Mount Fuji. 
    <P>Fujimi, a community of farmers and factory workers in Nagano Prefecture, 
    is below freezing in January. From the sloping streets in the center of 
    town, you can see well-packed ski trails across the valley below; the winter 
    Olympics will be played not far away in 1998. The lights of a distant 
    ryokan, a traditional inn, flicker even in the daytime. At Sakai there is a 
    crust of snow several inches deep, and the drive in is solid ice. 
    <P>Yosuke Kobayashi's problem, one shared with six classmates on a windy 
    Wednesday morning, is wet feet. All seven of them have retreated from the 
    playground, shoes off, stockinged feet to the stove. They are reading 
    quietly when I arrive. 
    <P>"What do you do after school? Play on the farm with the animals?" 
    <P>"I do homework or play with the family computer," says Yosuke Kobayashi, 
    pleased to contradict. 
    <P>"What about when you grow up? What then?" 
    <P>"A sensei!" Kobayashi exclaims. "I want to be a teacher." 
    <P>The others consider the question and finally get a word in edgewise. 
    There are two aspiring bookstore owners, a novelist, and one who wants to 
    take care of children. The two others, perhaps reticent in front of a 
    gaijin, cannot really say. 
    <P>"Nobody wants to be a sarariman?" 
    <P>"I wanted to be a sarariman last month," Kobayashi puts in. 
    <P>"What made you change your mind?" 
    <P>"I always change my mind. I only wanted to be one for a little while." 
    <P>Yosuke Kobayashi and his friends look upon life as an event of infinite 
    choices. They all, it turns out, always change their minds. Even the shy 
    ones grin uncontrollably as if in delight with this enviable privilege. 
    Their clothes, of bright colors and carefree styles, convey the same 
    exuberance: yellow ski parkas, red socks, green sweaters, woollen caps a 
    near riot of hues. 
    <P>"Who sent you in here?" 
    <P>"We came in by ourselves," answers Yosuke Kobayashi. 
    <P>"No one told you to?" 
    <P>"We had wet feet. It's common sense." 
    <P>"You just did it. No one told you." 
    <P>"We told the teacher first." 
    <P>I went to Sakai to meet Japanese schoolchildren. And Yosuke Kobayashi and 
    his friends were Japanese, of course -- born in Japan of Japanese parentage. 
    But it was hard to find anything about them that was Japanese as we 
    ordinarily use the term. They were in full command of that personal autonomy 
    most Japanese find so elusive. They had no particular attitude toward 
    authority. They were not especially concerned about being part of the group. 
    And they wore no masks. 
    <P>Not far from Sakai elementary, Minami middle school is an altogether more 
    austere institution. Its front entrance is wide open to the cold: physical 
    hardship as the instructor of the will. The hallways, unheated, with floors 
    of worn wood, are spotless: They are mopped every afternoon by platoons of 
    students, who mumble a greeting -- Konichiwa, good day -- with uniform, 
    eyes-to-the-floor diffidence. 
    <P>Students at Minami all wear the same dark tunics (fashioned after old 
    Prussian military garb), the same blouses and jumpers, the same hairstyles, 
    the same sneakers, socks of the same make and precisely the same height. 
    Identical book bags hang from wooden pegs around the classrooms. Posters 
    explain the proper methods of study: Use thick pencils, one advises; with a 
    dotted-line diagram, another shows the exact distance (thirty centimeters) 
    to be maintained between the eye and the page. 
    <P>Later I receive a copy of Minami's regulations. Rule 1: "Be punctual and 
    moderate." Rule 2 concerns clothing and appearance. The school badge and a 
    name card are to be pinned to the left breast; shoes must be of the approved 
    variety. "Boys' hair is not to cover the ears and brow. Girls' hair is not 
    to cover the eyes. When binding hair, rubber bands are to be black, navy, or 
    dark brown." Other rules have to do with motorbikes and pinball parlors 
    (prohibited), part-time work (to be approved by the principal), and leaving 
    the village (not without adult supervision). 
    <P>In a social science class they are studying Suwa, the feudal name for the 
    district; for a brief period in the eighth century the area was a separate 
    nation called Suho. At the end there is a four-question quiz:
    <P>
    <UL>1.&nbsp;Please write something about the Suwa 
      area.<BR>2.&nbsp;Describe Suwa during the Nara and Heian 
      eras.<BR>3.&nbsp;What do you think of Suho-koku?<BR>4.&nbsp;What would you 
      like to study about ancient Suwa?
      <P></P></UL>
    <P>In an English class two old telephone sets sit on the teacher's desk. 
    Pairs of seventh-graders take turns at them. 
    <P>"Hello," one conversation begins. 
    <P>"Hello." 
    <P>(Long pause; nervous confusion.) 
    <P>"Are you free?" 
    <P>"Yes, I am." 
    <P>(Another long pause.) 
    <P>"Do you . . . do you like baseball?" 
    <P>"Yes." 
    <P>(Pause, then haste.) 
    <P>"Good-bye." 
    <P>"Good-bye." 
    <P>It is surprising to see instruction in local history -- it suggests a 
    departure from the heavy weight of central control for which Japanese 
    schools are known. And the quiz: It requires thought and imagination. The 
    Japanese normally learn by rote, advancing simply by repeating what they are 
    told. 
    <P>The lurching uncertainty in the English class is closer to what I 
    expected to find at Minami. True, this is their first year of language study 
    -- the first of a minimum of six. But the anguished pauses are otherwise 
    explained: They reveal the confusion the Japanese typically feel in the face 
    of the unplanned. The Japanese learn to perform only when the script is 
    written. Put them in a situation requiring a flexible response -- when the 
    next thought, the next statement, the next act is up to them -- and they 
    come unhinged. How unlike young Kobayashi-san and his friends at Sakai, who 
    think for themselves and manage their own small affairs. 
    <P>The Japanese consider freedom the right only of the very young. Japan 
    draws a circle around them, a container within which they are unexposed to 
    either social or psychological limits. Inside the container they are the 
    emperors and empresses of daily life. The Chinese, too, are famously 
    indulgent of their children. But only in Japan would a parent say, "Our 
    young are free because we know the rest of their lives will be burdensome." 
    <P>One hears such sentiments often. But young children enjoy an attenuated 
    freedom, after all, because it is given (and eventually taken away) by those 
    above -- parents, teachers, administrators. For all their independence of 
    spirit, Yosuke Kobayashi and his friends were also getting their first 
    lessons in dependence -- the dependence upon authority that has been 
    characteristic of the Japanese personality for many centuries. 
    <P>It is as the young exit the container that freedom is gradually withdrawn 
    and the submissive personality takes its lifelong form. Could there be a 
    question more laden with unconscious irony than the first one posed in the 
    conversation drill: "Are you free?" To become nihonjin, to become a 
    Japanese, does not mean becoming an ordinary person. And it is the inverse 
    of the comparable process in the West: Adulthood is measured not by the 
    achievement of ever greater degrees of independence, but in the acceptance 
    of the process by which choices are narrowed until there are none. 
    <P>The principal in each of the schools I visited spoke earnestly of the 
    ideals of liberal learning. "Truth is not just scientific facts," said 
    Toshio Iijima, who ran Minami middle school. "It's also how to arrive at the 
    truth by oneself in daily life. We want students to find problems in nature 
    and solve them." 
    <P>Teachers all over Japan announce similar beliefs. The problem with most 
    such assertions is the old one in Japan, the distance between the ideal and 
    the real. Most educators are at ease explaining their admirable thoughts 
    about <B>education</B>, especially to gaijin, because of how they learned 
    them: by rote. This often becomes clear as conversations go on. 
    <P>"My duty is to make students grow into adults who can support the 
    nation," Yu Hosono, an orderly but relaxed man in his fifties, told me at 
    Sakai elementary. "My basic principle is 'Everyone can play any role.'" 
    <P>That may not be a bad description of an educator's duty, depending on 
    your perspective. But there is a danger in it, the danger Yukichi Fukuzawa 
    ran into during the Meiji era: the contradiction between human development 
    for its own sake and development for the sake of a strong country. After a 
    century and a quarter of modern <B>education</B> Japan has yet to resolve 
    this contradiction. It will do so: The Japanese are too restless, there is 
    too much discontent in the schools, and the nation's economic imperatives 
    are changing too drastically for there to be any other conclusion. But it 
    will not be an easy resolution, or a quick one. 
    <P>Today Japanese schools are a battlefield. This is not surprising; beneath 
    the surface, most Japanese institutions are. At stake when teachers clash 
    with bureaucrats, when students drop out, or when intellectuals take the 
    <B>Education</B> Ministry to court over the content of national textbooks is 
    nothing less than the kinds of people the Japanese are permitted to become. 
    <P>Haven't Japanese schools produced the men and women who have built the 
    world's second-largest economy? Yes -- and the straight-line equation the 
    question implies is precisely the problem. Look at <B>education</B> from the 
    perspective of individual development, and the story of modern Japanese 
    schooling immediately becomes one of truncated opportunity and stunted 
    personal growth. Schools are merely preparation for the ceaseless assault on 
    the individual that the Japanese must accept as part of the adult burden. 
    <P>At Minami middle school, Iijima-sensei, thin, balding, and intent, had a 
    more precise vision than Hosono of the system he worked within -- and a more 
    accurate one, at least for the moment. "Learning the truth is important," he 
    said. "But learning to be Japanese is very important." westerners do not see 
    the danger inherent in a system dedicated to building a population that can 
    serve the nation. We associate <B>education</B> with liberal values -- 
    knowledge, rational inquiry, civility, civic-mindedness. We have our debates 
    as to what ought to be taught and how; but we tend not to think of 
    <B>education</B> as an empty vessel that can be filled with just about 
    anything. Serving the nation may or may not be a fine idea. That judgment 
    must always depend on the nation, and how it is to be served. 
    <P>This is an extraordinary lapse, particularly for Americans. The 
    occupation officials at G.H.Q. in late 1945 were horrified at what went on 
    in Japanese schools. Emperor worship, Japanist ideology, state Shinto: 
    Schools were building the old edifice within, as everyone saw. It was to 
    dismantle the internal edifice that Americans were eager to teach the 
    Japanese square dancing, billiards, and other ordinary pastimes. Less 
    quaintly, the same zeal was reflected in the occupation's <B>education</B> 
    reforms, which were among the most sweeping of its programs. Almost all of 
    those reforms, however, were pushed aside after the reverse course. Then we 
    began to kid ourselves. We still count the changes we made in Japanese 
    schools among our great legacies. Of course, it has been convenient to 
    maintain this fiction. It is a large part of our imaginary "Japan." 
    <P>William Bennett, President Reagan's <B>education</B> secretary, issued a 
    report in 1987 called Japanese <B>Education</B> Today. It was Bennett's 
    indirect contribution to the heated argument among Americans about the 
    collapse of their public schools. "Our educational ideals are better 
    realized on a large scale in Japan than observers have tended to realize," 
    he noted. Bennett admired the Japanese system; its excellence, so far as he 
    was concerned, reflected America's postwar influences. "It is the American 
    belief in the value of universal <B>education</B> that the Japanese have so 
    successfully put into practice, and the American quandary over 'equality' 
    and 'excellence' that the Japanese seem rather satisfactorily to have 
    resolved." 
    <P>That the Japanese learned the value of universal <B>education</B> from 
    the occupation is among the hollowest of America's conceits. Official Japan 
    has long found universal <B>education</B> desirable -- for its use if not 
    its value. But Bennett was merely repeating the orthodoxy. The same year he 
    issued Japanese <B>Education</B> Today, a Harvard lecturer named Merry White 
    published The Japanese Educational Challenge: A Commitment to Children, a 
    book that posed some excellent questions: 
    <P>In Japan the care of children is not regarded as just a domestic concern. 
    Indeed the entire nation is mobilized behind children and their 
    <B>education</B>. This national obsession may well be responsible for 
    children Western parents and educators would be proud of, children whose 
    lives and future prospects meet our standards of approval. In short, the 
    Japanese national engagement in child development is something we should 
    envy. 
    <P>What has fueled the drive to maximize the life chances of children? How 
    does the intense commitment to children mirror the nation's conception of 
    its past, present, and future? 
    <P>Unfortunately, White's study neglects to answer her excellent questions. 
    Instead her book veers off into explanations of educational "scarcity," 
    pervasive feelings of insecurity in an agrarian society, and (quoting a 
    teacher) "Japan's moral 'common sense.'" 
    <P>Many statistics suggest the superiority of Japanese schools. Japanese 
    pupils average seven hours of instruction a day and two hours of homework; 
    Americans average five hours and twenty minutes in school and twenty-five 
    minutes at homework. School-age Japanese read for twenty-five minutes daily 
    -- two and a half times what American children give to books. Japanese 
    teachers are better prepared than their American counterparts. By any 
    measure the Japanese student is more literate and more numerate than the 
    American schoolchild. 
    <P>But how and why do Japanese pupils become so notably disciplined -- and 
    to what purpose? What habits of mind do they acquire? What sacrifices are 
    forced upon them? What are they like when they finish school -- or (better 
    put, perhaps) when school finishes with them? If we answer these questions, 
    or the questions White poses, we might wonder whether the experiences and 
    prospects of Japanese children would "meet our standards of approval." 
    <P>With history in view it is irresponsible, to say the least, to assert 
    that "the entire nation is mobilized behind children and their 
    <B>education</B>," and that Americans ought to envy this "national 
    engagement." National engagement in <B>education</B> dates to Meiji. From 
    the 1930s onward it was a form of coercion, an essential tool in Japan's 
    version of fascist totality. And the continuity between Japan's pre- and 
    postwar <B>education</B> systems is nowhere considered even debatable. 
    <P>Violence in schools -- in America and to a lesser extent elsewhere in the 
    West -- is one reason we are encouraged to admire the Japanese system. But 
    violence (rendered by both students and teachers) is common in Japan. It is 
    only more institutional -- better dressed. Every year the newspapers report 
    incidents that seem to border on sadism: A seventeen-year-old's spleen is 
    ruptured when a teacher kicks him in the stomach for reading a comic book; a 
    thirteen-year-old suffocates when other students roll him in a gym mat and 
    stuff him upside down into a closet. Teachers are reported to inflict more 
    than a hundred skull fractures, sprains, broken bones, and the like each 
    year. Ijime, student bullying, is a peculiarly Japanese problem. It is 
    rampant in the school system: More than twenty-two thousand cases are 
    reported annually. 
    <P>These sort of things help to explain much about Japanese schools. There 
    are troubling rashes of suicides among schoolchildren, for instance -- a 
    dozen in 1995. The dropout rate averages twenty students annually at every 
    high school in the country; one student in six struggles with alcohol; 
    truancy cases hover at just under 5 percent of all students because children 
    in the tens of thousands simply refuse to subject themselves to Japan's 
    educational regime. These numbers climbed dramatically during the 1980s and 
    were at record highs in the mid-1990s. 
    <P>We are rarely encouraged to think of truancy, violence, and drinking as 
    endemic problems in Japanese schools. When these matters come up, they are 
    placed somewhere in the statistical fringe -- odd occurrences bound to 
    happen in any large system. It would be wrong to suggest that Japanese 
    schools are either dangerous or empty. They are not. But, once again, we 
    cannot simply leave the statistics sitting there without explanation. 
    Violence, the dropout rate, and other problems are symptoms of disorders 
    that affect a vast number of students who never appear in the statistics. 
    <P>The core problem is evident in the very term used for "<B>education</B>." 
    Kyoiku is written in two characters, the first meaning "to impart" and the 
    second "to develop." In the difference between the two lies the tragic 
    failure of Japanese schools. Teaching methods, textbooks, and curricula, 
    from ethics and history to morning exercise routines, are decided by the 
    <B>Education</B> Ministry. All stress the dictation of knowledge to the 
    neglect of the student's ability to manage knowledge -- that is, the kyo at 
    the expense of the iku. Pupils are taught not to think but to accumulate 
    immense piles of disparate facts that can be repeated on command but cannot 
    be connected. This is not an accident or a lapse. Rote learning is the 
    child's next lesson in dependence. To think is an act of autonomy; to 
    memorize the given is to rely upon authority. 
    <P>Rote learning is measured by an intensely competitive examination system. 
    Exams are a typical feature of Confucian meritocracies. They are 
    administered not at the conclusion of a course of study but as entrance 
    requirements. The Chinese used exams to select bureaucrats. The Japanese 
    apply them to everybody, which leads to a peculiar kind of competition: It 
    all takes place at once, and then it is over. This is why students spend 
    much of their time in a state of intense preparation called "exam hell." One 
    will either pass or fail, with no second chance to display improvement. 
    Individual achievement is not the point; the point is merely to enter the 
    school whose diploma accords the most privilege and social recognition -- a 
    very different thing. 
    <P>Savage competition and force-fed information without the cultivation of 
    critical thought go far to explain the character of Japanese graduates. The 
    system's demands -- years in exam hell, every other student an adversary -- 
    produce not exploring intellects but the narrow, machinelike people we 
    assume the Japanese to be by nature. Wholly focused on achieving the highest 
    possible place in the hierarchy, they are unable to form healthy ties with 
    equals -- horizontal relationships. They are indifferent to most public 
    issues because they are unnaturally inward looking and (by official design) 
    ignorant of large patches of their own history. Outside of a few 
    conventional settings -- karaoke bars are one -- they display little sense 
    of autonomy. 
    <P>Those who stay the course become shakai-jin, social beings, people 
    conditioned to live in society. What have they learned? What is considered 
    important to live in Japan? To keep their individuality private. To 
    persevere, to soldier on in the face of adversity. And to conform. These are 
    essential habits for the successful nihonjin. They explain why bullying and 
    physical punishment, while officially condemned, remain so ordinary. The 
    <B>Education</B> Ministry does little about them, except in the most extreme 
    cases, because they are the best way to get the message across. 
    <P>In Kobe I met a psychiatrist named Masao Miyamoto, who had been trained 
    at Cornell Medical and practiced in America for a decade before returning to 
    Japan. He had been working for the Health Ministry for seven years. 
    Miyamoto's problem was simple: He was detribalized. His life was a kind of 
    hell until he learned to cope with the relentless demands of sameness by 
    resisting them, then ignoring them, and later writing about them. Miyamoto 
    wore bright neckties. He went to dinner with his minister and some 
    colleagues and ordered a different plate than the others. He did not work 
    overtime and took all of his allotted vacation. The price was ostracism and 
    ijime, bullying. And when he began publishing his observations about the 
    difficulties he found in Japan after living abroad, he was invited to resign 
    -- not because his remarks were untrue but because he had betrayed his group 
    to outsiders. 
    <P>Bullying does not end at graduation. In one form or another it is part of 
    every nihonjin's existence from school days onward. Miyamoto called it "a 
    sadistic impulse which seeks to bring straying sheep back into the fold." 
    But how did his bureaucratic superior see things? "That's not bullying," 
    Miyamoto was told. "We call it discipline. It's because of our loving 
    feeling toward you that we want to acclimate you to the environment as 
    quickly as possible. You simply don't understand our affection." 
    <P>These two explanations of ijime do not contradict each other. Bullying is 
    cruel and loving at the same time because at the root of both lies 
    narcissism. To acquire a certain narcissism is a fundamental part of 
    becoming nihonjin: One takes on the fear of difference and -- the other side 
    of the coin -- the drive to see oneself reflected in all others. Doesn't 
    turning little boys like Yosuke Kobayashi into "social beings" involve both 
    bullying and love -- both administered by society in heavy doses? The 
    necessity of narcissism explains, in psychological terms, the suppression of 
    public individuality. "You are allowed to have divergent thoughts," Miyamoto 
    said of his work in the bureaucracy, "as long as they are not publicly 
    expressed." 
    <P>Among the most curious people to appear during the late 1980s were a 
    group in their teens and twenties called otaku. Otaku is one of many terms 
    for "you." In its ancient meaning it was used to address someone from 
    another ie (extended household) and implied that one was unconcerned with 
    the details of the other person's family and circumstances. To use it was to 
    say, "We are from different houses. We have only this encounter in common." 
    The word objectified the other while preserving the illusion of sameness. It 
    prevented the discovery that there were differences between subject and 
    object, "I" and "you." 
    <P>Otaku today apply the term to those who share an obsession. They take 
    their name from the old pronoun because they use it to mean, "I am not 
    interested in you or your inner life. I share with you only our narrow 
    interest." An otaku's obsession is highly cultivated. It might be a deceased 
    pop star, a cartoonist, rail schedules, or outer-space aliens. Computers are 
    a favorite obsession. It does not matter as long as one knows the finest 
    details of one's interest, preferably an obscure interest. I once ran into a 
    group of otaku waiting at some subway stairs in the Roppongi bar district 
    for a rock singer no one had heard of for years. Each one carried a rose. 
    What were they expecting, I asked. They were sure he would emerge from the 
    next train, at precisely 9:05, on his way to a party at such-and-such an 
    address. 
    <P>The otaku are an extreme group. But they cannot be ignored as marginal. 
    Most university students display some attributes of the otaku, and many 
    continue on with their obsessions as young professionals in their twenties. 
    To be an otaku is merely the final word in private individuality. It is to 
    reject anyone who would diminish the protected ego and to acknowledge an 
    inability to achieve the intimacy of authentic human contact. The otaku 
    draws a circle around himself -- that fundamentally Japanese impulse -- and 
    withdraws within. He (almost all otaku are male) refuses knowledge of those 
    who share his compulsion because the details of anyone's life would force 
    the conclusion that even an otaku partner is an "other." 
    <P>This is the purest imaginable display of the narcissism inherent in 
    Japanese society. The otaku desires both an idealized union and an 
    impregnable independence -- the classic drives of the narcissist. He seems 
    postmodern and marginal but is deeply traditional in his rejection of the 
    unfamiliar. Students in the ancient schools of tea ceremony were like otaku. 
    Every member had to be a mirror of every other member. The otaku represent 
    rebellion as parodic conformity. 
    <P>And how does the otaku spend his time? Like the typical Japanese student: 
    accumulating disconnected (and therefore useless) facts. His fixation is a 
    postmodern joke -- the punch line being the meaninglessness of what passes 
    for meaning in contemporary Japan. He is at once protesting what and how he 
    has "learned," and performing an act of profound conformity and submission. 
    Perseverance is an enviable virtue; one may even take conformity to be one. 
    But it is another matter to envy these qualities once one understands how 
    they are inculcated. The otaku show us that perseverance and conformity, 
    both of which they possess, are like <B>education</B>: They can be good or 
    bad. 
    <P>The notion that Japanese graduates look out upon a bright, enviable 
    future applies to a sliver of the 40 percent of students who attend 
    university -- the graduates of Tokyo University, say, or a handful of other 
    institutions. But we ought to question whether even the privileged few are 
    to be envied. Our efficient Japan, the "Japan" of Japan Inc., rests on a 
    false picture. Graduates of Todai, as Tokyo University is familiarly known, 
    are subject to the same dreary pressure to conform as everyone else once 
    they begin moving through the system; if anything, such pressure is greater 
    on them, for they are Japan's exemplars. Dr. Miyamoto's experience is 
    typical of the Todai graduate's in all respects but one: Unable either to 
    conform or resist, he spent his first year at the Health Ministry nursing 
    gastritis and insomnia. 
    <P>This sketch of the Japanese system can surprise only those who accept the 
    conventional wisdom without questioning it, or who do not wish to see Japan 
    as it is. Only in the West -- from afar, where one sees the shiny surface of 
    things but not the grim detail beneath -- do people want to take credit for 
    the Japanese system. In Japan the question is blame. How did our schools 
    come to such a sorry state? they ask. No one any longer even pretends they 
    work properly. But there the agreement ends, for solutions to the problem 
    are widely varied. 
    <P>Arinori Mori, Japan's first <B>education</B> minister, could not have 
    foreseen the truants and the dropouts -- to say nothing of the otaku. The 
    record suggests he would have been horrified. But what is contested in 
    schools, what lies behind these morbid symptoms, is the very notion 
    contained in Mori's quotation at the beginning of this chapter. 
    <B>Education</B> in modern Japan was to produce -- "manufacture" -- people 
    more akin to machines than inquiring individuals. A century after his death, 
    Japan has still not resolved the simple but fundamental problem of which 
    serves the other, the individual or the state. Can anyone wonder that the 
    descendant of Mori's system is among the most contentious in the industrial 
    world? 
    <P>Arinori mori had the way of the warrior in his blood. His 
    <B>education</B>, as the son of a samurai, had much in common with a pupil's 
    routine today: Up at six for sixteen hours of memorization and rote 
    recitation -- "without particular attention to meaning," his biographer 
    tells us. Tears when his recall failed. Plenty of physical rigor -- chores, 
    the martial arts, occasional war games in the dark. He did not leave the 
    fiefdom where his father served in the bureaucracy until he was eighteen. 
    <P>For most of the next decade Mori was abroad: England, the Continent, 
    America. And from these travels another Mori emerged. A photograph taken in 
    1872, four years after the restoration, shows a confident, exceptionally 
    handsome man: a set gaze, flowing hair in the English-aesthete style, 
    perfect bones, a well-trimmed beard. He wears a suit with wide lapels, a 
    silk four-in-hand tied neatly at his neck. Mori was twenty-five and halfway 
    through a three-year tour as Tokyo's first minister to Washington. 
    <P>Was he a champion of "civilization," or a xenophobic samurai? Or perhaps 
    the question is backwards: A craven imitator of the West, or an excellent 
    steward of the great Japanese tradition? 
    <P>Mori knew the West, arguably, more intimately than any other Meiji 
    figure. Japan needed to absorb all it could, he preached -- to evident 
    excess. He advised young Japanese studying in the United States to improve 
    the nation's gene pool by taking American wives; he wanted to scrap nihongo 
    ("our meager language") so the Japanese would converse ever after in 
    English. He was the first Japanese to marry in Western style and, giving his 
    wife the rights then accorded in America, to set her free of Confucian 
    ignominy. His favorite pastime was billiards, learned (along with much else) 
    from Herbert Spencer, the English sociologist, at the Athenaeum Club in 
    London. Hirobumi Ito, the first premier, called Mori "a Westerner born in 
    Japan." 
    <P>Then the other Mori reemerged. He divorced, then remarried in Japanese 
    style. He became an ardent patriot. Mori's schools taught the kokutai, the 
    national essence; the emperor's image hung in every one, his words on 
    <B>education</B> recited frequently. Textbook censors were busy. There was 
    no such thing as an individual who happened to be Japanese and who learned 
    for the sake of learning -- only nihonjin, who learned for the sake of 
    Japan. 
    <P>Mori's death was as contradictory as his life. In 1887 he went to the 
    sacred shrines at Ise, south of Tokyo. The visit was in earnest, we may 
    assume, but Mori botched the protocol. On entering he failed to remove his 
    shoes; then he used his walking stick to part a sacred veil no mortal was to 
    touch. So it was said: The details are lost. Two years later, on the day the 
    emperor was to give Japan its new constitution, Mori was stabbed by a 
    fanatic nationalist, a fallen samurai like himself, in revenge for the Ise 
    incident. The newspapers made the assassin a martyr for ridding Japan of a 
    sellout -- a closet Christian, rumors in high places had it. The public did 
    not know whether to pay respects at the grave of the honorable minister or 
    of the fanatic nationalist, among the first of the modern breed, who killed 
    him. 
    <P>Early biographers sought to pin down the great switch in Mori's mind: His 
    influences changed from America, a riot of individual enterprise during the 
    Meiji years, to the new and nationalist Germany; he seemed to leave behind 
    the liberalism of youth for the traditionalist within. But there was no such 
    advance and retreat, no progress or regress. Mori seems to have held all his 
    views at once -- never bothering (or unable, perhaps) to reconcile the 
    contradictions. Nationalist always, a statist at his ministry, Mori thought 
    Japan should nonetheless be like the West he had traveled through: a place 
    of open relationships, lively intellectual exchange, civic awareness -- in 
    short, a public Japan. Individual to the point of eccentricity in his 
    personal habits (another source of suspicion among colleagues), Mori seems 
    nevertheless not to have established the kind of sovereign self the novelist 
    Soseki Natsume talked about. 
    <P>Mori's life is a kind of biography of Meiji. If we cannot find a name for 
    Mori we cannot attach one to his age. His confusion was everybody's. His 
    "dual structure of the spirit" -- the gentle phrase of a later historian -- 
    was precisely modern Japan's. But he never quite outgrew the long days and 
    nights as a samurai-in-training, and so ended up inflicting a version of his 
    own experience on the whole country. And the human tragedy of the 
    modernization project -- its immense missed opportunities -- was nowhere 
    more evident than in Mori's schools. 
    <P>Upon his return from Washington in 1873, Mori began the Meiji Six 
    Society, so named for its founding year by the imperial calendar: the sixth 
    year of Meiji. Made up of liberal intellectuals and publisher of its own 
    magazine, Meiji Six quickly became the center of the "civilization and 
    enlightenment" movement. Yukichi Fukuzawa, champion of "the spirit of 
    independence," was prominent among Meiji Six's members. He and Mori were 
    friends. But they stood on either side of the Meiji era's great divide over 
    education. And the chasm between them first emerged in the group. 
    <P>In 1875 the new government issued the first in a line of libel laws and 
    newspaper regulations intended to limit free speech and the spread of 
    political discussion among ordinary Japanese. Sweeping but vaguely worded, 
    they portended Japan's imminent change in direction. Reflecting on the Meiji 
    Six Society, Mori advised his colleagues: 
    <P>It was not originally the intention at the founding of our society . . . 
    that the discussion would relate to contemporary political matters. Thus let 
    us be careful in the future to avoid becoming embroiled in such 
    controversies. 
    <P>Was this not akin to telling people to discuss their discovery of an 
    ocean without reference to water? How could one discuss modern Japan's birth 
    from feudalism without discussing politics? Fukuzawa was incensed; he saw no 
    point in going any further. Meiji Six, for two years an influential voice in 
    the new Japan, ceased publishing its monthly shortly after Mori's critique 
    and dissolved entirely three months later. 
    <P>What was the essential quarrel between Mori and Fukuzawa? Press 
    censorship? If so, Fukuzawa would surely have argued for continued 
    publication. The core issue was the ban on political discourse. Behind 
    Mori's idea was the assumption that certain things were to be considered 
    only in the restricted upper reaches of society. And behind that assumption 
    lay another: that the motor of the new Japan, the source of its ideas and 
    direction, was not the common majority but the educated elite. The 
    implications were enormous. In our terminology modern Japan was to be 
    top-down, not bottom-up. In the school system this idea produced a sharp 
    distinction between learning (for the elite) and <B>education</B> (for the 
    masses). 
    <P>A neat summary of this principle was given in 1911, Meiji's next-to-last 
    year, when, in a squabble known as the Northern and Southern Dynasties 
    controversy, the legitimacy of the imperial line was thrown into question. 
    How should this issue be described in textbooks without weakening the 
    throne? Here is how a Todai scholar with an ideological bent reasoned: 
    <P>When doing research and making judgments . . . there are of course two 
    attitudes we can take. First, with regard to reality as reality, we must 
    conduct our inquiries in a scientific manner, without sticking to questions 
    of right or wrong, good or bad. In the other case we are obliged to pursue 
    our researches and make our judgments from the standpoint of the national 
    morality . . . in other words, what is good or bad for the state. It should 
    go without saying that in the case of our national textbooks, the principle 
    of selection is not to be found in the first of these attitudes. 
    <P>Knowledge as power: In modern Japan it would be one thing to arrive at 
    the truth, another to disseminate it. 
    <P>Fukuzawa detested this sort of logic. Mori, as we have noted, was more 
    ambivalent, but he had his own quarrels with the old Confucianists. He did 
    not want schools to teach either ideology or Shinto as an official religion. 
    In 1887, he tweaked conservatives in his resolution of a festering row over 
    ethics instruction. After the Meiji Restoration the first ethics texts had 
    been direct translations of American works. Confucianists gradually replaced 
    these during the 1880s with their own tracts on moral education. Unhappy 
    with the trend, Mori simply banned ethics texts of any kind. Already suspect 
    for the Western tint in his thinking, Mori as an enemy of the true soul of 
    Japan became an idée fixe among conservatives from this period onward. 
    <P>But here we come to one of Mori's intellectual swamps. What did he want 
    schools to teach? "It is a big mistake to think that the primary aims of 
    <B>education</B> should reside in instruction in the three 'R's," he said 
    the same year he banned the ethics texts. Mori wanted schools to produce 
    "virtuous subjects." What would those be like? Mori asked this question 
    himself and then answered it. "They will be imperial subjects who completely 
    fulfill their duties, which means that when called upon to do so they will 
    willingly give their lives to the state." 
    <P>He may have equivocated about the conservatives, and they about him, but 
    Mori handed them the schools they needed. Few decisions were left to local 
    discretion in the system structured during the late 1880s. Curricula, 
    textbooks, and standards became the business of the Mombusho, the 
    <B>Education</B> Ministry. Tokyo functionaries inspected every school in 
    Japan annually. Most private schools were shut down; to neutralize the rest 
    Mori decreed that only pupils from state schools could sit for university 
    exams. Then came the teachers, many of whom were liberals and populists who 
    could not be entrusted with the task of molding the modern Japanese. The 
    Rules of Behavior for Primary School Teachers banned instructors from 
    political discussions. Intent on turning teachers into reliable conduits of 
    kokutai, the national essence, Mori brought teacher training under Mombusho 
    control. Candidates had to wear military tunics. When the bureaucracy was 
    finished with them they were deployed around the country like soldiers. 
    <P>Mori's system endured until 1945. High among his influences were France 
    and Germany, the one for its central command, the other for a meritocratic 
    system in the service of an emerging industrial economy. But what was put 
    into the vessel Mori made was purely Japanese. 
    <P>In 1890, a year after Mori's death, the emperor issued one of the two or 
    three most important documents of the prewar era. It came amid great 
    confusion. Mori's murder had shaken the government -- not least because of 
    popular confusion as to whether the assassin had been right or wrong. What 
    kind of country had the oligarchy made? That was just the question addressed 
    in the Imperial Rescript on <B>Education</B>. Like every other communiqué 
    issued in the emperor's name, it was written not by the sovereign but by 
    those around him who ruled in his name. It reads today like a harmless set 
    of platitudes regarding the old Confucian virtues and "the fundamental 
    character of Our Empire." 
    <P>But the rescript's influence was immense, and extended far beyond Mori's 
    schools. Rescripts were national codes, instructions to all Japanese. There 
    is no paranoia in imagining behind the <B>education</B> rescript the roll of 
    military drums. In it loyalty and filial piety were officially combined once 
    more. To serve the emperor was to serve the state, and vice versa. This was 
    the new edifice within: precisely what Fukuzawa, albeit with his faulty 
    argument, had fought. 
    <P>Mori's schools required no great change to accommodate the rescript. At 
    the bottom there was universal <B>education</B>: Six years of compulsory 
    schooling by Meiji's end, when enrollment reached just under 100 percent. 
    Long before the years of military dictatorship -- before, even, Meiji was 
    over -- <B>education</B> was legally defined not as a child's right or as a 
    responsibility of parent to child, but as a parent's duty to the state. "The 
    entire nation," one might have declared, "is mobilized behind children and 
    their <B>education</B>." 
    <P>At the top were the universities, places of learning as opposed to 
    <B>education</B>. Only in the universities could ideas be explored in 
    anything resembling an open atmosphere. Even there impartial scholarship was 
    treated as a kind of radioactive experiment. There were seven imperial 
    universities and a few private ones. (In 1868 Fukuzawa had the forethought 
    to found one, Keio University, that is still put among Japan's best.) This 
    handful was enough. Japan needed an elite, but a small, manageable one. 
    Todai stood at the apex. In 1887 an imperial ordinance awarded Todai law 
    graduates the exclusive right to advance directly into upper ranks of the 
    bureaucracy -- a privilege still apparent. 
    <P>In shape the system resembled Meiji society: a pyramid with steep sides. 
    Schools became what they are today: battlegrounds, all the more gruesome 
    because the foot soldiers are so young. Mori's schools were the central 
    venue of what scholars call successism, or the ideology of striving -- that 
    fierce competition created by the release of desire and ambition in a 
    society that remained a hierarchy. While basic <B>education</B> was 
    universal, no more than 15 percent of students went on from there. 
    Schooling, no matter what it consisted of, no matter whose picture hung on 
    the wall, became a mania among people finally offered a path, however 
    narrow, upward. <B>education</B> madness first appeared in the 1890s. 
    Successism produced too many aspiring students -- too many commoners who saw 
    that school was the only way up from the rice paddies. The primary schools 
    were full, but they were not yet dependable; they did not turn out pu-pils 
    of uniform qualifications. There were too few schools beyond the primary 
    level anyway: The pyramid was too steep. Schools above the elementary level 
    became addicted, as they are now, to entrance examinations. 
    <P>Exam hell was bad enough at Meiji's end. A student's place in society, 
    the course of his entire adult life, was decided by a test. But it got even 
    worse after 1945. The occupation lit the fires of aspiration anew. Colleges 
    and universities mushroomed: There are now roughly five hundred of them. But 
    there could be five times that number and little will change so long as 
    schools, and not a student's achievements, are rated according to a 
    hierarchy strictly observed in both government and business. All that has 
    changed is the number of aspirants looking toward the top -- and the number 
    of disappointed failures consigned to universities of indifferent quality. 
    <P>Exam hell has produced numerous peculiarities. Japan is a society of 
    kyoiku mamas -- <B>education</B> mothers, obsessed with their children's 
    success. There are many thousands of high school graduates, called ronin 
    (after wandering samurai without masters), who failed the entrance exams and 
    wait to retake them. As everyone in Japan knows, most matriculated students 
    do little during their university years because their place in society is 
    more or less fixed no matter what they accomplish. The companies they join 
    will finish the task of turning them into shakai-jin, social beings. So 
    their university years are not an <B>education</B> so much as a reward for 
    surviving exam hell, a last fling at attenuated freedom. 
    <P>Cram schools, called juku, are another oddity. They are a parallel system 
    at least as important as the schools that award diplomas. Seventy percent of 
    primary and middle school students attend juku or (in some cases) have 
    private tutors; for high school students the figure is 80 percent. Juku are 
    big business. Fees run to many thousands of dollars a year. Japan is lauded 
    for the austerity of its educational budget: It is the lowest in the 
    industrial world. But Tokyo depends heavily on the private side of 
    <B>education</B>. In the average family, <B>education</B> consumes a quarter 
    of income; more than half of what it spends on preuniversity 
    <B>education</B> is taken up by juku fees and related expenses. 
    <P>The juku once met a practical need. They resembled the temple schools of 
    the Edo era, in which a scholar taught basic arithmetic and writing so that 
    the children of commoners, as adults, could manage local affairs. After the 
    war teachers minded the children of the millions of workers who drifted into 
    the cities, where there were no villagers to share the burden and no 
    grandparents in the household. But the juku have blown way off course. Not 
    only are they part of the national obsession; in a way they drive it by 
    feeding the anxieties of parents about the success of their children in 
    national exams. 
    <P>In Ikebukuro, a commercial district in northwestern Tokyo, there is a 
    cram school called Shingakai, the Growing Bud Club. It occupies half a floor 
    in a building called Sunshine 60 after the number of stories it has and 
    because its height, unusual in Tokyo's low-rise sprawl, puts its upper 
    floors far enough above the densest smog to allow them clear light. In 
    Shingakai's large, bare rooms students prepare for the exam system by taking 
    additional lessons -- the work of any juku. In theory, at least, Shingakai 
    graduates will have it over competitors in the race for places in the 
    nation's most favored schools. But then there are many other juku like 
    Shingakai -- between fifty thousand and sixty thousand, most of them in the 
    cities, where competition is fiercest. 
    <P>Shingakai is special in one sense. It was the first juku for a new age 
    group: one- and two-year-olds. No one I met there was quite sure when this 
    ground was broken, but it appears to have been sometime in the early 1980s. 
    This was a tragic but inevitable step -- and a measure of how acutely 
    competitive Japan had become beneath the harmony on the surface. During the 
    1980s kyoiku mamas began to talk of "<B>education</B> in the womb" -- an 
    expectant mother's recitation of numbers and words to give her fetuses a 
    head start. 
    <P>Shingakai's progress reflects the fraught path <B>education</B> has taken 
    since the war. It did not start out as a juku. It was founded in 1956 by a 
    man named Hideo Ohori, who studied psychology at university. It was like an 
    old temple school, except that Ohori-sensei was a pied piper more than a 
    Confucian scholar. He minded neighborhood children and got two or three 
    hundred yen a day for each. Then Shingakai began to offer preparatory 
    classes for exams to enter elementary schools: It became a juku. Now it has 
    thirteen branches in and around Tokyo. 
    <P>Tsutomu Matsuzawa, the general manager, looked more like an accomplished 
    sarariman than a sensei. He was tall and thin with neat, oiled hair, a dark 
    suit, and polished manners. He spent a good part of his day greeting 
    well-to-do <B>education</B> mothers eager to enroll their children. But 
    despite his practiced confidence, Matsuzawa grew hesitant when we began to 
    talk about something called mock testing. Yes, Shingakai ran mock tests, he 
    said, but it did not have the Spartan regime of other cram schools. "We 
    emphasize adequate growth for each pupil. The <B>education</B> we give is 
    through play." 
    <P>Mock tests began in the mid-1960s, when private testing companies started 
    to apply computer analysis to the tests they produced for schools. Mock 
    tests were intended as practice for the real thing -- the entrance exams. 
    But with computers the mock tests were used to give each school a "deviation 
    value" each year: The tests were graded once on a right-and-wrong basis, and 
    again to locate each student's place in the school's average. The student's 
    rating was then used to determine which school he could enter, in advance of 
    the actual entrance exams. 
    <P>Mock tests rank among the most powerful of the school system's 
    addictions. The deviation measure is a kind of condemnation -- of schools 
    and students alike. It is frequently used to send students to schools they 
    do not want to attend. Most educators believe this is one main reason 
    120,000 high school students drop out every year. Shingakai used the mock 
    tests to determine where its five-year-old graduates could go to 
    kindergarten. 
    <P>Matsuzawa and I were joined by Shingakai's president, a more professorial 
    fellow named Kigen Fujimoto. Fujimoto began his career at the other end of 
    the system, training university graduates as they became "social beings" and 
    actually learned things -- simple, practical things. Fujimoto worked with 
    graduates in training to represent their companies, and he was shocked by 
    what he found among his charges. 
    <P>"They were almost incapable even of a task as simple as a professional 
    telephone call," he recalled. "I had to ask, 'What are we doing with our 
    children?' One day I heard a lecture by Ohori-sensei, our founder. 'I feel 
    that parents concern themselves too much with their kids. They interfere too 
    much. Children should be left free. The job of a child is playing. It can't 
    be right to manage the play of children. It isn't the accumulation of 
    knowledge that is important but the accumulation of experience.' That was 
    the basic content of the lecture. I was greatly moved." 
    <P>I was moved, too. But when I asked Fujimoto why parents sent their 
    children to Shingakai, he sighed wearily. "To put the conclusion first, 
    because they want their children to enter the kindergarten or elementary 
    school of their choice. So this is basically preparation for entrance 
    exams." 
    <P>Like white-coated clinicians, we filed into a room to watch a class in 
    progress. On a gym mat, four teachers and ten toddlers engaged in "free 
    play," as Fujimoto put it. There were blocks, balls, flags, plastic kitchen 
    implements. A couple of education mothers stood nearby. Fujimoto said, "The 
    important things are whether a child can work within a group and whether the 
    child has enough confidence to work independently of the mother." 
    <P>Fujimoto paused as the children lined up for a game. "What we do is make 
    as many good memories as possible for the kids, and educate the parents. If 
    they don't understand what <B>education</B> is, the child suffers." 
    <P>Fujimoto was another idealist, another of the men and women who fill the 
    school system and who understand what <B>education</B> ought to be. Parents 
    understand, too -- unfailingly. But understanding does not matter. Not all 
    the free play their first sensei allows will keep the children on the gym 
    mat -- from affluent, ambitious families, the most privileged in Japan -- 
    from suffering. 
    <P>I watched the children match red and blue balls with red and blue flags. 
    They were well dressed, well behaved, and played by the rules. They were 
    close enough to touch but seemed to exist at a great distance. At that 
    moment they were more like experiments than children, the room not a room 
    but some sort of scientific incubator. 
    <P>It would have been easy to think of the children as the victims of those 
    who stood around them -- the teachers, the administrators, the 
    <B>education</B> mothers -- except that they were all victims. Teachers like 
    to think their classes are a refuge from the system; parents, that they have 
    chosen wisely for their children. But it is almost never like that in the 
    Japanese system. Schools are merely rungs on a ladder. Shingakai was the 
    first. 
    <P>I visited a high school on a crisp, clear Tokyo morning. It was late 
    February, end of term in Japan. I sat with four graduating seniors in a 
    classroom that would never again be theirs. They had all been to cram school 
    for many years. One had attended a cram school to get into a better cram 
    school. She told me about her routine. "I would leave the house at eight, 
    finish school at three, then go home. From six to nine I was at cram school. 
    I got home again at ten, and worked until one in the morning." She wanted to 
    go to a special high school, with a much higher deviation value than the one 
    where we sat, but she had failed the entrance exam. "For a long time after I 
    entered this school, I wanted to quit." 
    <P>Her name was Ai Ogawara. After a time Ai and her friends began to argue 
    among themselves. They reminded me that Japan has something in common with a 
    Swiss watch, or one of those toy machines through which a ball tumbles, 
    lifting a lever that activates an armature that sets off a rotary conveyor, 
    and so on. Because Japan is so intricately made, to alter one part of the 
    system means that you must alter them all. Otherwise, the machine will no 
    longer function. Its gears and spindles and all the rest will no longer 
    match. 
    <P>"I don't like the system," Ai said. "It's just tests. Tests are one day. 
    After that, you don't study at all." 
    <P>"People think entering university is a form of torture necessary to be 
    free," someone else said. "That's why I think the system is wrong. I don't 
    want to waste my time." 
    <P>"The system isn't wrong," the only boy of the group protested. "It's 
    natural for people to want to get into good universities to get a good 
    salary." 
    <P>"Why say the <B>education</B> system is wrong?" Ai asked. "What's wrong 
    is the social system." 
    <P>
    <P>"So we should change the social system," the boy said. 
    <P>"But if we want to change the social system," Ai replied, "first we have 
    to change the government." in 1960, just as Japan erupted into the anti-AMPO 
    protests and Tokyo declared its high-growth economic policy, the 
    <B>Education</B> Ministry gathered a committee of scholars and bureaucrats 
    to consider the future of <B>education</B>. The report it produced (after 
    five years of labor) had a somewhat sinister title, The Image of the Desired 
    Japanese. It was written as an advisory to high school teachers and 
    announced itself, in its preface, as "a map of virtues." In length The Image 
    of the Desired Japanese was not much more than an essay, but it was an 
    extraordinary document nonetheless -- among the most revealing of the 
    postwar period. It is a classic case of what the occupation's reverse course 
    meant to ordinary Japanese. And it is a perfect example of why, as Ai 
    Ogawara put it, improving Japanese <B>education</B> finally means improving 
    the Japanese government. 
    <P>The Japanese must be taught never to forget that they are Japanese before 
    they are "world persons," the report began. They must respect the emperor 
    and devote themselves to work, because "society exists for production." In 
    the bargain they must recognize their reliance upon "the state, the society, 
    and the household." 
    <P>Individual happiness and security greatly depend on the state. The way to 
    contribute to humanity is usually opened through the state. To love the 
    state truly is loyalty to the state. . . . 
    <P>In theme and sentiment Desired Japanese was a return to the prewar era, a 
    nostalgia piece. There is an implicit regret over the loss of nationalist 
    spirit after the defeat. The nation must revive that "delicate affection" 
    and "firm will" of which "the beautiful Japanese tradition" is made. "If we 
    can make this delicate affection deeper and wider, we can be the tough, 
    beautiful, magnanimous Japanese." 
    <P>This sort of language was standard fare before 1945. Until the surrender, 
    schools were (along with the military) the central channel for the diffusion 
    of state ideology. The <B>Education</B> Ministry, packed with 
    ultra-nationalists, was among Tokyo's shrillest bureaucracies. Teachers and 
    other advocates of educational freedom had been trying to crawl out from 
    under the ministry's control since the 1920s. Instead, instruction was 
    reduced to nothing more than brainwashing. 
    <P>In other circumstances -- or if Japan had had a different modern history 
    -- it would be shocking to read invocations of "the beautiful Japanese 
    tradition" that date to the mid-1960s. Shocking, not least, because the men 
    who wrote Desired Japanese were managers of the system we are now encouraged 
    to admire. But <B>education</B> turned out to be a tragic casualty of the 
    reverse course. So Desired Japanese is not really much of a surprise at all. 
    G.H.Q. was not even closed before the prewar nationalists reassumed control 
    of the system, clawing back almost all of what they had lost to the early 
    changes. 
    <P>The occupation's reforms in <B>education</B> were sweeping and swift. 
    Authority devolved to communities and schools. The <B>Education</B> 
    Ministry, though far from cleaned out, was stripped of all but arm's-length 
    oversight powers; even its right to certify textbooks was limited. The 
    prewar system, which streamed roughly 15 percent of students beyond primary 
    grades, was replaced with a single stream called "6-3-3-4," which opened the 
    system from primary school through university to everyone. <B>Education</B> 
    became not a parent's obligation to the state but a child's right. So 
    declared the Fundamental Law on <B>Education</B>, written to replace the 
    imperial rescript. The Fundamental Law was instantly sacrosanct among the 
    Japanese. The Japan Teachers Union, which sprang up immediately after the 
    surrender and became Japan's largest union, was a powerful voice in support 
    of it. 
    <P>But the reforms were doomed from the start. The Fundamental Law was 
    passed in 1947, just as things began to change at G.H.Q. And the occupation 
    appointed the <B>Education</B> Ministry to implement it. The prewar elite 
    took to calling the early educational reforms "excesses of democratization," 
    a common phrase as the 1940s turned into the 1950s. In 1951 the 
    <B>education</B> minister, a survivor from the dictatorship named Teiyu 
    Amano, drafted "An Outline for National Moral Practice" and remarked in it: 
    <P>Nowadays, as a result of too much emphasis on the "individual" and the 
    "world at large," there has arisen a marked tendency to weaken the ground of 
    the state's existence. . . . The state is the womb of our existence, the 
    ethical and cultural core of our collective lives and activities. Therefore, 
    the very life of the nation depends on those activities which the individual 
    willingly performs so as to contribute to the well-being of the state. 
    <P>Amano's tract was tossed out of the Diet and popularly denigrated as 
    "Amano's imperial rescript." But it set the tone well. The reverse course in 
    <B>education</B> was completed in only a few years. The Japan Teachers Union 
    was disemboweled. Legislation passed in 1954 declared the ministry the 
    defender of educational freedom -- so handing the nightstick to the 
    convicted felon. When the ministry tried to reassert its authority over 
    textbooks, riots nearly erupted in the Diet. But the ministry did regain 
    control over local administration; most significant, it abolished school 
    boards chosen by election and assumed the power to appoint them. Skipping 
    the legislative process, the ministry revised curriculum guidelines and then 
    made them legally binding, turning teachers who deviated into criminals. 
    <P>This was enough to neutralize the Fundamental Law. The ministry's power 
    was soon sufficient to control areas, such as textbooks, where it had failed 
    legislatively. It was a neat trick, familiar enough in Japan: Maintain the 
    omote, the front, while discarding the ura within. The Fundamental Law 
    remained in place -- as it still does, a shining badge of democratic 
    <B>education</B>. But everything behind it had been altered. 
    <P>The Image of the Desired Japanese was a declaration of victory in this 
    postwar war: victory over the Fundamental Law, victory over liberal 
    <B>education</B>. It was never submitted to the Diet: Its authors feared the 
    reaction it would have provoked. But legislative approval was beside the 
    point. Desired Japanese became the "guiding ideal," in its chief author's 
    words, of the postwar school system. It called for nothing more or less than 
    a reassertion of the nihonjin, the Japanese person, in his official version. 

    <P>The oblique title raises an essential question. The desired Japanese: 
    Desired by whom? To answer this is to understand much about the postwar 
    system. Desired Japanese was not the work of brooding bureaucrats still 
    nursing the sting of defeat -- not entirely, anyway. Among its enthusiasts 
    was Keidanren, the Federation of Economic Organizations, Japan's most 
    powerful industrial group. Desired Japanese was intended chiefly to produce 
    the kind of human being Japan required as it embarked upon its high-growth 
    course. As Arinori Mori would have put it, it was intended to turn teachers 
    back into manufacturers. 
    <P>"While there is no one who cannot read or write due to nine years of 
    compulsory <B>education</B>, the system is preventing the growth of free, 
    individual personalities." 
    <P>This appraisal of Japanese schools is notable only for who delivered it: 
    Kunio Hatoyama, a career bureaucrat serving, in the summer of 1992, as 
    <B>education</B> minister. Why, after more than a century of 
    <B>education</B> wars, would the general in command of the castle take the 
    position of the insurgents? 
    <P><B>Education</B> was a heated issue by the time Hatoyama spoke. No one 
    (except foreigners, perhaps) could any longer pretend that discontent within 
    the system -- among teachers, students, and parents -- was anything less 
    than universal. Here are a few headlines from the first half of the 1990s: 
    stress person, not test, <B>education</B> minister says individualizing 
    <B>education</B> all young japanese are not the same mock exams mock system 
    too much central control for less conformity in <B>education</B> 
    <P>All but the first of these phrases introduced editorials in national 
    newspapers. To read them in the organs that shape officially approved views 
    would have been unthinkable for most of the postwar era. Yet the headlines 
    alone reveal the key notions at stake in the eternal battles over 
    <B>education</B>: diversity, liberalization, individuation, choice, 
    creativity, initiative. 
    <P>These were supposedly the new values of the <B>education</B> ministry. 
    When Hatoyama spoke, and when the commentaries were written, Tokyo said it 
    was preparing to make Japanese schools what people wanted them to be. Such a 
    thing was to be no minor adjustment. Ministry bureaucrats called it "the 
    third educational reform." The preceding two were those of the Meiji era and 
    the postwar years. 
    <P>But it is important to understand what officials mean, for it would be a 
    mistake to accept their remarks at face value. It is more accurate to view 
    the third <B>education</B> reform as another effort to shape a "desired 
    Japanese." The only difference between the desired Japanese of the 1960s and 
    the 1990s version lay in the kind of Japanese considered desirable. 
    <P>Japan began to think differently of its future after the first abrupt 
    rise in oil prices, in 1973. The high growth achieved over the previous two 
    decades was unlikely to be repeated. The leading intellects in the business 
    community, men such as Konosuke Matsushita, founder of the electronics giant 
    that bears his name, envisioned a Japan less reliant upon the protective 
    barriers to competition, erected from Meiji onward and tolerated by 
    Washington during the years of reconstruction and Cold War tension. This 
    elaborate complex would eventually have to come down. Japan would have to 
    become genuinely competitive. In the 1980s a pair of neat phrases gained 
    currency: Industry had been oriented toward ju ko cho dai, heavy, thick, 
    long, and big. In the future it would be kei haku tan sho, light, thin, 
    short, and small. Japan could no longer mass-produce or copy and modify 
    products conceived and designed elsewhere. It would have to develop its own 
    advanced technologies, and it would have to be quicker on its feet in the 
    information and services industries. 
    <P>Yasuhiro Nakasone, who became premier in 1982, well understood these 
    imperatives. The economic preeminence he wanted for Japan meant more 
    influence and responsibility in the world community. There would be more 
    Japanese living and working abroad, and more gaijin in Japan. Above all, 
    Japan needed a new kind of person in the era of high technology. A mass 
    production economy required a few generals at the top and a vast army of 
    foot soldiers to serve loyally in the war for raw economic power, simple 
    girth. Preeminence would be another matter. Blue chip Japan would need 
    imaginative graduates with a capacity for original thinking. It would need, 
    in short, a new class of commissioned officers. 
    <P>In 1984 Nakasone named an "extraordinary council on <B>education</B>." In 
    its first report to the premier it wrote of "a state of desolation" in 
    Japanese schools. Violence, truancy, exam anxiety, the mushrooming growth of 
    juku -- all were recognized as symptoms of a vast malfunction. What was 
    Nakasone's answer? More moral <B>education</B> and more teacher training. 
    Classes were to honor the hinomaru flag, the rising sun, and sing the 
    Kimigayo anthem, although neither is constitutionally recognized. Textbook 
    screening, the source of much dispute, would be "streamlined": A book was 
    either accepted or rejected, and the author had no recourse (and would not 
    know the reasons behind the judgment anyway). 
    <P>And here we come to one of the great contradictions of Japan in the late 
    twentieth century. The school system would have to produce individuals, but 
    not people who lost sight of their duties to the state, the beautiful 
    traditions, the official idea of Japaneseness, and so on. But how can the 
    nation social-engineer free-thinking, experimentally inclined individuals in 
    the same way that it has turned out loyal samurai, soldiers and sailors, 
    sararimen, and factory workers in the past? Nakasone displayed his own 
    version of this contradiction: He was a dedicated privatizer in the fashion 
    of the times, but he favored rigorous state control over schools. 
    <P>Nakasone left office in 1987. Afterward one heard many answers to this 
    conundrum: more diversity and choice; less emphasis on exams and more on a 
    human environment. Overregulation, uniformity, and rote instruction would 
    have to go. In a less competitive system time must be made for personality 
    formation: sports, leisure activities. Local school boards must be revived. 
    The reforms must be bottom-up, not top-down. Little of this has actually 
    happened, though the third-reform idea is now in its third decade. None of 
    it answers the central question anyway. The people who supplied these 
    responses, senior bureaucrats at the <B>education</B> ministry, began to 
    remind me of Arinori Mori and his muddled thinking. Their answers were 
    merely the opening lines in a drama that will end in the next century. By 
    its own admission, the ministry was feeling its way, trying one thing, then 
    another -- much as the first modern educators did. 
    <P>An hour and a half by train west of Tokyo there is a new university, 
    called Tsukuba. Tsukuba was intended to be a sort of Japanese M.I.T. -- 
    strong on original research and the sciences, home of high-technology 
    breakthroughs, the sort of institution Japan needed to enter its next 
    economic phase. Yet it has failed to earn the comparison, chiefly because of 
    the caliber of students the system sends to Tsukuba's classrooms and 
    laboratories. Tsukuba has no intellectual charge, no electricity -- an 
    absence as palpable when one strolls the campus as its ungiving 
    architecture. 
    <P>Tsukuba's president was named Leo Esaki. Esaki was a Nobel laureate in 
    physics and a former research star at IBM. He had lived in America for 
    twenty-five years. He peppered his writings with mentions of Socrates, 
    Aquinas, Rousseau, John Dewey. In his energetic conversations, 
    "independence" and "individuality" were his bywords. He was pleased with 
    Japanese students, Esaki insisted when I went to see him. "But we want to 
    produce peaks in the graph. In America you find people working at cash 
    registers who can't even add. Yet America has more than a hundred and fifty 
    Nobel laureates in science. Here the average person is very capable by 
    comparison. But we have five science Nobels. That's thirty to one." 
    <P>Esaki paused for a moment. I asked him what would happen to Japan if 
    schools began to graduate classes of individuals. How would such people fit 
    into the machine -- the corporations, the bureaucracy, even the 
    universities? 
    <P>"Right now, about forty percent of high school students enter university. 
    I don't think we can educate all of those people to be individual 
    intellectuals. We're talking about a select group. You choose the most 
    talented people. Selection is inevitable." 
    <P>Esaki paused again. I asked if he were talking about creating a new 
    elite, and he seemed pleased that I had used the word. 
    <P>"That's basically it -- an elite of about ten percent. Every society has 
    an elite. There are leaders and followers. The Japanese system is already 
    equipped to produce followers." 
    <P>"But elites are not something you can plan," I suggested. "If you set out 
    to create a new elite, can its members be very different from one another? 
    They will all take the side of the power that selected them. What makes an 
    elite acceptable is its diversity." 
    <P>None of this seemed to matter to Esaki. He was known as the leading 
    spokesman for the third reform in <B>education</B>. He offered me a glimpse 
    of the schools of the future -- or at least the future schools as those who 
    ran them saw it. Yet he did not describe the future at all, but the past. In 
    perfectly contemporary terms he spoke not of a new system, or even a 
    reformed system, but the old imperial system, in which <B>education</B> and 
    learning were two separate things and where there was no question of 
    anything being bottom-up. In Esaki's universe, knowledge would again be 
    power. 
    <P>"It's relatively simple in the field of science," Esaki persisted. "We 
    need a better way to select people. Then there's mass <B>education</B>. But 
    I'm more interested in elite <B>education</B> -- you know, scholarship." it 
    is impossible to share the enthusiasms of Leo Esaki, or the gaijin admirers 
    of Japanese schools, when reform means sustaining discriminatory and 
    coercive practices invented by a nineteenth-century oligarchy, perfected by 
    a dictatorship, and then, five decades ago, at least briefly outlawed. 
    <P>But <B>education</B> is unlikely to arrive in Leo Esaki's idea of the 
    future. It is no longer possible to control knowledge, for one thing. For 
    another, there is too much energy at the bottom. The school system is like a 
    jack-in-the-box, still unsprung. Much of this energy is negative -- sullen 
    and deformed. Yet on a journey through the system one also stumbles upon its 
    rare treasures. There behind the facade of uniformity they suggest that, 
    however long it takes, the Japanese will learn that they are individuals 
    before they are Japanese, and that no method will ever be found to change 
    this fact. 
    <P>An hour from Tokyo by commuter train there is a school called Jiyu no 
    Mori, the Freedom Forest School, so named for the dense pines surrounding 
    it. I went there one late-winter afternoon, just as classes ended. It would 
    be difficult to exaggerate the strangeness of the scene. When I opened the 
    front door against the wind I was greeted by a cacophony of shouts, musical 
    instruments, running footsteps, clanging lockers, slamming doors, and voices 
    -- singing voices, laughing voices, voices in many different conversations. 
    As I talked with the principal, a flautist practiced solos in the next room. 
    Yutaka Endoh, a thin, overworked man in a modest suit, seemed not to notice 
    any of it. 
    <P>"Our aim is to raise young people to be human beings, not just Japanese," 
    Endoh began. "We're developing thought and intellect, emotional lives, and 
    the will by which one directs the mind and body toward an ideal -- a goal, a 
    target. A student should have discovered himself by the time he graduates, 
    and have an independent will to be free." 
    <P>Endoh stopped to gauge my response before adding, "All this is natural if 
    <B>education</B> regards humanity as important. But these are unusual goals 
    in the Japanese social context." 
    <P>Outside Endoh's window, something between rain and snow had begun to fall 
    on the thick pine forest. It suggested a kind of tough winter idyll. An hour 
    away were Tokyo and the examination halls through which Jiyu no Mori's 
    students would have to pass if they were to continue on to university. For a 
    moment it seemed an act of cruelty to prepare people for a world they would 
    not find, and I explained this thought to Endoh. 
    <P>"Let me give you a few figures," he replied. "We graduate two hundred and 
    forty students from high school each year. Fifty or sixty go straight to 
    university, twenty or thirty to junior colleges. Seventy take a year to 
    prepare for entrance exams, and another seventy go to technical schools. 
    Twenty find jobs right away." 
    <P>"But how do they compete?" 
    <P>"If you have a root you can grow branches. If you give students 
    fundamental knowledge, they should have no difficulty preparing for exams -- 
    and with less effort than otherwise." 
    <P>Endoh was in his sixties -- of the generation too young to have gone to 
    war but old enough to remember it. There are many Japanese his age like him: 
    People who made the rest of their lives a kind of atonement for their 
    failure to act against the dictatorship, the war, and the "black box" of 
    ideology. After the defeat Endoh taught for twenty years in a progressive 
    private school in Tokyo until he decided that, despite its intentions, the 
    school (like so many others) could not resist turning students into devices 
    made only to take exams. 
    <P>Endoh started Jiyu no Mori in the early 1980s after raising 4 billion 
    yen, about $40 million. Half of that was still debt, but it brought the 
    school across the great barrier to alternative <B>education</B>: Without 4 
    billion yen of their own, private schools do not qualify for government 
    subsidies. Now Jiyu no Mori had twelve hundred students, from junior high 
    school through twelfth grade. "We're trying to give students wisdom," Endoh 
    said after explaining the numbers, "the thing needed to assess the state of 
    society and then to influence it." 
    <P>Endoh's deputy, many years his junior, appeared at the door: It was late, 
    and he wanted me to see the tenth-grade choir practicing for a recital to be 
    held at the local town hall in two days' time. 
    <P>The walk from Endoh's office to the gymnasium door, where the choir was 
    assembled, was a passage through controlled chaos. A student greeted us by 
    throwing a basketball into the deputy's arms. Another assailed him with a 
    martial arts kick that came within inches of his face. Endoh's deputy smiled 
    and tried not to lose the thread of our conversation. At the gym door he 
    said good-bye and disappeared into a flock of students. 
    <P>I began to wonder whether Jiyu no Mori was a kind of pointless 
    overstatement -- a purposeful anarchy created in reaction to the rigidities 
    of the system, but nothing that would bear upon the future. 
    <P>In the gymnasium the choir was between pieces and debating which to do 
    next. The walls were smudged. Piles of loose books lay along the sides of 
    the room. Bright colors were everywhere; no one wore a uniform. 
    <P>Then, suddenly, they began to sing, a choir of about fifty behind an 
    orchestra of maybe half that number. Without warning they swelled into parts 
    of Mozart's Requiem and Vivaldi's Gloria. Then the Agnus Dei. I had to turn 
    my face away. All the disorder had vanished. An extraordinary unison took 
    its place, filling the room until the windows seemed about to burst against 
    the rain and snow outside. 
    <P>I waited to meet these students, the most exultant Japanese I have ever 
    known.

    <UL>. . . one feels as though one's soul has found for itself a strange 
      home.<BR>-- Soseki Natsume Kokoro, 1914</UL>
    <P>In my last year in Tokyo I moved from a gaijin flat to a central but 
    unrestored quarter of the city. The local fudo-san, the rental agent, was 
    called Shiino and shared the business with his father. The Shiino's operated 
    from a room crammed with desks, chairs, filing cabinets, fax machines, 
    telephones, portable heaters, and a tiny coffee table covered with a plastic 
    doily, over which business was done. The room measured six tatami, a 
    standard size, about the dimensions of a large Western bathroom. The front 
    window was plastered with scribbled sheets advertising available apartments. 

    <P>There was one for eighty-five thousand yen, about $700 at the time, on a 
    lane in Minami Aoyama. It would be primitive, but it was less than I was 
    prepared to spend, and I had a friend nearby. 
    <P>"No," said Shiino the younger, a reedy, uncertain fellow in his forties. 
    "You wouldn't like that one. What about -- " 
    <P>"But I like the sound of this place," I said. 
    <P>"It's really quite dirty," Shiino replied. He frowned, shook his head, 
    and drew on a cigarette. 
    <P>"That can be fixed. Why don't we have a look anyway?" 
    <P>"Sumisu-san, it's just not your kind of place. Very dark. Full of smells. 
    It's not for you." 
    <P>I was about to persist when Shiino the elder grew impatient. He was small 
    and easygoing. In his seventies, he was of the generation that had fought 
    the war. He wore an old suit of the same blanched gray as his stubbly crew 
    cut. He lived in a tiny place upstairs; with a broom of bound twigs, he 
    swept the street in front of the office just after dawn every morning. 
    <P>"It's not for gaijin," the old man barked, half to me, half to his son. 
    "The owner lives next door. He would never have a gaijin in that apartment." 
    Then the old man smiled. 
    <P>I finally found a drafty, weathered house -- "They've had gaijin 
    gentlemen before," the younger Shiino assured me on the way over -- within 
    the much-reduced estate of an old Tokyo family named Yamada. It was in a 
    quiet cul-de-sac of a dozen dwellings. Hard by one another, these were 
    miracles of folk engineering. I had no view of my neighbors, and they none 
    of me, so long as we kept our paper screens and wooden doors closed. Open 
    any one, and everything that had been private the previous minute was 
    public. 
    <P>An ugly canopy of corrugated plastic blocked sunlight into the kitchen, 
    the only room that faced the street. It was like an old reed screen, hiding 
    me from others and limiting my view to a few television antennae and a 
    sliver of sky. One day I asked Mrs. Yamada if I could remove it. 
    <P>"That's impossible," she replied without her usual grace. 
    <P>I told her I did not mind the neighbors seeing through the window. "It's 
    only the kitchen, after all." 
    <P>"It's not the neighbors seeing in," she said. "It's you seeing out. It 
    would upset all the other households." 
    <P>My neighbors were the middle-class families of sararimen. Their curiosity 
    subsided only after I went around at dusk one Saturday to introduce myself 
    to each. (I was advised that I could skip the customary bowl of hot noodles 
    newcomers are expected to offer.) I remained a novelty. But I was gradually 
    accepted as part of the Yamada ie, and through the Yamadas as part of the 
    village known by the address all the houses shared, Nishi-Azabu 2-chome. 
    <P>It was a narrow lane where idiosyncracies were tolerated, but only after 
    the required process of establishing them. Someone played the harmonica in 
    the evenings. Another house had a superb collection of jazz recordings. 
    Someone returned from work on a bicycle with a loose fender and screeching 
    brakes at precisely one-thirty each morning. A neighbor's dog barked all day 
    Sunday (and for some reason only Sunday). All of this was fine. But I was 
    not to hang laundry from my upstairs balcony: It dripped onto a neighbor's 
    tin roof. And that, because it had never happened before, was a 
    transgression. 
    <P>In the autumn a man drove by before dusk in a tiny open truck with, 
    improbably enough, an open fire in the back. Over it sweet potatoes roasted 
    in the traditional way, amid hot rocks of luminous gray. Through a crackling 
    microphone the man droned the old poetry of the village:
    <P>
    <UL>Baked sweet potatoes,<BR>Baked on heated stones,<BR>Just baked, sweet 
      and tasty,<BR>Can't I tempt you?<BR>Baked sweet potatoes . . . </UL>
    <P>Two blocks away were the boutiques of Moschino and Jean-Charles de 
    Castelbajac, and beyond them a postmodern wonder done in raw concrete by the 
    architect Tadao Ando. Just up the street was an elegant restaurant called 
    Kihachi, run by a refined man partial to double-breasted suits and Issey 
    Miyake shirts -- a modern-day "high collar," in Meiji era parlance. He had 
    gone to France and returned to combine his acquired knowledge with local 
    custom in the kitchen. 
    <P>At the Meiji Restoration Japan was a country of roughly 30 million 
    people. Eighty percent of them were peasants eager to become the first 
    people known as "Japanese." Edo's population at the moment it became Tokyo 
    was less than a million. Then it began to grow: to more than 2 million at 
    the end of the Meiji period, to almost 4 million by 1920, year of the first 
    modern census. In August of 1945, half of the city's 7 million inhabitants 
    were either dead or dispersed in the countryside. Then Tokyo began to grow 
    once more: It reached 7 million again by 1952, and 10 million a decade 
    later. In the 1960s an average of more than a hundred families a day left 
    the old villages for Tokyo and the other cities along the Pacific coast. 
    Today Tokyo is the world's largest metropolitan area; 40 million people live 
    and work within twenty miles of the center. 
    <P>Modernization made Tokyo a city of dislocated souls. With the restoration 
    in 1868, the new "Eastern Capital" became the powerful center Japan never 
    previously had, a magnet whose field was all of the islands. Even the 
    emperor was an immigrant. In Tokyo, samurai formality combined with the 
    novelty of Western things to create something odd for the common Japanese: 
    distance, unfamiliarity, urban anxiety. And at bottom the detachment of the 
    new city dwellers was a detachment from themselves, for they had turned 
    themselves into "others." 
    <P>From the plain surrounding Tokyo, called Kanto, southwestward to another 
    plain surrounding Osaka and Kyoto, called Kansai, is a slim corridor known 
    as omote nihon, the front of Japan. And after a century and a quarter of 
    furious modernization, it is still what we mean when we talk about Japan and 
    the Japanese. It is the showplace of the postwar "miracle." Two-thirds of 
    the Japanese population live in this space, which accounts for 14 percent of 
    the islands. Three-quarters of the nation's industrial output comes from 
    there, which makes the strip of land at the front edge of the country 
    roughly half again the size of Germany in economic terms. It is home to 
    almost all the nation's banks, insurance houses, financial markets, 
    corporate headquarters, publishers, universities, media, and manufacturing 
    plants. Those few large enterprises with head offices elsewhere (Matsuda, 
    which makes Mazda cars; Komatsu, the builder of construction equipment) keep 
    considerable presences in Tokyo to be near the bureaucratic center of power. 

    <P>There are other cities like Tokyo. A great many Parisians arrive in Paris 
    from distant departments only to make their names or fortunes before 
    returning to towns they never really left behind, or to their maisons 
    secondaires someplace else. Paris, like Tokyo, is an overgrown village. But 
    the comparison stops there. The French never became strangers to themselves 
    when they went to Paris. Many generations of Japanese who went to Tokyo did. 

    <P>The modern era gave the Japanese capital, like other cities along the 
    Pacific coast, two distinct faces, or -- better put -- a revealed face and 
    hidden interior. Tokyo became a city full of references to other places: to 
    the West (French restaurants, dance halls, Victorian brick facades) and to 
    the village (rustic wooden houses, backyard rice paddies). One went to Tokyo 
    to participate in the new Japan -- to work for a large, new enterprise. 
    Cutting his topknot and donning a frock coat, the new urban dweller became a 
    "high collar." But he also retreated from the modern city, the Tokyo meant 
    to be seen, to the Tokyo within. Today Tokyo is a city of noisy restaurants 
    and skyscrapers full of bars, broad thoroughfares, office buildings, 
    ministries, and stylish shops. But a few steps from any major intersection 
    the avenues still give way to a warren of barely passable lanes, where in 
    the evenings men walk about in pyjamas and slippers. A friend who lived a 
    block from Roppongi crossing, among the world's busiest and most neoned 
    junctions, used to awaken every morning to the crowing of several roosters. 
    <P>"'Even in the town you will find the countryside,'" noted Kurt Singer in 
    Mirror, Sword and Jewel: The Geometry of Japanese Life. Singer's brief book, 
    written in 1946, remains among the most insightful a gaijin has ever written 
    on Japan, and one can easily see what he meant. But the old Japanese saying 
    he quoted to describe the city is no longer as true as it must have been 
    then. Today Tokyoites are no longer strangers to themselves, no longer at 
    odds with what they used to be. The past of most Tokyoites is now in Tokyo: 
    a simple demographic fact. And so the city no longer defines itself by 
    either the Japanese past or the West it used to imitate. Tokyo is becoming 
    simply Tokyo -- neither a display case nor a city nostalgic for the village. 
    And in the same way the modern Japanese are beginning to accept that they 
    are the Japanese as they really are -- crowded together in apartment 
    buildings and offices, rather different from one another after all, with 
    none of the sameness of villagers and no mud on their shoes. 
    <P>In the 1980s a writer named Hikari Agata published a story titled "A 
    Family Party." It is about a mother and her children whose neighborhood has 
    been redeveloped. An eighteen-story hotel stands on the family plot. Urban 
    rootlessness beckons. "This neighborhood had always given the impression of 
    being disorderly," the narrator says, and yet, I was always relieved 
    whenever I returned to it from the jungle of high-rise buildings. It had 
    been a neighborhood where browns and grays melted nicely together, and the 
    natural colors were gentle on my skin. 
    <P>Tokyoites will sometimes still reveal this lingering attachment to their 
    ura-dori, their backstreets. The uncomfortable old houses, the more 
    weatherworn the better, have given refuge as much as physical shelter. At 
    the same time, the wrecking ball provides one of the great urban dramas of 
    the modern era. It is common to see entire neighborhoods transformed within 
    weeks. In place of village houses come houses in a thousand contemporary 
    styles. In place of wood in tones of brown and gray come raw concrete and 
    charcoal-shaded granite, the postmodern materials much favored by Japanese 
    architects. 
    <P>When I lived in Tokyo the change provided some small, tactile sense of 
    the unnerving speed of Japan's modernization. I could go away for a week and 
    return to find a house down the block demolished, gone, and something 
    entirely different already half built in its place. The scene repeated 
    itself again and again -- an urban renewal that also extended to the way the 
    Japanese live and work in their cities. "we live unfree lives, shoulder 
    unnatural burdens, and suffer under an irrational system," a Tokyo shipyard 
    worker wrote in a union magazine in 1922. "Where is our value as humans? 
    Racing to the factory on icy mornings, rushing home under the stars, we have 
    no chance to enjoy life. We live an inhuman existence." 
    <P>It is remarkable how early and often the theme of humanity denied appears 
    in the accounts of the modern Japanese. Unnatural burdens, an irrational 
    system: It is as if Japan's first modern generations understood immediately 
    that something strangely irregular, even aberrant, lay at the core of their 
    transformation into "the Japanese." The primal experience of the modern, 
    shared by millions of migrants to the cities, was one of departure. Had they 
    somehow lost themselves and their humanity when they left the village behind 
    to become the samurai of the future? 
    <P>In Kokoro, his 1914 novel, Soseki Natsume gives us a poignant picture of 
    the early, aspiring sarariman through a character he calls simply K. K has 
    left his village for Tokyo, where he throws himself into his pursuit of "the 
    true way," though he knows not what the true way is. He cultivates an 
    unbending will. Seeking "concentration of mind," he drives himself to the 
    brink of exhaustion. He devotes himself to "modern concepts" yet is equally 
    given to honoring heroic figures of the past, self-flagellating samurai who 
    disdained all comforts and embraced all hardships for the sake of the do, 
    the way, of virtue and masculine reverence. 
    <P>Soseki was prophetic, for we recognize this man: In our own time he would 
    aspire to a standard blue suit and a standard white shirt and a middling 
    position at Toyota or Toshiba -- section manager, assistant department 
    manager, or some other precisely defined rank. Because the line between the 
    public and private is drawn in so peculiar a place, we see in him also the 
    odd intersection of economics and psychology that is unique, perhaps, to 
    modern Japan. Soseki's character sacrifices everything to make himself a 
    firm, resolute Japanese according to a tradition he finds elusive even as it 
    consumes him. But in his endeavor he becomes, in the narrator's word, 
    inhuman. "Set up fences in your hearts against wandering or extravagant 
    thoughts," a samurai house law advised many centuries ago. That is to say, 
    fences against ordinary thoughts. So we recognize this about the modern 
    Japanese warrior, too. There is something inhuman in the ideal to which he 
    is supposed to dedicate himself. 
    <P>I once went to an office building in Tokyo to meet a man named Terutaka 
    Kawabata, who was descended from a family of samurai. Kawabata was thin and 
    graying, a business executive somewhere in his late fifties, but he had a 
    kinetic vitality that made him seem much younger. Kawabata was dressed in 
    the pyjamalike trousers and abbreviated kimono of the warrior. We were in a 
    large basement room with a wooden floor, like a ballet studio. There we 
    watched his Wednesday evening class in yaido, an early form of kendo, "way 
    of the sword." 
    <P>As we talked and drank green tea, a half dozen middle-aged men dressed in 
    identical costumes practiced the fixed movements of which yaido is made. 
    Each one traced meticulous replications of the old choreography. It was as 
    if they called upon memories embedded in their arms and legs. Each face -- 
    lips tightened, eyes half-closed -- was a blank. But for the crack of swords 
    together, or the occasional thump of a bare foot on the wooden floor, the 
    room was dead silent. "The object is to move in a perfect and beautiful 
    way," Kawabata whispered. "You must learn it. You can't innovate." 
    <P>Kawabata was not a hobbyist. His lessons were meant for life outside the 
    windowless room where we sat. "I use the same tactics in business and with 
    friends as I use in yaido. I'm always ready to react. The Japanese like to 
    protect themselves from changes in life. But it's important to learn the 
    techniques." He continued in this vein until his students finished. They 
    were from companies whose names I recognized easily. It was odd to see 
    chemical salesmen, shipping executives, and securities traders paired off to 
    duel with wooden swords. But here was Soseki's K, eighty years on and 
    gainfully employed, the corporate warrior who was supposed to approach his 
    paperwork or his sales quota with precisely the determination of the samurai 
    who once roamed Japan with the purest of motives, the clearest of minds, and 
    concentration willed from within. 
    <P>Except that Kawabata's students did not possess these qualities. There 
    was about them a certain timidity, an absence of clarity and purpose all the 
    more evident for finding itself in the same room with Kawabata's vitality 
    and focus. In a word, Kawabata's charges were altogether ordinary. And what 
    did these men really want to learn from their yaido master? Ancient gestures 
    across the air, or how to be alive, to feel passion for the task -- to be 
    good Japanese according to rules that required them, like K and like 
    Kawabata, to squeeze the ordinariness out of themselves? 
    <P>At the foot of Mount Fuji there is a place called the Management Training 
    Institute. It looks like a boot camp -- more or less what it is. There are 
    drill fields, flagpoles, a few radio towers, and two long, low barracks that 
    form an L. The Management Training Institute is for fallen warriors, whose 
    companies are unhappy with their marketing results, or their production 
    schedules, or simply their attitudes. They are up at six and quit at 
    nine-thirty in the evening. There are night marches of twenty-five miles, 
    and shorter, faster ones of fifteen or so. Trainees call the institute "hell 
    camp" and their tours there "walking the floor of hell." 
    <P>Yasuo Motohashi, the president, was a deliberate man with silver hair. He 
    was interesting in his views of sararimen. "In a single word, the training 
    is to make people discover their spirit -- the spirit to work hard. It is 
    difficult for the sarariman to do things with sincerity and passion. We go 
    quite deep into our trainees. And this is the larger point: We find that 
    people are not in touch with themselves. They act only because they are 
    obliged to act. We want our trainees to realize how dull their lives have 
    been, how empty of true feeling." 
    <P>Living in Japan, one sees sararimen every day in Tokyo, Osaka, Kobe, and 
    other industrial cities along the Pacific coast. And you find everywhere the 
    same struggle to cross the yawning chasm between the ideal and the real -- 
    the same detachment from the great national task of economic production, the 
    same groping for some source of motivation. Isn't such detachment endemic in 
    the industrial world? It is, but only in Japan, where the public and private 
    have been so closely woven, has the idea persisted that the properly 
    conditioned psyche is essential not only to national economic success but to 
    existence in "the front of Japan." One is still supposed to strive out of 
    the same inner conviction that drove the samurai. But there are few 
    sararimen with the zest and passion of a swordsman such as Terutaka 
    Kawabata. So the absence of proper motivation comes to be looked upon as a 
    national pathology. 
    <P>One despairs of explaining this to foreigners who take the sarariman 
    ideal to be the authentic thing. The unstoppable corporate warrior is a 
    central ornament in our imaginary "Japan." It is a pernicious image in that 
    it makes the Japanese, to use Soseki's word, inhuman -- and therefore 
    fearsome. The reality is rather different, as the shipyard worker 
    understood, and as ordinary productivity comparisons between Japanese and, 
    say, American workers invariably reveal. There is nothing heroic in the 
    sarariman's unending slog. When the psychiatrist Masao Miyamoto remarked 
    upon the inefficiency he found in the Health Ministry, the director general 
    replied with an excellent description of the system as it really is: "It is 
    the accumulation of inefficiency that leads to efficiency." 
    <P>The government publishes a remarkable book purporting to explain the 
    corporate warrior to foreigners -- remarkable because it is utterly devoid 
    of the standard mystique. It suggests that there is indeed something inhuman 
    about the sarariman, though this has nothing to do with omnipotence born of 
    will. The cover of "Salaryman" in Japan pictures a middle-aged man with 
    sundry things floating around him: a newspaper, a computer, a barking boss, 
    a bento lunch box, a subway strap. These are the components of the man at 
    the center, it suggests, as if he were a manufactured assemblage. 
    "Salaryman" in Japan explains each tiny aspect of the sarariman's life. 
    Young sararimen carry this type of briefcase; the middle ranks, this type; 
    and those over fifty, this type. Middle-ranking sararimen must cope with 
    unreasonable superiors, selfish subordinates, large mortgages, and cheating 
    wives. Here are the sarariman's six variations on the smile; here is the 
    order by which sararimen of various ranks assemble themselves when riding in 
    a car. These points are advanced as if they were laws, which, in a way, they 
    are. The certainty of the text -- this is how the Japanese are, and there 
    are no deviations -- is an essential subtext, testimony to the stringent 
    conformity to which the sarariman submits. 
    <P>The average sarariman approaching retirement becomes a "window sitter" -- 
    someone rendered useless, whose desk is given to a younger manager and who 
    daydreams away the final years of his working life. In retirement he will be 
    known by another cruel nickname: "industrial waste." The little book 
    describes its sararimen at this stage with exceptional candor: 
    <P>Salarymen in their 50s turn to haiku, bonsai, or other traditional arts. 
    Many have begun to sense their own human limitations and use these pursuits 
    to fill the emptiness they feel with regard to everyday life. 
    <P>My first encounter with a sarariman outside of an office occurred late on 
    a rainy evening when I almost ran over one. Through a spring downpour, I 
    spotted a blue-suited body lying in the street not far from one of the train 
    stations serving suburban commuters. I stopped to look down upon him: He was 
    of early middle age, his face prematurely lined. He was drunk and drenched, 
    but alive. When he opened his eyes to discover a gaijin peering down at him, 
    he sucked in his breath and tried to compose himself, as if we were engaged 
    in a routine business encounter. 
    <P>One cannot draw too many conclusions from such an incident. Drunken 
    sararimen chasing late trains are an ordinary sight in Japanese cities. But 
    that is precisely the point. We must consider closely the truism that 
    after-hours drinking with clients and colleagues is an established part of 
    the sarariman routine -- a requirement of the job. For to witness the habits 
    of the sarariman at close range is to recognize the vast gulf between the 
    image of the sarariman -- an uplifting study in discipline and dedication -- 
    and the often degraded reality. 
    <P>For a long time the corporate-warrior ideal was a deception not only of 
    foreigners, we who look in from the outside, but a deception of the Japanese 
    themselves. There were many generations of aspiring K's. For a century and a 
    quarter after the oligarchs decided to make Japan a nation of samurai, the 
    Japanese struggled with the finer points, endeavoring to conform to the 
    image of the Japanese. Salvaging the corporate warrior was a thriving 
    industry during my years in Japan. The institute at Mount Fuji was reputed 
    to be the toughest of hell camps, but there were numerous other companies 
    whose business it was to cultivate the inner selves of sararimen. Is it 
    possible to induce an inner spirit in another -- to plant it, or inspire it, 
    or even create it? Or does the effort itself assume its object to be a 
    commodity -- "human material," as the institute at the foot of Mount Fuji 
    called its trainees? 
    <P>In Soseki's novel, K never becomes a modern samurai. Try as he will he is 
    unable to deny his humanity -- his emotions, frailties, hesitations, and so 
    on. In the end he recognizes that his real weakness lies in his impulse to 
    take refuge from the complexity of ordinary human relationships in the 
    idealized, unattainable past of the unbending warrior. Afraid to face life 
    as an individual, the warrior's code no longer any help, K commits suicide. 
    <P>Doesn't the sarariman industry suggest precisely the same point: that the 
    company samurai is essentially an imaginary image -- and a rather 
    destructive one at that? When the oligarchs turned the way of the warrior 
    into social convention it atrophied; as all such ideals do, it became mere 
    form. Today the Japanese call the first decades after the war the "golden 
    age" of the sarariman. But this is mere myth. There was never a golden age 
    for Japanese employees -- only a brief period of acquiescence. The institute 
    at the base of Mount Fuji was founded in 1967 -- when the golden age was 
    supposed to have been at its height. It was then, in the late 1960s, that 
    the long deception of the modern Japanese began to reveal itself for what it 
    was. the samurai with a briefcase is an old figure. In 1616, early in the 
    Tokugawa peace, a warrior near Kyoto took the radical step of putting away 
    his blades. "No more shall we have to live by the sword," he told his 
    household. "Great profits can be made honorably. I shall brew sake and soy 
    sauce, and we shall prosper." This may sound like dissonant advertising 
    copy, but Sokubei Mitsui turned out to be a clever man. With those words he 
    founded what is now the world's oldest industrial corporation (which still 
    bears the family name). 
    <P>After the restoration, when the Meiji oligarchy withdrew their rice 
    stipends and sent samurai into the new society to fend for themselves, the 
    old soldiers rushed into the era's rising new enterprises. They soon staffed 
    the offices of favored firms and became skilled workers at the shipyards, 
    munitions plants, and machinery factories designated (in today's terms) 
    strategic industries. They made little distinction between office workers 
    and those on the shop floor: They were all still warriors together. 
    <P>The decommissioned samurai were just the kind of employees a nation in a 
    hurry needed. They believed in loyalty and they had some notion of national 
    purpose. And it was natural that they brought the samurai code with them. 
    The early sararimen were the first modern Japanese rewarded with ranks and 
    regular wage increases. Companies became their ie, their households, so 
    translating into the modern world the sense of belonging they had drawn from 
    being part of a daimyo's army. But there were not enough samurai to go 
    around. Industries were burgeoning. Who would work in them? Commoners had 
    little sense of the old virtues as the samurai understood them -- to say 
    nothing of national purpose. So the story of the corporate foot soldier has 
    mostly to do with how Japan remedied this problem by encouraging commoners 
    to take up "the beautiful customs" found in the samurai code. 
    <P>When the modern system finally took shape, during the 1920s, loyalty did 
    not come naturally from the past. Japanese enterprises bought it -- a wise 
    transaction from their point of view. The promise of lifetime employment 
    produced managers and wage earners prepared to devote their lives to 
    prestigious companies. These companies sought not talent but a certain 
    character -- moldable clay. It did not matter what one learned at school, 
    apart from elementary skills and some fundamental discipline. An employee 
    was instructed not only in practical talents but also in the corporate 
    equivalent of moral <B>education</B> -- company values, the true character 
    of a Sumitomo employee, and so on. Lessons absorbed, the new company men 
    were shakai-jin, social beings -- that is, recognized members of society. 
    <P>To commoners in from the countryside -- hayseeds who had never worn a 
    suit or sat in a chair -- the modern company was something like their 
    household and something like the old village. From their companies flowed 
    their new sense of social place. Neither office managers nor factory hands 
    identified with their skills, or even their careers -- only with their 
    companies. And it is when companies are understood as households or villages 
    that corporate dormitories, company-arranged marriages, and all the other 
    practices that blur the public and the private in urban Japan are 
    comprehensible. That is why, even today, any earnest sarariman introduces 
    himself by putting the company name, like the family name, first. "I'm from 
    Sankei Steamship. Watanabe." "I'm Nissan's Fujimoto." 
    <P>Corporate values took the place of the civic values modern Japan never 
    developed. One could not switch companies any more than one could switch 
    households or families, for example. To do so was to display such lack of 
    virtue that it was impossible to be hired by any other large enterprise. One 
    could leave a company only in favor of an existence outside the system; some 
    did, but it was always to enter a less certain way of life, a life beyond 
    the circle of the chosen. 
    <P>The circle of the chosen was small. In prewar Japan the large enterprises 
    propelling the country forward employed less than a third of the labor 
    force. In its rush to match the West, Japan built a few modern industries -- 
    textiles, mining, steel, shipbuilding -- and left the rest of the economy 
    more or less to its own devices. Japan became two things at once. It 
    claimed, with justification, to be a rising industrial power; five years 
    into our century it proved the point by defeating the Russians at sea. At 
    the same time, Japan remained an underdeveloped nation. The latter condition 
    remains surprisingly large and well hidden today, though it is right before 
    our eyes. What we consider typical Japanese companies -- with company songs 
    and uniforms, robots, and spotless dining halls -- account for less than 1 
    percent of all businesses. The rest, those with less than $1 million in 
    capital and fewer than three hundred employees, ship half of all Japanese 
    manufactures and account for 80 percent of retail sales in Japan. 
    <P>Behind the names familiar to any consumer -- Sony, Toyota, NEC -- are 
    their captive subcontractors, where employment is uncertain and conditions 
    unattractive. A company such as Honda controls many thousands of suppliers. 
    This is called the satellite manufacturing system. It was invented during 
    the 1930s to maximize munitions production, and since Japan now exports it, 
    it will be more or less familiar to any British or American employee of a 
    Japanese subsidiary. Beneath the subcontractors are front-parlor factories 
    -- households where parts are assembled, stamped, or cut and packed off up 
    the production ladder. Enter one and you find a single piece of equipment 
    squeezed into a tatami-matted living room. Husband, wife, daughter, and 
    neighbors will take regular shifts on the family machine. Living room 
    factories doing piecework number in the hundreds of thousands. 
    <P>As they did a century ago, most Japanese still work in the small 
    factories down the narrow back lanes of the cities, or at the end of dirt 
    tracks in the countryside. Small enterprises employ as few as one or two 
    workers and as many as three hundred. But there are many thousands of them. 
    They were on the periphery of the modernization project, but they were the 
    backbone of the economy. Today, small subcontractors employ about two-thirds 
    of the manufacturing workforce. 
    <P>Few Japanese -- roughly one of five employees -- enjoy the benefits of 
    the genuine corporate warrior. In blue chip Japan, wages and salaries are as 
    much as 45 percent above those paid by smaller companies. But the economy is 
    an immense field of aspiration, as it has been since 1868. Small and 
    medium-sized companies struggle to follow the practices of blue chip 
    corporations as best they can. And the sarariman, like the samurai, is 
    idealized and emulated by the great mass of ordinary people, who can only 
    dream of becoming one. 
    <P>What was the object of this dream? The answer seems obvious. There were 
    the pay and the perquisites, of course, and the security. Still, why would 
    someone wish to emulate those who strive to make themselves "inhuman"? In 
    the beginning, in the years of K, it must have been simply to belong, for 
    the early sarariman was the modern Japanese -- Western in method, native in 
    spirit. After the war it was more or less the same: The sarariman carried 
    the nation forward in its newly defined purpose. So the dream was 
    understandable in these respects, a dream of identity: Who does not want to 
    make good in whatever way society defines it? But can a dream survive as the 
    harsh reality reveals itself? Does one want to make good when making good 
    might mean, quite literally, working oneself to death? 
    <P>Early one morning in July of 1990, a forty-seven-year-old section chief 
    at Mitsui &amp; Company stepped into the shower in a Nagoya hotel room. 
    Fluent in Russian, Jun Ishii was to lead a tour of Russian clients through a 
    plant that made machine tools. 
    <P>Ishii never finished his shower. Midway through he collapsed and died of 
    heart failure. He had made ten trips to Russia over the previous year -- he 
    had, in fact, just completed one -- and he had taken countless groups of 
    Russians around Japan. Mitsui soon paid Ishii's family 30 million yen, about 
    a quarter of a million dollars, in compensation. Two years later, a Tokyo 
    court ordered the government to pay Ishii's widow 2 million yen yearly for 
    the rest of her life. It ruled that Ishii was a victim of karoshi, death 
    from overwork. 
    <P>Jun Ishii's fate was not unusual. The year he died an organization 
    assisting the families of karoshi victims estimated that ten thousand 
    employees per year die from the stress of overwork. Other claims had been 
    recognized as legitimate before Ishii's death, but those cases involved 
    manual laborers at small companies. With Jun Ishii, Japan officially 
    admitted for the first time that a corporate warrior could die of 
    dedication. 
    <P>Karoshi victims often haunt their families. Spouses recall prefiguring 
    signs they failed to read: chronic fatigue, peculiar silences, insomnia, 
    headaches, unfocused eyes. Sometimes those who die leave behind suggestions 
    that they knew what was happening to them but, in typical Japanese fashion, 
    kept it to themselves. The living are usually left with the feeling that the 
    company and the country have betrayed them, which is why many families of 
    victims enter lengthy legal battles to win recognition of what actually 
    caused a sarariman's death. 
    <P>In 1988 a group of lawyers, professors, and physicians founded the 
    National Defense Council for Victims of Karoshi. The council set up hot 
    lines around the country and offered consultations to grieving families. By 
    its own account, the group was overwhelmed. There were 135 calls the first 
    day; after two years, the council had almost two thousand cases on its 
    books. 
    <P>The council also published a book, Karoshi: When the Corporate Warrior 
    Dies. It included this diary entry, by a forty-three-year-old man named 
    Toshitsugu Yagi: Let's think about slavery, then and now. 
    <P>In the past, slaves were loaded onto slave ships and carried off to the 
    new world. But in some way, aren't our daily commuter trains packed to 
    overflowing even more inhumane? 
    <P>And can't it be said that today's armies of corporate workers are in fact 
    slaves in almost every sense of the word? 
    <P>They are bought for money. 
    <P>Their worth is measured in working hours. 
    <P>They are powerless to defy their superiors. 
    <P>They have little to say in the way their wages are decided. 
    <P>And these corporate slaves of today don't even share the simplest of 
    pleasures that those forced laborers of ages past enjoyed; the right to sit 
    down at their dinner table with their families. 
    <P>These observations belong to someone who has discovered something that 
    contradicts what he has long believed about the meaning of his life and the 
    justness of his difficulties. The important point in the diary entry is what 
    is missing. There is nothing there about the sort of dedication we attach to 
    the sarariman and much to suggest that the modern corporation in Japan has 
    never been the sort of benevolent community it was supposed to be. Yagi 
    sounded like the plaintive shipyard worker who wrote of his inhuman 
    circumstances in 1922. Like the shipyard worker, Yagi described relations 
    based on the very unmodern notion of above-and-below, in which the one below 
    is powerless. 
    <P>Of course, people die of overwork in places other than Japan, often of 
    the same maladies. But we must be clear about the Japanese work ethic so 
    praised in the West. It has deep, unenviable roots in the feudal era. Edo 
    bureaucrats were quite conscious in their effort to make the common majority 
    a population of driven producers. Their motto was, "Don't let them live, but 
    don't let them die." They kept commoners desperate while advancing a 
    peculiar idea of moral duty. Virtue was measured in crop surpluses; filial 
    piety meant paying one's rice tributes. Samuraization only reinforced the 
    established compulsions. That is why Japanese employers have preferred the 
    beautiful customs to the rule of law. And it is why the case of Jun Ishii, 
    the Mitsui executive, had within it an echo that sounded far back in 
    history. 
    <P>While keeping his diary, Toshitsugu Yagi worked for a Tokyo advertising 
    agency that specialized in real estate ads. His death, in 1987, of a 
    myocardial infarction, occurred shortly after he wrote the above passage and 
    was the indirect result of a property frenzy that began with the economic 
    bubble in 1985 and lasted the rest of the decade. In the two years before 
    his death, Yagi was required to absorb a flood of new business, manage a new 
    financial subsidiary, and compensate for company cost cutting by extending 
    his overtime. Living almost two hours from Tokyo, Yagi rarely got home 
    before midnight. 
    <P>The case bears the usual marks of Japanese management practices. Pressure 
    to reduce costs is more or less constant, and overtime, especially in a 
    strong economic cycle, is more or less mandatory. Because such practices are 
    essential to Japan's ability to compete internationally, they are termed 
    "social dumping" -- that is, the use of exploitative employment standards to 
    keep prices below those of competitors. I once visited a maker of 
    construction equipment where each employee worked thirty hours a month in 
    overtime -- 360 hours a year. In effect, each six workers did the work of a 
    seventh. Put another way, the plant's forty-three hundred employees did the 
    work of just over five thousand, were overtime eliminated. 
    <P>Mitsue Yagi, the ad executive's widow, was denied compensation in her 
    claim of karoshi after a two-year battle with the Labor Ministry. The 
    ministry cannot be faulted for failing to acknowledge the karoshi syndrome. 
    It does. But it recognizes overwork only if the victim was on the job for 
    twenty-four hours immediately before death or sixteen hours daily for the 
    preceding seven days. By 1996 fewer than a hundred claims had been 
    officially recognized of the many thousands that were probably legitimate 
    since the term was invented, in 1978, by Tetsunojo Uehata, a physician who 
    helped start the council for victims' families. The Mitsui case was 
    important, but no second case involving a sarariman has been recognized 
    since. 
    <P>When Dr. Uehata invented the term, he defined karoshi as a condition in 
    which psychologically unsound work processes are allowed to continue in a 
    way that disrupts the worker's normal work and life rhythms . . . and 
    finally result in a fatal breakdown. The council applied this definition to 
    the fifty thousand employees between thirty and fifty-nine who die annually 
    from strokes or other heart ailments. The conclusion it reached -- that 20 
    percent of this group are karoshi victims -- is usually considered a 
    conservative estimate. 
    <P>Karoshi is a perfect example of the unusual integration of the Japanese 
    system. High land prices force employees to accept long, crowded commutes, 
    cramped housing, heavy mortgage burdens, and poor leisure facilities -- all 
    of which encourage overwork. In such an unpromising environment, parents 
    seeking maximum advantage for their children push them into cram schools and 
    long hours of homework. Keeping children in the right schools forces fathers 
    to accept tanshin funin, one-body transfer, the practice of leaving families 
    behind when a sarariman is moved to another city. There are no reliable 
    statistics regarding tanshin funin, but executives living solitary lives 
    away from home are commonly thought to number at least half a million, and 
    they are prime candidates for death by karoshi. 
    <P>Toshiro Ueyanagi, a lawyer at the defense council, discussed these things 
    one winter afternoon at the council's offices, down a narrow street in 
    Tokyo. In the 1970s karoshi was concentrated in a few categories, he said -- 
    journalists, night-shift workers, taxi drivers. It grew after the oil 
    shocks, when companies began talking about "stripped-down management." And 
    in the 1990s, he said, "the problem is everywhere." New technology helped 
    karoshi spread by allowing drastic cuts in the labor force. Nissan Motors, 
    to take one example, eliminated 15 percent of its labor force between 1985 
    and 1988. But automakers are not to be singled out. Despite their prominence 
    in Japan, they are typical companies. So are the lives of their employees. 
    Here is how the wife of a Toyota employee described her family routine to 
    the defense council: 
    <P>Night shift is extremely trying, living in two small rooms (four and a 
    half and six tatami mats) and a kitchen and caring for a one-year-old and a 
    three-year-old. After my husband goes to sleep the children can't shout or 
    play, let alone cry. So we spend most of the time outdoors, taking diapers 
    and snacks to the park. Rain presents a real problem. At times like this we 
    visit neighbors or friends whose husbands work the opposite shift. We cope 
    by helping one another out in this way. From about the third day of the 
    night shift, fatigue makes my husband uncharacteristically ill tempered. At 
    the company he works under the same conditions he would working days, even 
    though he has not been able to sleep properly for a week. There have been 
    times when I have found myself unthinkingly bringing my hands together in 
    silent prayer as I watched my exhausted husband set out for work. 
    <P>In 1992 the government declared that it would reduce the hours the 
    average employee works annually to 1,800 by the year 1997. At the time of 
    the announcement, officially measured hours were 2,200. This figure compared 
    with 1,900 hours in the United States and 1,650 in Germany. The plan was 
    part of a broader idea to make Japan a leader in raifu-sutairu, lifestyle -- 
    a favorite government theme at the time. But most experts greeted the plan 
    with skepticism. The government, after all, had been talking about a 
    five-day workweek and reduced working hours since the mid-1970s. One 
    problem, if not the principal one, was the difficulty of controlling 
    overtime no matter what companies did to reduce the hours of a regular work 
    shift. 
    <P>Overtime is an essential feature of Japan's social dumping. It comes in 
    several varieties. Apart from paid overtime, there is the overtime expected 
    of sararimen who work at home, and there is the overtime worked because 
    employees are not expected to take their allotted vacations. Corporations 
    have brought court cases against employees who refuse to work overtime. Most 
    important, though, is unrecorded overtime, known as "service overtime," in 
    which employees work without pay as a token of loyalty. Even a government 
    survey calculated that, with overtime included, actual hours worked at the 
    start of the 1990s came to 2,400 yearly for the average employee, and 2,600 
    for the average male. Other studies showed that year in, year out, service 
    overtime brought the hours of many sararimen well above the 3,000 mark. 
    <P>Toshiro Ueyanagi, the lawyer for victims' families, was pessimistic about 
    changing such practices, because they were so deeply entrenched. "I'm 
    skeptical about changes in the political system or the core economic system, 
    and that's where change first has to take place. There's a reluctance to see 
    the reality of the lives of ordinary people because there's reluctance to 
    change the way ordinary people live." 
    <P>Ueyanagi gave me the telephone number of the Ogawa family, who lived in a 
    three-room apartment at the end of a long train ride into the western 
    outskirts of Tokyo. Takamasu Ogawa, a balding, heavyset man of fifty-nine, 
    was not strictly a karoshi victim. He had survived the stroke he had 
    suffered six years before I met him, but only to witness the frustration and 
    anguish his family went through afterward. 
    <P>Ogawa had worked for a small firm that traded in electrical products -- 
    tapes, tubes, treated paper, chemicals. Some of these items weighed a 
    hundred pounds when packaged in bulk, and Ogawa serviced clients with them 
    in an area that required two hundred miles of driving daily. According to 
    his time cards, Ogawa routinely worked twelve hours a day, excluding 
    commuting time of almost three hours. He had every other Saturday off, but 
    keeping his account books took up his free weekends. 
    <P>Several days before he collapsed at the office, his wife, Yoshika, 
    noticed signs of stress that she understood only afterward. He had 
    complained of headaches; he dozed frequently and breathed heavily in his 
    sleep. In the evenings just before March 28, 1987, he would crawl from 
    dinner to his futon, skipping his customary hour of television. That day, 
    while discussing a troublesome client with his supervisor, Ogawa felt an 
    intense pain rush to his head. Then he collapsed. The coma lasted three 
    weeks. 
    <P>It was hard to look at Ogawa directly. He sat in a wheelchair at the 
    kitchen table, the right side of his face and the left side of his body 
    paralyzed. He had round, thick features and a gray crew cut. A photograph 
    taken a few years earlier showed a fit, athletic man: He had grown heavy 
    only since his stroke. Now he recounted his breakdown in clotted phrases. 
    His golf clubs, in a large leather bag, stood in the kitchen corner. 
    <P>After a time he paused, and Yoshika started to speak. 
    <P>"After the stroke we called the company president about using disability 
    insurance toward the hospital costs," she began. "At first he said, 'I 
    understand.' On our next visit he said, 'We can't do it.' Then the company 
    said he should resign without any guarantees. Finally he came home from the 
    hospital, a year and a month later." 
    <P>Impatient with details, Ogawa caught my eye. "My eldest son got married 
    two days ago," he said. His face broke into something between a laugh and a 
    cry, and I was unsure which. 
    <P>Yoshika resumed talking. Her trail eventually led to the victims' defense 
    council. It helped her apply to the local ward office, the metropolitan 
    labor office, and the Labor Ministry, the last arguing that Ogawa had had 
    too many Saturdays off to qualify for disability benefits. None of these 
    applications had received a final ruling. At that moment, Yoshika was trying 
    to obtain copies of Ogawa's company files, which both the government and the 
    company were withholding. 
    <P>Ogawa interrupted again. "It's taking too long," he barked. "We have 
    lives to lead." 
    <P>Then Ogawa's face broke up again. For a moment he looked like a large, 
    helpless infant. This time I was certain it was the closest he could come to 
    crying. 
    <P>The idea of what it meant to be modern took a fundamental turn after 
    1945. Until the imperial state was defeated, making Japan modern was a means 
    to an end. Japan needed industry so that it could resist foreigners. 
    Modernization, it could be said, was a way to preserve identity, culture, 
    and "tradition." After the war this notion was turned upside down. 
    Modernization became the goal, and "tradition" the means. There is another 
    way to put it: At the odd intersection of economics and psychology one finds 
    ideology -- imperial ideology before the war, the ideology of growth 
    afterward. The postwar ideology's detractors called it "GNPism," denoting 
    the new obsession with gross national product. The critics were many, and 
    GNPism may indeed seem a grim prospect. But for many more it was liberating 
    when put against what had come before. GNPism gave the defeated Japanese 
    something to strive for other than the discredited imperial state. And soon 
    enough the ideology of growth led to the myth of the sarariman's golden age. 

    <P>The myth of the golden age was not solely about striving at the 
    workplace. The Japanese also became consumers for the first time. The 
    Americans, who developed their own consumption mania after the war, were an 
    important influence. The Japanese were awed by the easy manners of the 
    occupation G.I.'s and the flood of postwar Hollywood films full of sprawling 
    houses and unimaginable appliances: That was the way one lived the modern, 
    independent life. With the Income-Doubling Plan, begun after the AMPO 
    episode in 1960, the national idée fixe switched from reconstruction to high 
    growth, and consumption was more or less as patriotic as making one's quota 
    at the company. 
    <P>But consumption has always been a complicated business for the Japanese. 
    It had a peculiar past when the Japanese first turned themselves into 
    consumers, and it has had unexpected consequences in our time. 
    <P>For many centuries austerity was more than a habit -- it was a virtue, an 
    aesthetic value, and finally a legal dictum. The Tokugawa shogun put strict 
    limits on consumption, especially of the conspicuous kind. Merchants 
    indulged themselves with relish in the pleasure quarters of the main cities, 
    sumptuary laws or no. But they were feudal Japan's shame, the lowest of the 
    castes. In the modern era there was a consumption craze during the 1920s, 
    the high point of prewar westernization. It was during the twenties that an 
    urban middle class first appeared. But there was something a bit unseemly 
    about consuming then, too. It was too individualistic; it was private -- 
    which was to say selfish. It suggested that one had thoughts of one's own 
    that had nothing to do with the emperor and the good of the state. 
    <P>After the war to consume was to declare one's autonomy, but it was a 
    self-deceiving declaration. Consumption was less about the "selfhood" 
    intellectuals were debating than the Japanese propensity to dream. There was 
    the relatively early phenomenon of the burenda, the electric blender. The 
    rage for blenders in the early 1950s must have been extraordinary, for 
    Japanese alive then still remember it vividly. And here is the curious thing 
    about it: The foods one could process in a blender were nowhere to be found 
    in the markets. Most blenders went straight onto the top shelf, hidden icons 
    honoring the dream of another life. It was the same with cars. Widespread 
    car ownership became possible only in the late 1950s. But a driving license 
    was a mark of status much earlier, and the pepa doraiba, the paper driver, 
    was a familiar fellow in urban neighborhoods. 
    <P>Things accelerated in the mid-1950s, along with the economy. The fashion 
    for blenders eventually turned into the denka bumu, the electric boom, the 
    compulsive acquisition of household appliances of all varieties: vacuum 
    cleaners, refrigerators, and so on. A decade later came maikara (my color, 
    that is, my TV set), and maikura (my cooler, air conditioner), and so on. An 
    insightful advertising copywriter coined the term maihomu, my home. Maihomu 
    was more than an ad slogan: The borrowed possessive captured the new tilt 
    toward private gratification. The newspapers marked 1966 as the first year 
    of maika, my car. 
    <P>Maika reveals something of what lay beneath the consumption phenomenon. 
    No modern invention is better equipped to plow roughshod over the old 
    Confucian constraints. In any city or town one can cruise through crowded 
    streets with a kind of anonymous, private aggression. One shuts out the 
    world and its burdens and obligations simply by rolling up the windows. 
    Certainly this helps explain the persistent popularity of cars in a nation 
    that barely has enough road to accommodate the number purchased. It also 
    explains why people ordinarily so observant of the inbred politesse are 
    atrociously combative behind the wheel. A few years after the national 
    dailies declared the year of maika, the car became known as hashiru kyoki, 
    the runaway weapon. 
    <P>In the consumption bumu lies another of the ironies of postwar life in 
    Japan. In the end it did nothing for the sarariman's sense of independence. 
    It was merely a retreat into privacy, which is a different thing. Dreaming 
    and consuming, the one encouraging the other, are an expensive combination. 
    It was the sarariman, of course, who paid the bills for the urban 
    household's acquisitions. And far from keeping the corporation out of the 
    home, the new consumption was the corporation's way of reentering it. The 
    line between public and private life was not redrawn but further 
    obliterated. During the car craze of the 1960s and 1970s it was not unusual 
    for the crowded urban household to turn the front parlor into garage space 
    for maika -- a perfect expression of what really happened to the sarariman 
    during his golden age. 
    <P>There is an unbroken line between the relentless mai's of the 1960s and 
    the binge consumption of the 1980s. Products developed toward the end of the 
    last decade -- computerized toilet bowls, toothpaste flecked with gold -- 
    suggested a consumption culture run amok. The mass-consumption dream reached 
    such an extreme that the urban Japanese ran out of room to put things in 
    their cramped houses and apartments. Waste disposal became a national 
    preoccupation. When I arrived in Japan the volume of refuse had begun to 
    overtake the capacity of artificial landfills in Tokyo Bay -- city dumps 
    named, with no intended irony, the Dream Islands. 
    <P>But in a certain way consumption had again taken on the subversive edge 
    it had in the deep past. It is true that Japanese consumers fueled the 
    bubble of the late 1980s, and that the bubble dramatically increased Japan's 
    imports -- so easing a trade issue that had reached a critical stage. But 
    the consumption of the time was like the indulgences of the feudal townsmen: 
    The shogun disapproved of the rich merchants of Edo and Osaka because 
    consumption made apparent the matter of difference. And that is just what 
    the indulgences of the 1980s did. 
    <P>Famously, 90 percent of postwar Japanese long believed they were part of 
    the middle class -- an impossibility, but an article of faith nonetheless. 
    It is nearer the truth to say that, as in many primitive societies, 
    difference was suppressed to contain envy. The control of envy has a long 
    tradition in Japan; everyone knows it lurks just beneath the surface of 
    sameness. Consumption in the 1950s and 1960s was all about sameness: 
    Everyone had a burenda, everyone a television. The 1980s were different. Not 
    everyone had a mink-trimmed Mercedes; not everyone bought floral bouquets 
    wrapped in sheets of uncut dollar bills. The consumption of the eighties, 
    based not on hard work but on stock and land speculation, created a new and 
    conspicuous class of narikin, as the Japanese call the nouveaux riches -- 
    niyu ritchi in the parlance of the decade. 
    <P>And as the mask of sameness dropped, the self-denying corporate soldier, 
    modern Japan's ultimate conformist, began to seem an anachronism, even a bit 
    of a dupe. to understand this we must return briefly to the early 1970s, 
    when Japan took several serious blows -- shokku, it called them. The yen was 
    revalued against the American dollar after two decades at a favorable rate. 
    Then the system of floating exchange rates began. Then came the first oil 
    shock. The shokku wreaked economic havoc. Japan Inc.'s bureaucratic 
    engineers did not handle them well. Growth slowed and inflation soared. 
    Tokyo had to choke off the consumption spree to combat spiraling prices. 
    Companies retrenched, and unemployment reappeared for the first time since 
    the economic confusion of the late 1940s. This was the period, incidentally, 
    when karoshi, death from overwork, also made its first appearance. 
    <P>Japan quickly recovered from the shokku. By mid-decade the economy was 
    back on track, and many years of growth lay ahead. Japan Inc. was fighting 
    trim -- a little leaner and meaner, we would say. But Japan never really 
    came back from the shokku, which is why they are worth recalling. The 
    Japanese began to separate economics from psychology for the first time. 
    Eternal economic growth was discredited as an overarching value. Even before 
    the shokku many Japanese had begun questioning the human and ecological 
    costs of GNPism; afterward, a purely material response to life no longer 
    seemed adequate. At the moment the economy entered its mature phase -- which 
    is what the shokku were all about -- the old collective effort gave way to 
    renewed ruminations as to the place of the individual. That is why one needs 
    both economists and psychologists to understand this singular moment. "After 
    the oil shocks," one of the latter once told me, "we lost our belief in 
    unending progress. We lost our transcendent guide." 
    <P>It was precisely such a Japan -- unguided, without beliefs -- that began 
    to look once more at what it meant to be modern. And it could only be a 
    matter of time -- a decade, to be precise -- before the Japanese began to 
    look with a certain distance at the way they had chosen. Did they really 
    need the way of the warrior to be good, modern Japanese? Did they need the 
    corporation as it had presented itself to them -- the corporation as 
    village, as household? 
    <P>In the spring of 1993 a politician named Ichiro Ozawa, a rising star in 
    conservative circles, published an influential book about the future of 
    Japan. Among the many striking observations in Blueprint for a New Japan 
    were these about the sarariman ideal: 
    <P>Individuals have to be liberated from their companies. It is only when 
    each individual becomes able to act autonomously that we will see the birth 
    of a richly diverse and dynamic society. 
    <P>The way we are employed is in no way a traditional Japanese construct. It 
    is something that developed during the period of rapid growth . . . Japan is 
    no longer catching up. We now rank alongside the United States as an 
    economic power. The social framework tied to rapid growth is no longer 
    appropriate. No member of the political elite, least of all someone of 
    Ozawa's prominence and authority, had ever thought to d
    <P>emolish the myth of the corporate samurai. Ozawa did so in a few direct 
    sentences for a simple reason. Japan could no longer afford "the beautiful 
    customs." With the economy in transition, neither were they any longer 
    useful. Employment figures offer a clear explanation. Japan reckons its 
    jobless rate at roughly three percent. Factor in the window sitters and so 
    on -- the "efficiency of accumulated inefficiency" -- and the rate triples, 
    according to some experts, who believe it will have to go higher still 
    before Japan regains its economic health. "Japan's most pressing need is a 
    change in the consciousness of our people," Ozawa wrote -- pressing because 
    lifetime employment, seniority raises, and all the rest of the samurai code 
    in its modern form had become a hindrance rather than an advantage. 
    <P>But what did Ozawa really mean? Who would direct these momentous changes? 
    Change has almost always taken place in Japan from above rather than below, 
    autocratically rather than democratically. And that is the most pressing 
    change of all. Ozawa wrote as an official of the central government -- as a 
    man "above," a man of the "great tradition." What about the ordinary 
    Japanese -- the "little tradition"? Ozawa was right about the need for a 
    change in consciousness. But what would it consist of? Many people -- many 
    sararimen and their spouses and children, the generation of the "new human 
    species" -- were way ahead of Ozawa on this point. It would be impossible to 
    change the system as Ozawa proposed without changing the dependence upon 
    authority Japan's leaders have long cultivated. That, again, is the most 
    pressing need of all. The outstanding question is whether men such as Ozawa, 
    and the corporations employing Japan's army of sararimen, will accept such a 
    change. For there were many signs of it by the time Ozawa attacked the 
    mythical corporate warrior. 
    <P>In 1991 a sarariman named Akio Koiso published another unusual book, 
    called Record of a Fuji Bank Man. Not much had ever been written about the 
    sarariman and the way the individual worker actually related to his company. 
    Koiso broke the colossal silence of the corporate warrior. And then a slew 
    of other sararimen gave firsthand accounts of the auto industry, the press, 
    the transportation industry, the mammoth life insurance companies -- the 
    institutions of Japan Inc. These were not stories of harmony and unified 
    purpose. They were tales of what Koiso called "coercive labor," full of 
    intimidating managers, corrupt union officials, executive suicides, karoshi 
    incidents, "service overtime" scams, vindictive personnel departments, and 
    employees banished to various Siberias for being too independent of mind. 
    <P>Akio Koiso was not an easy man to find. Whenever I called his office I 
    was turned away: He was in a meeting, he was traveling, he had not come in 
    that day. I finally reached Koiso at home. Yes, he said, the bank was no 
    longer letting him take telephone calls. We eventually met in the lobby of a 
    Tokyo hotel. Koiso turned out to be a modest man in his fifties. He wore his 
    hair in a low part, combing most of it over a balding pate. When he offered 
    his meishi, it read simply, "Akio Koiso, Fuji Bank Employee." No rank, no 
    section -- no clue to his place on the pyramid. 
    <P>Koiso began working at Fuji, a large commercial bank, at the beginning of 
    the Income-Doubling Plan, in 1960. His career coincided with what he called 
    "massification" -- torrid competition between banks for the savings accounts 
    that provided industry with the cheap, stable capital that paid for the 
    "miracle." Massification has produced workloads that increase with each 
    technological advance. In his book Koiso recalled a "maximization of 
    efficiency" plan from his early days at the bank: 
    <P>Branches were assessed according to targets set by headquarters and by 
    comparisons with other branches. This assessment included expansion of 
    clients, fixed-term accounts, savings accounts, direct payroll deposits, and 
    so on. People in charge of favored clients had to visit twenty or more 
    daily. Twenty-five percent of the marketing staff was to be eliminated in 
    three years, along with 10 percent of total personnel. Reducing expenses 
    meant rationing ballpoint pens, removing lights, and "spontaneous rejection" 
    of overtime pay. . . . Twenty-five years after its introduction, this system 
    is still in place. . . . 
    <P>From the beginning Koiso had concerned himself with the way Fuji treated 
    its employees, and he soon rose to the top of the union local. It was not a 
    good career move. Koiso's fate was sealed when he insisted on reporting all 
    his overtime and, later, when he opposed the bank for ignoring even the 
    government's lax labor standards. Not surprising, he was transferred five 
    times, usually from one desolate rural branch to another. Unable to dump 
    Akio Koiso, whose hard work often won him the support of branch managers, 
    Fuji Bank tried to bury him. 
    <P>Koiso was a product of the AMPO era: He had expected Japan to change at 
    that critical moment and had lived with disappointment ever since. But he 
    saw the system passing, partly because banks and corporations had new, 
    global ambitions. In Record of a Fuji Bank Man Koiso wrote, "This kind of 
    contradiction -- depending on internationally unacceptable working 
    conditions to become an international company -- cannot go on forever." 
    <P>As we sipped coffee Koiso expanded on this point. "When you enter a firm, 
    substantially what takes place is a giri-on relationship, the old type of 
    relationship in which obligations are created and then must be observed. By 
    giving on to employees -- benefit, kindness -- management creates giri, 
    duty. It weakens the employees' sense of autonomy. That is how Japan works. 
    But you can't impose these kinds of practices overseas." 
    <P>Koiso was eager to pursue the theme. "Another thing carried into the 
    workplace after the war was military style. We call the branch manager 
    oyagi, an informal form of 'father.' This is true in most big companies. It 
    came from the army, where you would call the platoon leader oyagi. An order 
    from the oyagi was an absolute order. The practice began after the 
    Russo-Japanese War. It fostered 'familyism,' the idea that you should think 
    of the army as your family." 
    <P>I wondered what would replace the system beginning to fade. Koiso did not 
    know. "I don't think it'll be like France or Germany or the United States. 
    It'll be Japanese. I've got no concrete image in mind. Younger people are 
    good at putting things into practice. But the example of Meiji tells us 
    something. Lower-ranking samurai learned from the West, but they didn't pass 
    on what they learned -- they modified it. This will happen again to change 
    the system into something socially, morally, and internationally 
    acceptable." 
    <P>When Koiso got up he turned toward me and, as if to leave behind some 
    reassuring message, said simply, "The power of the past is weakening." This 
    was a shrewd view of things. Turmoil among Japanese wage earners and 
    managers is now an evident feature of the economy, as it is in America and 
    elsewhere. Then, it was just beginning. Companies laid off senior managers 
    -- proven corporate warriors. They reneged on their naitei, job guarantees 
    extended to university seniors, an institution as sacred as lifetime 
    employment. People found it difficult to give up the security of the old 
    system. But I had no doubt Koiso was right: The past was fading. 
    <P>During my last year in Japan I used to meet with researchers at the 
    Recruit Company. Most foreigners familiar with Recruit know it as the 
    company behind a late-1980s political scandal. But Recruit was central to 
    the Japanese employment system. It helped corporations connect with 
    graduates entering the job market -- hence its name. Recruit had grown rich 
    in the 1980s because companies were ever more mystified about the people 
    they were trying to attract. It was an important nexus in the system. The 
    researchers I met were young, stylish executives in a group called the Work 
    Design Institute. Their job was to advise corporate clients how best to 
    appeal to young, stylish executives-to-be. The institute was started in 
    1989. It published a great deal of research and statistical matter. 
    Periodically it produced a glossy magazine on a single theme: how Europeans 
    spend their leisure time, for instance. It is fair to say that those at the 
    institute had the task of simply explaining themselves and their generation 
    to those who did not understand them. 
    <P>It was remarkable to find, among the ten or twelve people who attended 
    these sessions, unqualified derision for the system their parents had 
    accepted -- the system that had produced the affluence they enjoyed. But as 
    a shared sentiment this was a given, something not even discussed. When I 
    first arrived, I asked one of the leaders what he did. He beat his chest and 
    said in English, "I am Mister Company, a business soldier." Everyone 
    laughed. People no longer even used that phrase, I supposed. "Only 
    ironically," said one of his colleagues, a woman in her late twenties. 
    <P>The irony masked mystification. I sensed as the meetings went on that it 
    was hard for these people to find enough distance to know even themselves, 
    to say nothing of their parents and what they had lived for. These people 
    worked hard, too, but that was not the issue. Among much else, the group was 
    struggling with the idea that people could live in a variety of ways. Such a 
    thing had not occurred to the Japanese since the early postwar years. 
    <P>"Why is there the phenomenon of karoshi?" someone asked in one session. 
    "There is no answer to this." 
    <P>I suggested, "People overwork because they have no mechanism within 
    themselves that allows them to say no." 
    <P>"Then why are young people not the same way?" 
    <P>The group slipped into a discussion in rapid Japanese. A younger member 
    of the institute turned to me and explained. "At this moment we are asking, 
    'What is a corporation?' and 'Why did men think in a way that produced 
    something like karoshi?'" The conversation was part of a long study they 
    were finishing. It would go to the core of the matter: the relationship 
    between the sarariman and the company. 
    <P>"There was the corporation, and the sarariman belonged to it," the group 
    leader said. "But people don't feel the same loyalty anymore. So companies 
    have to come up with a new method of management. The issue is how to make 
    fundamental change in the way companies relate to their employees. Most 
    companies share the same problem. They simply don't know how to treat 
    people." 
    <P>There was something peculiar about the group. Amid all the rumination, 
    its members were skeptics. Older people like Akio Koiso, who had lived 
    through the system for so long, were more optimistic about change than those 
    younger, from whom change was supposed to spring. Perhaps they did not trust 
    themselves as they watched friends graduate and step quickly onto the 
    treadmill. Like many generations before them, they evinced that common 
    Japanese mix of emotions, desire without hope. But within a year of the 
    meetings at Recruit such companies as Honda, Toyota, and Nomura, the sort of 
    blue chip corporations emulated by all others, were trying new salary 
    systems, promotions based on merit, and short-term contracts that left 
    people free to change jobs -- left them loyal to themselves. 
    <P>I once traveled to the shores of Biwako, Japan's largest lake, northeast 
    of Kyoto, where forty young men and women were in training. They had just 
    joined the Toray Corporation, a leading maker of synthetic fibers. I arrived 
    on a warm day in April, not long after university graduations. A gray-haired 
    man in a light blue suit -- trousers and a waist-length Eisenhower jacket -- 
    stood on a raised platform in front of a microphone. An oval above his 
    breast pocket gave his name as Muneishi. 
    <P>A veteran sarariman, Muneishi-san was part drill sergeant and part camp 
    counselor. He divided the room into four teams, each of which appointed a 
    salesman, a receptionist, a junior sarariman, and a kacho, a section chief. 
    The exercise was simple: The salesman arrives, greets the receptionist, asks 
    to see the kacho, is shown into the sarariman's office. The sarariman then 
    fetches the kacho: end of exercise. There was much bowing, exchanging of 
    meishi, talk of the weather, business chat, and so on. Each skit lasted a 
    few minutes. Sometimes the actors spoke so diffidently that you could hardly 
    hear them. When they finished, Muneishi-san gave his scores. 
    <P>"Team A, your manner was quite good. But you left out the discussion of 
    price and deadline. These are important in business. Minus one point." The 
    score went up on a blackboard. The people at Team A's table fidgeted in 
    their seats. 
    <P>"Team B, your salesman didn't offer his meishi. Minus one. Then your 
    junior clerk didn't present his meishi at the right time. Minus one." 
    <P>Someone on another team didn't say, "Thank you very much," when a meishi 
    was presented. Minus a point. Someone else put a proffered meishi in his 
    pocket. Minus three: The meishi must remain on the table between two people 
    for the duration of a meeting. Someone else left his briefcase half opened 
    during his encounter with the junior sarariman. Minus one. 
    <P>A hand shot up. 
    <P>"I learned that you don't give a meishi to the receptionist. Is this 
    true?" 
    <P>"Hmmm." Muneishi-san wrestled half aloud with the conundrum: It is true, 
    but if you don't give your meishi to the receptionist, how does she know 
    whom to announce? "In my opinion," he concluded at last, "it's best if you 
    give your meishi to the receptionist, too, but only on the first visit. But 
    let me check on that." 
    <P>Afterward, I pulled aside a man named Yasuhiko Takibayashi. He had been a 
    salesman for his team and had incurred a minus or two -- demerits he 
    evidently took to heart. "It was difficult to grasp the timing -- to say 
    what I wanted to say while listening to my counterpart. The polite form was 
    hard, too." 
    <P>"What was difficult about the polite form?" 
    <P>"I'm not used to 'respect language.' And to complete a sentence clearly 
    was also hard." 
    <P>He was fresh from Hokkaido University and had grown up on the cool, 
    pastoral island in the north. He had the reticence one would expect of a 
    farmer's son transported, like millions before him, to the city. Takibayashi 
    wanted to work in the marketing section. But why Toray? "O.B.'s at 
    university -- I mean 'old boys' -- who went to manufacturing companies. One 
    who went to Toray came back and left a good impression." What was the 
    impression? "I learned that in Toray your opinion is valued, and you can do 
    what you want." 
    <P>Over the two days I spent at Toray's training camp they played with clay 
    -- each recruit fashioned a traditional flute -- and they played with words: 
    Half of each team was shown a map to a factory and, using only description, 
    had to tell the other half how to get there. They made telephone calls to 
    departments within the company. They wrote business letters and scheduled 
    appointments. To prepare for each task they studied thick manuals that 
    resembled the text-and-pictures format of "Salaryman" in Japan. Could I see 
    one? No, they were for "inside people." 
    <P>They were becoming shakai-jin, social beings. Making a flute taught them 
    something about creativity and about working alone. They learned how to 
    communicate with strangers. In the enacted scenes they began to grasp the 
    rules of business conduct, which were as simple and rigid and precise as any 
    of the decrees Tokugawa bureaucrats had issued to the samurai or the 
    peasants centuries earlier. 
    <P>When I arrived, a group of Toray executives greeted me. They had all seen 
    many freshmen begin their paths through the company. There was not much new 
    under the sun, it seemed to them. But one manager, a portly, severe man who 
    wore metal-framed glasses, did not especially approve. He said, "My very 
    personal opinion is that the younger generation still has some thinking to 
    do about whether they want to stay long-term with a company or quit. There's 
    still some doubt about it. They're undecided and uncommitted." 
    <P>I met a young woman named Yukiko Hayashi. She was not a migrant, but a 
    born-and-bred Tokyoite. Hayashi had graduated in sociology from Waseda, a 
    prestigious private university in the capital. She was small and alert and 
    casually dressed. Something of the undergraduate's slouch lingered about 
    her. It was easy to imagine her carrying a backpack full of books. "For me, 
    a woman, the priorities are different," Hayashi said. "I put more emphasis 
    on the atmosphere inside a company. I'm less interested in a company's name 
    than in a company where I can work freely." 
    <P>She was not unlike Takibayashi. But I wondered whether she considered 
    herself different from her parents' generation. "A little," Hayashi said. 
    "People want to work, but they want to enjoy their own time. It's not 
    either-or, though. You work to live, and not the other way around -- it's 
    getting that way. I hope the company will accept that." 
    <P>Maybe Hayashi had left behind disappointed friends when she packed off 
    for her weeks near Biwako. Maybe she left behind a piece of herself, also 
    disappointed. But there was nothing final about her commitment to Toray -- 
    the severe sarariman was right about that -- except her judgment of the 
    future. It contained something more than the familiar pessimism and desire. 
    <P>"Will young people change companies," I asked, "or will companies change 
    young people?" 
    <P>"It goes in both directions. This company, like most of the others, 
    sticks to the old ways. Before I came I thought, I want to change these 
    attitudes. But it's hard to change that quickly. On the other hand, we have 
    to change."
