<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Nature of Kiyojute Ryu Kempo Bugei</STRONG><FONT SIZE="-1"></FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE="-1">Most Kempo systems in the United States tend to derive from one source, the James Masayoshi Mitose lineage.
This has been passed throughout the country by students of William Chow, Ed Parker and others. There are a few
who proclaim their arts as Kempo Jujutsu, the same way that James Mitose did, while most designate their branch
Kempo Karate, due to the influence of William Chow. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE="-1">Interestingly enough, the first time that the Okinawan martial arts were introduced to Japan, they were called
Kempo Karate and when Chojun Miyagi brought them to Hawaii it was touted Kempo Karate as well. This is
where there has been a distinct misunderstanding of what the Oriental martial arts are, especially the art of Kempo. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE="-1">* * *</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE="-1">In ancient times, the martial arts were complete in nature and so were many times called Sogo Bujutsu, literally
comprehensive martial arts. The great Japanese historian, Seiko Fujita, noted that a typical list of skills taught in
true martial systems usually included as many as thirty-five or more arts. There were, according to some sources,
three main divisions: Kempo Bugei, Kakuto Bugei and Nimpo Bugei. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE="-1">Kempo Bugei, fist law martial arts, were those connected with temples either directly, meaning they taught at the
temples, or indirectly, referring to the family martial arts practiced by rural warriors, Jisamurai, who originally
learned them under the tutelage of warrior monks. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE="-1">Kakuto Bugei were the fighting martial arts of the Bushi clans. In some cases these arts were developed by the
fertile genius of the clan leaders. The most famous style of Kakuto Bugei is that founded by Yoshimitsu Minamoto,
which became known as Daito Ryu in modern times. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE="-1">Finally there are Nimpo Bugei, which were also connected with the temples. Where Kempo Bugei were most
closely associated with Zen Buddhism, Nimpo Bugei were associated with Mikkyo Buddhism. These were
Samurai clans located in the hills and more wild areas of Japan. Generally, these clans did not have close ties to </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;the central government and many times found themselves in opposition to national policy. These styles majored
on their own forms of Ninjutsu, however it should be noted that all forms of Bugei tended to have a branch of
Ninjutsu. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE="-1">* * *</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE="-1">James Masayoshi Mitose created an unusual blend of martial arts due to his training in Japan. It must be
remembered that Mitose was born in Hawaii, but at age five was sent home to receive formal training. According
to Mitose himself, he learned history, philosophy, as well as martial arts. This included Western history and
philosophy along with those of the east. Essentially, Mitose was raised a Buddhist priest, though later in his life he
became a Christian minister. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE="-1">While in Japan, he learned the family martial art, which was known as Kosho Ryu Kempo. According to Mitose, it
was a complete martial art, Sogo Bujutsu, which included weaponry, flower arranging, and empty handed skills.
This style was a true Bugei, in that many of the survival skills of the Samurai were preserved in the arts taught. Yet
this was not the end of the amount of skills in which Mitose trained. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE="-1">According to some sources, James Masayoshi Mitose's maternal uncle was the great Okinawan martial arts master
of Kempo Karate, Choki Motobu. While Motobu was in Japan, he was extremely famous and developed an
entourage, which followed him around the island. Among those who trained with Motobu was: Yasuhiro Konishi,
Kanei Kuniba, Tatsuo Yamada, Shoshin Nagamine, Shinsuke Kaneshima, Shinyei Kaneshima, Katsuya Miyahira,
Chozo Nakama, Tsuyoshi Chitose, Tatsuo Shimabuku, Eizo Shimabuku, Shigeru Nakamura, Seiko Fujita, and
most importantly for the martial arts in the United States, James Masayoshi Mitose. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE="-1">Note the name Seiko Fujita, he was the headmaster of Koga Ryu Ninjutsu. When Mitose taught in Hawaii, he
primarily taught Kosho Ryu Kempo, which was supposed to be derived from Shaolin Chuanfa, brought to Japan
during the Kamakura era. He also taught elements of Shorei Ryu Kempo Karate, the style founded by Choki
Motobu, including the use of the Makiwara. There are those who say that Mitose was disturbed by some of his
students toward violence. Thus in 1953, he retired from teaching and moved to California. Twenty years later he
thought he would come out of retirement and begin teaching again. This time he decided to teach the complete
martial art, including Ninjutsu. Suddenly, the complete martial arts, as taught in ancient times, were being taught in
the United States. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE="-1">Everyone is aware that Mitose was later accused of murder and sentenced to prison. There are many theories put
forth in this matter, with some saying that Mitose was an innocent victim. Still others say Mitose was the worst
criminal to have ever extorted money from innocent prey. This is a matter still being investigated, with much
evidence being on the side of the innocence of Mitose, but none the less, regardless what is decided by history,
Mitose taught the complete Kempo Bugei in the United States for the first time. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE="-1">* * *</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE="-1">The author began training in the martial arts under Richard Stone, who had eleven years of experience in the
martial arts, teaching Kodokan Judo, Aikikai Aikido, and Nippon Kempo. Like most young boys at the time, he
began to think in terms of self-defense in terms of combinations of arts. As he later learned Karate, Tae Kwon Do,
Ninjutsu, Tai Chi and other arts, he continued to seek to combine them in an eclectic fashion. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE="-1">Then a very special event happened, the author joined Juko Kai Kokusai Remmei, the international martial arts
union of Dr. Rod Sacharnoski. It was while training in the Juko Ryu arts, and other systems, in Juko Kai, that the
author began to realize the true comprehensive nature of the Asian martial arts. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE="-1">In 1982, Dr. Sacharnoski sponsored William Durbin before the Zen Kokusai Soke Remmei, a board of headmasters
including oriental and western martial artists, who seek to certify deserving martial artists and recognize their new
systems. Thus was founded Kiyojute Ryu Kempo Bugei, a comprehensive martial arts system, teaching a full range
of martial arts skills. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE="-1">Yet the author was not satisfied with his level of knowledge, but rather kept training with his three main
instructors: Richard Stone, Dr. Rod Sacharnoski and Bill 'Superfoot' Wallace. He also researched the many
branches of Kosho Ryu Kempo, eventually being certified by each branch head: Thomas Barro Mitose, Bruce
Juchnik and Nimr Hassan. During his research he found the roots of Kosho Ryu Kempo Jujutsu, Koga Ryu
Ninjutsu and Shorei Ryu Kempo Karate. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE="-1">Most of all the author found out that according to traditional Oriental martial arts thought, without weapons
training of a comprehensive nature, the arts may be thought of as a Budo not Bugei. Training must encompass
much more than the empty hand, which is especially true of the ancient Okinawan forms of Bushi Te. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE="-1">Through historical research the author has based the teachings of Kiyojute Ryu Kempo Bugei on the oldest forms
of training, which include: Mueki, a.k.a. Jiyu Kata, free form training which is not prearranged, which is the basis
of pre-Tokugawa Japanese Bujutsu Kata and the original Okinawan method of training; Embu, the paired,
noncompetitive method of training that allowed Shaolin monks to practice their martial arts, while maintaining
their vows of nonviolence; and Kihon Kumite, basic matching hand, as well as, it's variation known as Renzoku
Ken, continuous fist, the practice of combinations. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE="-1">The last two methods were used in Okinawa, with the aspect of Renzoku Ken being a method particularly
associated with Shorin Ryu and the Shorei Ryu of Choki Motobu. Many Kihon Kumite are used to teach Ikken, one
strike certain death, techniques for which Okinawan Karate is famous. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE="-1">* * *</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE="-1">There are six principles which must be comprehended if the martial arts are to be truly mastered. These are:
Aikiho, Bukiho, Goho, Juho, Nimpo and Shuho. Aikiho, which is the idea of harmonizing one's movement and
energy with that of an attacker, is probably one of the best known due to the proliferation of Aikido and Aikijujutsu
schools. Bukiho is the study of weapons, but more, the in-depth practice of universal movements which can be
applied to any item in a combative manner. Goho is the training required to coordinate the entire body into a
singular goal, be it performing a strike, executing a throw, or accomplishing a joint lock. Juho is obviously the
principle most associated with coordination of the body for using an opponent's strength against them, and is most
associated with Judo or Jujutsu. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE="-1">The last two principles are among the rarest concepts, though Nimpo is currently being touted by several ancient
Ryu which specialize in Ninjutsu. Nimpo is less an art and more of a doctrine of living. Nin, the root of the term,
literally means patience, though it is commonly defined stealth. While many teach Nimpo as an art in itself, it has
for years been a central tenet of spiritual development. The idea is that any true growth or development takes
patience, there are many special skills which are normally developed through this principle. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE="-1">The last principle, Shuho, is an ancient one which can be traced back into Japanese and Okinawan antiquity. In the
common Japanese tongue, it is pronounced Tori and the Okinawan dialect tends to be expressed either Tui or Toi.
It refers to the concept of taking, though at it's deeper level it infers the idea of intuitive feeling, though this is little
talked about outside of Okinawa. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE="-1">In Kiyojute Ryu Kempo Bugei, these six principles are explored in depth in the auxiliary martial arts which were
derived from the spread of Kempo throughout the Orient. There are three specific branches, the first is Kobujutsu
which deals with weaponry of both Japan and Okinawa. Among the weapons taught are: Katana, Wakizashi, Bo,
Jo, Sai, Kama, Manrikigusari, Nunchaku, Naginata and Yari. Along with the weaponry, are certain auxiliary arts
which were believed essential in the study of Bugei, though they are not necessarily fighting skills in and of
themselves. Some of these skills studied by Kiyojute Ryu Kempoka are: Karumijutsu, the body lightening art;
Hichojutsu, the leaping/flying art; Koppo, the bone breaking art; Suieijutsu, the swimming art; Haragei, the spirit
art; and there are many others. The weaponry art is referred to as Bukiho Kempo Kobujutsu, while the auxiliary
forms of training are called Nimpo Kempo Kobujutsu. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE="-1">The next section is that of Jujutsu, in which the typical grappling skills of the Ashigaru are practiced. These are the
skills which formed the foundation of Kodokan Judo, in the old days of it being a true martial art with excellent
self defense and combat skills. The second part of the Jujutsu section deals with Aiki, which was the fighting art of
the Bushi who fought in full, heavy armor. The Aiki skills were designed to attack the joints of the arm primarily,
thus we see the wrist locks, elbow extensions and shoulder twists. There was also a division of armor clashing
techniques, where a Bushi would unbalance their opponent and then slam their armor into them to knock them
down, these included the throws known today as: Kokyunage, Irminage and Tenchinage. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE="-1">Karate forms the next section of study. There are two distinct versions: one is the Karate based primarily on
Chinese martial arts, which influenced Okinawan Martial Arts during various periods of history. Starting as early
as the sixth century, during the twelfth century, fourteenth and eighteenth, as well as, nineteenth and twentieth
centuries, there was a strong influx of Chinese based martial arts, including the Shaolin styles, as well as, Tai Chi,
and in modern times, beginning in the late nineteenth and continuing on into the twentieth century, the internal
styles of Pa Kua and Hsing I. White Crane Chuan Fa and especially Hung Chia Chuan Fa, were especially
essential to the development of Okinawan martial arts, giving to the Okinawan art the</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE="-1">five animal techniques and the extreme sophistication of strategy. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE="-1">The second division is based on the Bushi Te, the warrior hand, which was practiced by the royalty of Okinawa.
This art was not only influenced by the Chinese martial arts, but also funded upon the Minamoto Bujutsu brought
to Okinawa by Tametomo Minamoto after the Hogen Incident on Japan, when the Taira defeated Minamoto.
Tametomo and his follower's befriended the Okinawans, marrying and having children. Tametomo's own son,
Shunten, became the first King of Okinawa, using his father's martial arts to establish his rule. It is said the Bushi
Te, martial arts of the royalty was what allowed them to maintain control of the island until the coming of the
Satsuma in 1609, when they were simply, overwhelmingly outnumbered. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE="-1">Bushi Te survived into modern times through the efforts of one man, Choyu Motobu. He wanted to pass his system
of Bushi Te, known specifically as Goten Te, onto his sons, but instead taught the family system to his son's,
Chomo (a.k.a. Toraju), best friend, Seikichi Uehara. He also taught elements to many others through his Okinawan
Karate, Kenkyu Kai, research society. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE="-1">The Chinese influenced Okinawan martial art is preserved through the Goho Kempo Karate of Kiyojute Ryu, while
the principles of Bushi Te are preserved through the art called Shuho Kempo Karate. The term Kempo is used in
each art, since in essence all arts derive from the original martial art of Kempo which formed the foundation of the
concept of fighting arts based on virtue and used to establish and maintain peace. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE="-1">The main and central art of Kiyojute Ryu is known as Shogei Toitsu Kempo. Shogei means 'all arts' and is used to
refer to all the divisions that the martial arts have gone through since their beginning. Toitsu has two meanings, one
common, the other more literal. The common translation is 'unified' while the literal meaning is 'beginning in one'.
Thus Shogei Toitsu Kempo can mean 'all arts unified in one fist law' or 'all arts beginning in one fist law'. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE="-1">Whether looked at as unified or beginning in one, this aspect is most indicative of the Okinawan attitude. Okinawa
had it's own indigenous fighting art, known simply as Te. When Buddhist monks brought to the island their
Chinese Kempo, the Bushi of Okinawa were humble enough to learn everything the could from them, during every
period of time the Chinese influence arrived. And when the Minamoto warriors came to Okinawa, the Okinawan
people welcomed them and once again learned all they could, forming the foundation of their special warrior art. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE="-1">Thus the martial arts of Okinawa are a truly unified system, which encompasses all aspects of combat. The original
martial art of Okinawa encompassed: blocking, striking, throwing, locking, choking, kicking and holding among it's
many empty hand techniques, as well as, weapons of China and Japan, including their own tool weapons, along
with the auxiliary methods of training brought to the island by Chinese monks and Japanese warriors. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE="-1">* * *</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE="-1">Kiyojute Ryu Kempo Bugei seeks to preserve all the elements of the martial arts as practiced by the Samurai of
Japan, prior to the Tokugawa era and the Bushi Te of Okinawa, prior to the modernization of the Okinawan martial
arts in the twentieth century. This is primarily accomplished by maintaining the emphasis on the original form of
Kata, preserving traditional forms of training and practicing in the ancient cooperative manner of the warrior
monks. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE="-1">Kiyojute Ryu Kempo Bugei stands alone as one of the few true combat systems which adheres to the original
principles of the ancient martial arts avoiding the modernization which has created sports out of traditional forms
of combat training. Members of the Ryu belong to a family of like-minded practitioners of the martial arts, united
in the universal love of true Ki development, the goal of any true martial art, seeking enlightenment from the in
depth practice of combat skills. </FONT></P>
