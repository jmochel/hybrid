<H3><A NAME="Warring">The Warring States Period</A></H3>
<P>From the tenth century on, Japan can never be said to have been at peace, but in 1467, the whole country was swept into chaos, in what became known as the Sengoku Jidai (Warring States Period - 1467 C.E. through 1568 C.E.).  This was a time in which all social classes were swept up into war, and feudal domains were sometimes stripped of almost all healthy men, who were either slaughtered in battle, hired themselves out as <I>nobushi </I>(mercenaries), or drafted into armies.</P>
<P>One result of this rampant warfare was that women were often the last defense of towns and castles. In this later period, there are accounts of wives of warlords, dressed in flamboyant armor, leading bands of women armed with <I>naginata</I>. In an account in the <I>Bichi Hyoranki</I>, for example, the wife of Mimura Kotoku, appalled by the mass suicide of the surviving women and children in her husband's besieged castle, armed herself and led 83 soldiers against the enemy, "whirling her <I>naginata</I> like a waterwheel". She challenged a mounted general, Ura Hyobu, but he refused, claiming that women were unfit as opponents to true warriors. He edged backwards in cowardice, saying under his breath that "she is a demon!" She refused to back down, but while his soldiers attacked her, he escaped. She cut through her attackers, and won her way back to the castle.</P>
<P>It was at this time that the image of women fighters with <I>naginata </I>probably arose. However, as Yazawa Isako, a 16th generation headmistress of the Toda-ha Buko Ryu wrote in 1916, the main weapon of most women in these horrible times of war was not the <I>naginata</I>, but the dagger (<I>kaiken). Bushi</I> women carried a <I>kaiken</I> with them at all times. Yazawa states that women were not usually expected to fight with their dagger, but instead, to kill themselves in a manner equally as wrapped in custom as the male warrior's <I>seppuku</I> (cutting the abdomen).  This was known as <I>jigai. </I> In <I>seppuku,</I> a man was required to show his stoicism in the face of unimaginable pain. In <I>jigai</I>, women had a method in which death would occur relatively quickly, and the nature of the wound would not likely cause an ugly distortion of the features or disarrangement of the limbs, thus offending the woman's dignity after death. The dagger was used to cut the jugular vein.</P>
<P>Women did not train in using the <I>kaiken</I> with sophisticated combat techniques. If a women was forced to fight, she was to grab the hilt with both hands, planting the butt firmly against her stomach, and running forward, to stab the enemy with all her weight behind the blade. She was to become, for a moment, a living spear. Thus, she was not supposed to boldly draw her blade and challenge her enemy. She had to find some way to catch him unawares. If she were successful in this, she would most likely be unstoppable. More often than not, however, a woman could not expect to face a single foe, nor even then, to have the advantage of surprise. If she were captured alive, even after killing several enemies, she would be raped, displayed as a captive, or otherwise dishonored . In the rigid beliefs of this period, women would thereby allow shame to attach to their name. In these grim times, the only escape from what was believed to be disgrace was death at one's own hands.</P>
<H3><A NAME="Edo">The Edo Period: An Enforced Peace</A></H3>
<P>In the mid-seventeen century, when Japan finally arrived at an enforced peace under the authoritarian rule of the Tokugawa shogunate , the need for skill at arms decreased. The turbulent energies of the warrior class were bound up in an intricate code of conduct, based on laws governing behavior appropriate to each level of society. The rough codes of warriors were organized into the doctrines (for there was not simply one) of <I>bushido </I>- the "way of the warrior." Self-sacrifice, honor and loyalty became fixed ideals, focusing the warrior class on a new role as governing bureaucrats and police agents of a society at enforced, totalitarian peace. The role of the warrior was mythologized, and certain images held up as ideals for all to emulate.</P>
<P>All women, not only those of the samurai class, became increasingly restricted in the Edo period (1603-1867). Everyone had to fill an immutable role in society, fixed at birth and held until 
death. The rules and social conventions governing conduct between men and women, formerly much more egalitarian, became more rigid than any other period of Japanese history.  A woman's relationship towards her husband was said to mirror that of a <I>samurai</I> towards his lord. The <I>bushi</I> woman was expected to center her life in her home, serving her family, in the person of her husband first, his male sons second, and her mother-in-law third.  Studies and strong physical activity were considered unseemly. Work was almost completely gender divided, and men and women became increasingly separate from one another. There was usually a room in each house reserved for men which women were forbidden to enter, even to clean or serve food. Husbands and wives did not customarily even sleep together. The husband would visit his wife to initiate any sexual activity and afterwards would retire to his own room.</P>
<P>The stories of women warriors defending their homes and their families became means to this end. Women trained with the <I>naginata</I> less for the purpose of combat than to instill them with 
the idealized virtues necessary to be a <I>samurai</I> wife. Women's work was unremitting in serving the males of the household and in trying to teach proper behavior to her children, who were legally considered to be her husband's alone. However, unlike the women of Victorian England, who were expected to be subservient and frail, the <I>bushi</I> women were expected to be subservient and strong. Their duty was to endure. When a <I>bushi</I> woman married, one of the possessions which she took to her husband's home was a <I>naginata</I>. Like the <I>daisho </I>(long and short swords) which her husband bore, the <I>naginata</I> was considered an emblem of her role in society. Practice with the <I>naginata</I> was a means of merging with a spirit of self-sacrifice, of connecting with the hallowed ideals of the warrior class. As men were expected to sacrifice themselves for the state and the maintenance of society, women were expected to sacrifice themselves to a rigid, limited life in the <A NAME="footfour">home</A>.<SUP><A HREF="wwjnotes.html#endfour">4</A></SUP></P>
<P>This was the major role of the <I>naginata</I> throughout most of the Edo period .  No longer carried on the battlefield, or used in civil police <A NAME="footfive">functions</A>,<SUP><A HREF="wwjnotes.html#endfive">5</A></SUP> the use of the <I>naginata</I> was confined to practice with wooden replicas in the many martial traditions <I>(ryu-ha)</I>.</P>
<P>In the mostly peaceful years of Edo period, these martial systems often fissioned. New group often tended to specialize in one or another weapon. In this period, many schools focusing on the use of the <I>naginata</I> were created, and many of these became to be increasingly associated with women.</P>
<P>In some villages, women maintained an activist role in maintaining order. One of my instructor's mother told how when she was a small girl in a village in Kyushu, the southernmost major island of Japan, men were often gone from the village in certain seasons to join up on labor crews. When there was a disturbance at night, or a suspicious character entered the village, the women would grab their <I>naginata</I>, hanging ready on one of the walls of the house, and go running outside to gather and search the town for any danger. Her grandmother was the leader of this "emergency response squad," and they were a naturally autonomous group within the village. Protecting the neighborhood was simply assumed to be one of their functions.</P>
