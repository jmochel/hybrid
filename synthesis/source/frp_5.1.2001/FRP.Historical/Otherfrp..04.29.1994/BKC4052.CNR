     I'm also fond of the idea of creating our own game system.  Count me in!

I as much as I liked the symmetry of the attributes posted by Guy T.
(TELLEFSENGW%HIRAMB.BITNET), I'm afraid I may have to break it down a bit.  I
don't mean this to sound flamish:  I think Guy's done a great service by not
just posting a "we should..."

     I strongly feel that dexterity needs to be broken into fine-motor and
gross-motor.  There is a vast difference between finger dexterity and
large-body movements.  For instance I'm a touch-typist, displaying a good
command of fine-motor control; but I'm hideously un-coordinated for doing
things like dancing (I'm getting better at the large-motor movements from
studing t'ai-ch'i; that's actually where I learned how different my dex is:
I could do the hand movements beautifully, but my balence is pathetic).

     To take that out of the real world and bring in an RPG example:  you
should be able to create a thief who is a fine cut purse (manual dex) but
just average at dodging attacks (graceful-ness?).  You should also be able to
create a programmer who though he's a touch-typist, can't move much better
than your average barn (let's not get into that again!).

     Actually now that I'm thinking about it, you could break Con down as
well into a micro/macro format like dex.  On one hand your reistance to
disesase should be a part of con, but so should mass.  And both are not
directly linked:  you could be massive but very suceptable (sic) to disease,
right?  I can't think of any useful reason to break Strength down to a
micro/macro dicotomy.

     On the Metaphysical attrs, there's something not quite right here but I
can't put my finger on it (pun only margianally intended).  I definately
believe in a Passion attribute and Willpower, but I'm not quite so sure of
Self.  Independence is more the way a character is played than an attribute
and I'd think that the required attribute for leadership would be willpower.
Command would be a test of the leader's will overcoming the will of the
follower/private/etc.  In fact wouldn't independence be a test of your will
over the 'will rating' of the social pressures around you?  Maybe I'm missing
something here, but I can't come up with a single situation where a self
attribute couldn't be replace by a willpower attribute.

     I though for a minute there about making Self a subset of Will (like I
did with dex above), but decided it's not really necessary.  I can't see (but
might be wrong) where someone's resistance to temptation might be a different
vaule than their ability to impose their will on others.  The only difference
I could come up with is likeliness to use the attribute that way (a humble
priest for example might not choose to use his strength-of-will to command
his flock) which didn't strike me as a good enough reason to split them.

     On the other hand what I can find missing in the meta-physical realm is
Empathy.  Empathy is your ability to relate to the emotions and presence of
others.  I'ld geuss that charisma as it's usually used would be greatly
related to empathy.  Empathic people can releate well with others.  I tossed
around the idea of wheither this was covered by Passion but decided it wasn't
because I can imagine both a laid back (low Passion) empath and an energetic
(high passion) empath.

     Optionally, do we want a physical attractiveness rating?  A few players
I know seem to like this kind of attribute.  Maybe charisma could be a value
calculated by Beauty, Empathy, and Passion?

So to frame my proposed changes into Guy's post:

PHYSICAL:
     *Strength
     *Constitution
          -Health
          -Mass
     *Dexterity
          -Manual
          -Grace (There's got to be a better word for this)
     *Beauty (Optional)

MENTAL:
     *Reckoning (I like Reasoning a bit better as a tag here)
     *Knowledge
     *Instinct

METAPHYSICAL
     *Passion
     *Willpower
     *Empathy


Pretty ugly huh?
