Okay, people... after deleting all the header information from the Game Design
posts since Friday, I have almost 700 lines of messages.  Egad.

So bear with me if I have a lot to say in response...

Well, I prefer a Difficulty Roll system, such as that of the Star Wars RPG or
Cyberpunk 2020 (two game I know use it).  Basically, a player rolls some dice
and adds a skill value.  If he meets or exceeds a given Difficulty number, he
succeeds.  Difficulty numbers might be set at Easy:5, Moderate:10,
Difficult:20, Very Difficult:30, or whatever -- depending on the system.

Star Wars skills and attributes are scaled in terms of dice, like 3d6+2,
instead of a flat number.  It's a rather ingenious way to make statistics more
dynamic.

Can't damage be a function of, say, Physical Muscle?  Let me rewrite my
Unification principle:

Unification:  Every attempt should be made to use as few scales as possible,
with the (unattainable?) Holy Grail of Game Design being reduction to a single
scale.  When more than one scale is necessary, the differing scales should be
made either co-dependent, or one scale should be the function of the other.

Well, I have been deliberating over the problems of a good magic system for a
year straight, so I'll post a little summary of my ideas, separately...

Really interesting, but is it playable?  I strive for a game with NO
ARITHMETIC!

Ah, but not all learning is productive.  We learn bad habits, bad procedures,
and the bad learning becomes instinctive, just as good learning often does.  I
truly believe that failures can reduce your chances of further success.

Besides, it's a neat "game" concept...  =)

You're right.  It isn't necessary to describe divine powers in character terms,
but that was just an example of the potential utility of such a "Unified"
system.  Though a GM may never write up stats for Aphrodite, he may need to
write up Helen of Troy.

What I'm saying is that within limits set by the game designer, there should be
varying levels of realism/playability, since not every playing group is alike.
These levels should be scalable.

Dice.  Dice, dice, dice.  Always a problem.  Which dice?  How many?  What
modifiers?  Dice are the unknown factor in every game.  Choice of dice can make
or break any RPG system.

Look at what has worked.  The trend seems to be toward the Difficulty Roll
system.  It's a simple system, very playable.  The only trouble lies in finding
difficulty levels that work consistently at all levels of play.

Yes, it's easy to overdo it.  How many stats is too many?  Eight?  Ten?
Fifteen?  Why not have three groups (Physical, Mental, Social) of five stats
each?  Well, it looks good on paper, but the universe doesn't always fit into
three categories, right?

Well, a Difficulty roll system would handle this very simply.  The Investigator
rolls a d10 and adds his Strength of 5.  Superman rolls a d10 and adds his
Strength of 250,965,750,400,843.2.  If they're arm wrestling or whatever, the
GM simple informs the player of the Investigator that his arm is now a thick
red paste.

Now how do we handle the fractional .2 part of Superman's strength?  =)

As far as I remember, Star Wars has only three scales in the whole game:

	Character scale (5/10/15/20/30 Difficulty Rolls)
	Vehicles scale (same Difficulty scale, but 1D6 on the Character
			scale is 1 point on this scale)
	Character Damage scale (Stunned/Wounded/Incapitated/Dead -- a failed
			roll on the Character scale vs. Strength moves a PC
			up one level on the Damage scale)

I hate "Package Deals."  They rubricize characters, every time.  Pigeonhole,
stereotype.  Surely, the fault lies with the player with no imagination, who
accepts the package whole-heartedly and unconditionally.  But a good game
system should help players make the right choices!

Cyberpunk 2020 has such a system.  You select a Role (class); the Role you
choose places guardrails on your skill choices, but does not prohibit you from
any particular skill choice, other than the accursed Special Abilities.

I still prefer to leave it open.  Why stamp a character from moment of
conception with a stereotype?  Why stamp "Rogue" on a PC?  Why limit what a PC
can learn anyway?

To the Net:

Well, concepts aren't copyrightable (they're patentable).  Only a specific form
of a concept can be copyrighted.  We're largely discussing concepts, and I will
reserve the right to borrow concepts at whim (and I will give due credit, and
probably even ask first) if I publish something.

Since this is a PD net, I suggest to anyone who considers his/her ideas worthy
of publishing to do so!  But not here; until the courts catch up with modern
science, our ideas have little protection here.  Save your best for the printed
page, or be ready to part with them.

Oh, I think this is a FINE place for such a project.  It's a great recruiting
method as well.  I can deal with noise.

Archives?  Talk to the GMAST-L sponsor.

However, I am NOT interested in getting involved in anything as serious as a
capital-P Project.  I can see too much potential for bickering and senseless
deliberation.

Hate to be a party pooper, but can't we just share ideas and have good time?
Do we really need to try to invent the Ultimate RPG?

Email is a LOUSY place to accomplish anything quickly.  It IS what we're stuck
with, so let's not push the medium too far.

Another thing I have a problem with is the idea of the Universal RPG.  I *hate*
the idea of GURPS!  Then again, I have NO URGE to role-play in a variety of
different genres.  I'd be perfectly content with separate systems that handle
FRP and Cyberpunk/SF *well*.

I think the system that covers all genres adequately covers none of them well.

Point of Order!  Let's decide on a system for dice first.  I suggest:

	- Use a difficulty system
	- Keep the numbers small
	- Keep arithmetic to naught
	- Stick with one or two types of dice

No, the last sentence: "the _nucleus_ of a good game system."  That's a REAL,
REACHABLE goal.   Nucleus.  Not completed system for publication and posterity.
Let's be realistic and small.

That way, we have a direction for our discussions.

Aye.  "Arbitrator" sounds like a euphemism for Dictator.  Group Design projects
call for a HUGE amount of maturity, teamwork, and compromise.  Compromise!
That means giving up an idea you REALLY like when three other people don't like
it.

Interesting idea.  Your UD experiences are rather helpful.

Before any large computing project is begun, committees are formed and
guidelines are laid down.  It sounds tedious and time-consuming, but that's
really what we've been doing already.  I wrote the Checklist, and you guys
offered quality criticisms and suggested alterations.  Would someone care to
write a revised Checklist in a less-prosaic form for use for dispute
arbitration?

It really is the first order of business.

If we make certain decisions *in advance* then these problems should not arise.
Being a computer science student, I know the implications and importance of the
Specification/Pre-design stages of any group project.

Questions we MUST address:

1.  What are trying to accomplish?  i.e., What kind of game are we creating?
    (genre? scope?)

2.  What are the separate modules of the game, and how do they interact?
    In CS lingo, what parameters would the various systems "pass" to each
    other?


Guidelines?  We're well on our way to resolving them.  I didn't get a barrage
of flames for my Checklist, so I still suggest using a Revised Checklist for
our Guidelines.

Aaagh!  Reasons are EVERYTHING.  I'm very interested in reasons.

[edited for space:]
>PHYSICAL:	MENTAL:		METAPHYSICAL:
>
>Strength	Reckoning	Passion
>Constitution	Knowledge	Willpower
>Dexterity	Instinct	Self

Well, some comments.  If I never see the words "Strength," "Constitution," or
"Dexterity" again, I'll be a very happy man.  Those old D&D stats have gotten a
little too much publicity, and they're not even good names.

I really liked some of your concepts.  Reckoning, Passion, and Self are really
neat, but I think Passion should be left to the player.

Second, you repeatedly said things like "encompasses ___, ___, and ___."  One
of the points on the Checklist was Basis.


With that in mind, I suggest these attributes (not "abilities"!):

PHYSICAL	MENTAL		SOCIAL

Muscle		Reason		Personality
Coordination	Creativity	Appearance
Health		Instinct	Command
Speed		Willpower	Aura

Explanations -- all attributes comply with the idea of Basis, as far as I feel
	they should go.

Muscle -- pure physical power
Coordination -- grace and hand-eye coordination
Health -- body's ability to repair itself
Speed -- reflex and quickness of muscle

Reason -- logical and mathematical ability
Creativity -- ability to come up with new ideas or combine things in new ways
Instinct -- a perceptual "sixth sense" based on minute details picked up
		by the subconscious
Willpower -- strength of character and mental fortitude

Personality -- charm, "likeability"
Appearance -- attractiveness (body, face, etc.)
Command -- leadership ability
Aura -- emanation of power, ability to command magical forces
