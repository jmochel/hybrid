I agree on your points on structure (well stated), and I'm not trying to
stop work on that, that is already in progress (In fact I think its great).
I just feel that there is another level of abstraction that could be
accomplished.  And that level is what I'm personally interested in.  I've
just been fishing for someone of like mind :-) (Haven't found anyone...:-<

I agree that if talking a genre helps align us in working on the game then
it doesn't hurt (so long as we remember that) and Fantasy is definitely the
right choice.

Well, its obvious the RPG center is around attribute names and the concept
of skills.  And as before thats fine.  I still believe that there is a way
of talking META-ATTRIBUTES or a META-GAME STRUCTURE that could form the
basis of a VERY flexible game that accomodates VERY cool structures like the
one that is being formed by this group.  I just would like to start a
conversation on these points - Not to change the whole direction of the
group.  But because I feel those conversations could shed some light on
the groups efforts, and maybe come up with something very interesting.
Granted I've been evolving how I've been talking about this over time,
but thats ok.  I'm learning!  I guess that by now if I haven't found someone
to discuss this here, I'll mull it over... there!

How true.

Yes and you haven't been cynical, just helpful.  Its bigger than all of us
and there are multiple threads on this on subject.  We can consolidate, but
allow for innovation too.  Every new idea that comes along doesn't have to
be a threat to the direction of the group because it seems to fragment
"the center".  The ideas are rich and some of us are working hard at
consolidation of a set of those ideas and that is good and positive but it
doesn't mean the other ideas should be ignored or invalidated because they
are viewed a threat to the coalesced views of the "center" (Geez, we've got
psychohistory at work here!)  Hey I admit it, I'm on the fringes here.
But somebody has got to do it!  Its my ROLE, my CHARACTER.

Ursus, thanks for the input.
