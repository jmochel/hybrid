Upon further reflection, I realized that the system could scale to
one level more abstract, where each character has only a single stat
and rolls against that for everything, like TWERPS.  The most
abstract version of the character in my example would be:

STAT 11 (roll against for everything)

Converting between this and the next level of abstraction, the STAT
would be the average of the MENTAL and PHYSICAL ratings.

So, there's a system that scales smoothly from TWERPS to GURPS and
beyond in terms of describing characters.

Does anyone else want to handle combat?
