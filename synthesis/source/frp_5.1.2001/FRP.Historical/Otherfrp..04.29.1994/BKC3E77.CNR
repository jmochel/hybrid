     Obviously this suggestion is somewhat useless for those people who hit
this list through non-Bitnet source but for those of us on Bitnet there is the
possiblity of using Relay, the bitnet chat lines, to discuss problems in real
(or at least semi-real) time.  All we would have to do it establish a day and
time that was convenient for all of us and then pick a private channel to
conference on.
     Something that would be really nice to see in a game for a change would be
a system were characters who were ungodly skilled at something or had really
superb attributes had to work to keep those skill/attributes honed to
perfection. This is a point of realism no one seems to get when they make
games. A champion gymnast for instance does not stay anywhere near the top of
his/her form unless they practice at it every day.  A real easy way to simulate
this would be to require people to pay experience points towards stat and skill
upkeep or watch the aforementioned traits steadily erode.  This would also let
your character change as his life changed, the fighter who finds himself
studing to become a mage is going to learn why there are few brawny mages, they
simply haven't the time or energy to devote to it.
     Something else I think you want to be careful of is to never lose sight
that this is a game. If something seems absolutely realistic but is terribly
inelegant throw it away because eventually the number crunching will become
dull and cumbersome.

Catch ya all later
