        Is it really neccesarry to have attributes.  If we are to have a
skill based game why not make it all skills.  As many have pointed out
where do you draw the line in detail between types of atributes (ie how
many attributes are there really.)  To further muddy the waters cannot
attributes be increased through training, just like a skill.  So why
not have attributes listed as skills along with more conventional
skills.  And so, by making a rule that allows for the unskilled to
attempt a "maneuver" you have encompassed all atributes.  For example
a mage may chose not to buy a strength skill, prefering instead the
intelligence skill.  Thus the mage will have difficulty performing an
strength maneuver, but his mental maneuvers will be better (due to his
skill modifications)  Thus a character stars our as a completely blank sheer
skill modifications)  Thus a character stars our as a completely blank sheet
This system seems to lend itself to skill trees.  (ie you bought the strength
skill which modifies your "brawn skill" which in turn modifies your
combat skill etc. on down the line.  Of cource the higher up the tree you
go the more the skill costs.  And there should be many ways to arrive to
a certain skill (ie the combat skill will be modified if you buy the dexterity
skill or if you buy the strength skill)

        I hope the whole system as I am describing it makes sense.  I know
there are weaknesses in this thinking, but I am biased, and have touble
seeing them.. please comment.

EXAMPLE OF SKILL TREE
(ps this is off the cuff, and is merely an illustration)

          LEVEL ONE (highest cost)  STR                 AGILITY
                                   /   \                 /    \
  Level two (2nd higst cost) raw power brawn     quickness     man dex
                              / | \     / \        /    \        /  \

Level 3     etc. (you get the idea)

        The benifit of this system is in my book, once you have a charater
made, there is little figguring during actual play.  It may take time to
get going, but once its up and running it will move fairly quickly
(the same can be said for local BBS's and virgins)
        Anyway.....   Tell me how you feel
        I think that adding a difficulty modifier shoult be simple at this
point for a skill resolution system
