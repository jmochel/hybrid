Well, though the decision hasn't actually been made, I'm assuming we all agree
that we're doing a FRPG.  Since it's fantasy, I think the proper choice of
attribute names sets the mood.  When I saw "Passion," I knew that the attribute
was pointless from a game theory point of view, but it still had a lot of
appeal, just because it sounded so cool for a FRPG.

Your attribute suggestions are good, but have a few flaws.  It seems like
netlag is causing a lot of duplication of effort.


>Fatigue (FT) is a measure of the length of time that a character

>mental exertion.

Why not use Endurance for this?


>Knowledge (KN) is a measure of a person's worldly knowledge and
>his chance to know something he may have heard previously.

I dislike this stat.  Would it increase every time a character learned a new
skill?  Would it continually increase during a character's career, and what
would its upper limit be?  Too many problems; let's leave it out.


>Manipulation (MN) is a measure of a character's ability to
>convince other people to do something that they want them to do.

I much prefer something like Command or Charisma or Leadership.  It is more
direct and simpler (Basis).

The other stats are good, Jason, but there were some holes that some of the
other systems filled.

Okay, you can learn from your mistakes.  However, success and failure are the
most easily measurable occurrences in a RPG, and thus the easiest way to
facilitate a non-XP character advancement system.

By *your* definition.  We, as game designers, must be willing to make room for
the preferences of a large population of players -- many of whom *do* want to
get their warriors strong enough to take on Thor.  Sure, _I_ think it's dumb,
too, but eight years ago I was DMing to players who fought Tiamat.  It was a
lot of fun, though I cringe when I think about it...

This is probably one of the most important concepts we're going to have to
cover before we progress too much further.

I don't like oppositions.  Defining which skills are opposed to which other
skills is a very sticky business, and leaves a lot to opinion.

Also, though the "predisposed mindsets" concept is probably close to the truth,
even modern psychology has difficulty categorizing people.  Short of including
concepts from the Myers-Briggs personality test (I'm a IPFJ, I think...), we'd
better stick to less-"realistic" more-workable systems.

Not necessary, Dave.  Why not a _variation_ of (1)?

I like the idea of prerequisites.  Certain skills require knowledge of other
skills first.  It's easy to implement and track, and it makes sense.

Example -- A PC would have to have Math 5 before he could take Physics 1.

Our definitions are different.  You described what I call a linear probability
system.  In other words, a PC has x chance of doing something, a die is rolled,
and the results are compared.

My definition of a difficulty level system is like this:

A number is assigned for the difficulty of a task.  The player rolls a die and
adds applicable skill and attribute numbers.  The result must exceed the
difficulty in order to succeed.

Difficulty systems are open-ended (non-finite) -- higher numbers can always be
set for harder tasks.  Also, opposing rolls are possible -- two PCs roll;
higher result wins (useful for combat!).  And the normal range of numbers used
in play can be kept small (like 1-30).

Linear probability systems have a lot of disadvantages.  They're closed (1-100
for percentage systems.  And opposing rolls are not easily implemented.

Well, nothing really.  But that list of attributes included Strength,
Dexterity, and Constitution (if I remember right).  I'd hate to spend months
inventing a system only to have some 13-year-old say "You stole the abilities
from D&D."

I liked "Muscle" because it is very, very precise (Basis).

I think everyone agrees that we should differentiate between Agility and Manual
Dexterity.

I think grace and speed/reflex are two very different animals.  I don't even
know how to explain this one; it seems so matter-of-fact to me.

I would separate Reason and Creativity to account for personalities like the
stereotypical Uninventive Mathematician and the Artist-Who-Can't-Add.

Creativity is the base for skills such as Singing, Engineering, and so on.
Also, the spell system I would like to see would allow players to control the
effects of their magical powers instead of using limited spell lists.
Creativity, as well as Reason, should be a part of a caster's abilities.

Still, the two COULD be combined.

Memory is a nice addition, for game-mechanic reasons.  I've seen a lot of games
combine Memory and Perception, but I don't want to do this (Basis).

I wasn't actually referring to sixth sense ESP powers here.  I meant that the
subconscious picks up millions of minute details through the normal five senses
(and the kinetic sense, et al) and can be interpreted as Instinct or
gut-feeling.  Calling it Perception is no problem, and is even preferrable.


>>Personality -- charm, "likeability"
>
>     Why not call it Charm?  Or (dare I use a D&D term??) Charisma?

Okay, Charm it is.  Personality isn't specific enough, I suppose, and the
abbreviation (Per) would interfere with Perception anyway... =)

Very interesting system!  However, it seems to be a bit unwieldy -- even you
quit using the system for skills.

I'd suggest making ever player make a roll against every one of his skills at
the end of each adventure.  The player must FAIL this upkeep roll to keep the
skill at its present level.  If he rolls SUCCESSFULLY, then this would mean
that the skill could not be kept up, and it goes down one point.

Just because time is spent _attempting_ to maintain a skill doesn't mean the
skill doesn't decrease.

Mods could be given to one or two chosen "areas of concentration" so that
bodybuilder PCs would have bonuses towards upkeep.

My system makes higher skills harder to maintain also.

Oh, me too.  But we just insert the following rule:
 "Every time a skill is rolled with a critical success *in the normal course
  of play* the GM *may allow* the player to attempt to improve the skill."

That lets the GM say "Uh-uh, bud, none of that garbage," to players who try to
improve their swordplay skill by swinging at trees.  Also, I'd suggest that
that kind of "fake" training could _lower_ stats, since bad habits could be
learned.

I think you answered your own question.  The concept of Scalability was applied
to attributes.  Your personal preference may be different than some other
player's, so you might want a less detailed group of statistics.

However, I maintain that a scalable attribute system is going to be hell on the
skill system.  We _could_ say "if Health is left out, substitute Endurance
where needed..."




>From: Dave_Wetzel@VOS.STRATUS.COM

[concerning charts:]

Well, Dave, I agree that we can produce a wonderful system without using too
many charts and formulas.  I think that charts are cop-outs.  It's a very
uncreative solution for the problem of "mapping" (math reference, sorry) of
combat onto skills, and skills onto attributes.


>     The second problem is there are far too many skills for it's own good.

In my experiences, I've found that most players LOVE lots of skill choices.
More skills doesn't make the game more complicated to learn, just more
complicated to use.  And you don't _have_ to use all the skills.  PC creation
is my favorite part of playing!

I don't like the idea of spell lists anyway, even for "wizard" magic.  I want
to define a system for GM-adjudication of spell powers.  In other words, the
player says I create such-and-such effect with x damage and y size, and the GM
uses some well-written guidelines and assigns a difficulty (and spell point
cost, if we use such a system).

The player records the spell in his notes for the next time.  It becomes part
of his repertoire of spells he has cast before, so it doesn't take as long to
cast the next time...

As for clerical magic, why treat clerics different from mages?  We just put
constraints on the domains of effects that they can influence, or make the
source of their power be different (if a spell point system is used).

Oh, by the way... it's DEITY, not diety.  From Latin "deus/dei" meaning god.
Just a pet peeve...  =)

Your "faith score" ideas have a lot of merit, but I don't think it's time to
look into that yet, since it doesn't influence the attribute/skill system.
