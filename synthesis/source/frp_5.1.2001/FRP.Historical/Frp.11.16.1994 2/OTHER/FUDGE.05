====================

4.7  Damage and Healing
-----------------------

Two damage-tracking systems are presented here for use by the GM:
Subjective Damage system and Objective Damage system.  The Subjective
system is simpler than the other, but less defined.

In each system, damage to a character can be described as being at one
of six stages of severity.  The stages are:

Just A Scratch: no real game effect, except to create tension.  In the
   Objective system, this will lead to being hurt if the character is
   hit again.  (This effect is optional in the Subjective system.)

Hurt: the character is wounded enough to slow him down a little: -1 to
   all traits which would logically be affected.

Very Hurt: the character is severely wounded, possibly stumbling: -2
   to all traits which would logically be affected.

Incapacitated: the character is so badly wounded as to be incapable of
   any actions, except possibly dragging himself a few feet every now
   and then and gasping out an important message.  Make a roll against
   some sort of Constitution attribute at Fair Difficulty Level to
   stay conscious.  A very lenient GM might allow an Incapacitated
   character to perform such elaborate actions as opening a door or
   grabbing a gem. . .

Near Death: the character is not only unconscious, he'll die in less
   than an hour - maybe a *lot* less - without outside medical help.
   No one recovers from Near Death on their own.

Dead: he has no more use for his possessions; may as well help
   yourself.

Of course, the GM may expand these stages, inserting other levels as
needed.  For example, instead of Hurt and Very Hurt, a GM might use
Lightly Wounded, Wounded, Badly Wounded, Severely Wounded, etc.

The GM may allow a high Difficulty Level Will roll to reduce or even
nullify penalties listed at Hurt, Very Hurt, and possibly even
Incapacitated.

Some players take delight in describing their wounds in detail, even
writing such scars into the character story!

Automatic Death: sometimes you don't have to roll the dice: holding a
knife to a helpless character's throat is a good example - no roll
needed to kill such a character, but your Karma suffers.

4.71  Subjective Damage System
------------------------------

When using FUDGE's Subjective Damage System, the GM considers all of
the factors below (possibly writing them down, the better to weigh
them), and then simply announces how hurt the defender is, using one
of the stages listed above.

1) The relative degree the attack succeeded by - the better the hit,
   the more likelihood of damage.  Winning a combat round with a
   relative degree of +1 means you just hit her somewhere, probably
   where she's most heavily armored.  Scoring a hit with a +3,
   however, means you may have found a chink in the armor.

2) The defender's armor.  People wearing thicker armor, and more of
   it, tend to get hurt less than those wearing no armor.  Armor can
   be finely defined, or simply said to be Light, Medium, or Heavy
   armor.  Science fiction scenarios might have Extra-Heavy armor.
   Fantasy campaigns may include magic armor that offers even greater
   protection, sometimes specific against certain types of damage.

3) The deadliness of the attacker's weapon.  Big weapons tend to do
   more damage than little weapons; sharp weapons rip tissue more than
   dull ones.  People trained in Karate tend to do more damage than
   those untrained in any martial art.

4) The strength of the blow.  For muscle-powered weapons, such as
   melee weapons, unarmed attacks, bows, slings, etc., this is
   determined by the attacker's Strength attribute: stronger folks
   tend to hit harder.  For things like guns, beam weapons, etc., it
   is relative to the nature of the weapon: a .38 usually does more
   damage than a .22.

5) The amount of damage the victim can soak up (Robustness, Damage
   Capacity, or Mass).  Big, healthy guys can take more damage before
   collapsing than little, sickly guys, usually.  But it's your call
   if it's a big, sickly fighter against a little, healthy fellow.

4.72  Objective Damage System
-----------------------------

This system quantifies damage more than the other, and is quite
mechanical.  Damage consists of three parts: Basic Damage, the
attacker's Offensive Damage Modifier, and the defender's Defensive
Damage Modifier.  (There is a fourth optional part: the damage roll.)

Thus:

Total Damage = Basic Damage + Offensive Damage Modifier - Defensive
               Damage Modifier (+ damage roll)

Basic Damage is the relative degree by which the winner hit the loser.
Example: if Lisa rolls a Great combat result and Joe only a Fair
result, Lisa has hit Joe for two points of Basic Damage.

The Offensive Damage Modifier is based on a number of factors,
including strength, Scale and weapon.  For ease of use, it should be
calculated for each weapon at character creation and updated as
necessary.  The Offensive Damage Modifier consists of:

For Muscle-Powered Weapon:
   -1 for no weapon, Martial Art skill at Mediocre or worse (or none).
   +0 for small weapon (knife, blackjack, brass knuckles, sling,
      etc.).
   +0 Martial Art skill at Fair or Good, no weapon.
   +1 Martial Art skill at Great or Superb, no weapon.
   +1 for just-below-average sized weapons (billy club, machete,
      shortsword, epee, hatchet, rock, etc.).
   +2 for average-sized weapon (most swords, axe, spear, large club,
      bow, etc.).
   +3 for large weapon (polearm, two-handed sword, battleaxe, etc.).
   +1 for sharpness (add to other weapon damage: knife becomes +1,
      shortsword +2, broadsword +3, greatsword +4, etc.).
   
   Note: For a less lethal game, subtract 1 from each type of weapon
   except sharpness.  (Note that this will lengthen combats.)

For Character's Strength (muscle-powered weapons only):
   +3 for Superb Strength
   +2 for Great Strength
   +1 for Good Strength
   +0 for Fair Strength
   -1 for Mediocre Strength
   -2 for Poor Strength
   -3 for Terrible Strength

For Weapon's Strength (Guns, Crossbows, Beam weapons, etc.,):
   +/- Strength of weapon (see Section 4.65, Objective Ranged Combat).

For Attacker's Scale:
   Plus the attacker's Strength Scale (see Section 4.75).
   
   Note: the attacker's Strength Scale is relevant only for muscle-
   powered weapons and for those projectile weapons scaled to the
   attacker's size, such as miniature bazookas or giant-sized
   handguns.  A superhero of Scale 10 using an ordinary pistol would
   *not* figure his Scale into the Offensive Damage Modifier.

Example of Offensive Damage Modifier: Jeb the Dwarf is of Scale 1
(although short, he's solid as a rock), Great Strength (+2), and uses
a one-handed axe of +3 damage.  On his character sheet, Jeb would
have: "One-handed Axe, +3 damage (Off.Dam.Mod.: +6)."

The Defensive Damage Modifier is based on armor and Scale (Mass) and
should likewise be calculated at character creation and updated as the
character's armor changes.  The Defensive Damage Modifier consists of:

For Armor:
   +1 or +2 for a good shield (add to other armor modifiers).
   +1 for light, pliable non-metal armor.
   +2 for heavy, rigid non-metal armor
   +2 for light metal armor.
   +3 for medium metal armor.
   +4 for heavy metal armor.
   +5 or more for science fiction advanced armor.

Note: a +2 shield is *very* large and cumbersome to carry.
Note: magical armor may add anywhere from +1 to whatever the GM will
      allow to any given armor type above.

For Defender's Mass Scale:
   Plus the defender's Mass Scale (see Section 4.75).
   
   (If the defender has Mass other than Fair, or a gift of Tough Hide,
    it should also be figured in.)

Example of Defensive Damage Modifier: Jeb the Dwarf is of Scale +1,
and wears heavy non-metal armor (+2) and carries a regular shield
(+1).  On the character sheet, the player would list: "Shield: +1; Hvy
non-metal armor: +2 (Def.Dam.Mod: +3 w/out shield; +4 w/shield)."

Optional Damage Roll:
   
   Although the damage roll is optional, it is recommended.  For one
   thing, it allows a character with a high Offensive Damage Modifier
   merely to graze an opponent, something the Objective Damage system
   doesn't account for otherwise.  Further, it gives a tiny fighter a
   chance to damage a large opponent - a small chance, true, but
   that's better than no chance.

First, make all calculations above; the damage at this point is called
the *calculated* damage.  The attacker then makes a Situational damage
roll, which is not based on any trait.  The result, which will range
from -4 to +4, is applied to the calculated damage to produce the
final damage.  Negative final damage is treated as zero damage.

There are three limitations to the damage roll:
1) If the calculated damage is positive, the damage roll cannot exceed
   the calculated damage.  For example, if the calculated damage is
   two, any damage roll of +3 or +4 is reduced to +2.
2) If the calculated damage is positive, the final damage cannot be
   less than one.
3) If the calculated damage is negative or zero, the final damage may
   be raised to a maximum of one point by a damage roll.

First Example: The calculated damage is found to be -2 due to armor
and Scale.  It would take a +3 or +4 result to inflict a wound on the
defender in this case, and then only 1 point of damage.

Second Example: The calculated damage is +2.  A damage roll of +2 to
+4 results in final damage of four points, since calculated damage
cannot be more than doubled by a damage roll.  A damage roll of +1
results in final damage of three points, while a damage roll of 0
results in two points of final damage.  Any negative die roll results
in one point of final damage, since a positive calculated damage
cannot be reduced below one by a damage roll.

For simplicity, of course, the GM can simply ignore the limitations,
and allow the damage roll to be anywhere from -4 to +4, let the chips
fall where they may . . .

Grazing:

A simple way to represent grazes in combat is to say that any Basic
Damage of +1 (Opposed action won by 1) can do at most 1 point of
damage, plus any Scale difference.  (It may do zero points, of course,
depending on the opponent's Defensive Damage Modifier.)  This grazing
could be a maximum of two points (plus difference in Scale), if the GM
desired.  Or the Scale difference could be halved in this case,
meaning a giant's club could still give a human a glancing blow that
would probably Hurt, but not necessarily Incapacitate.

Recording wounds:

Once the final damage is determined, it is recorded on the wounded
fighter's character sheet.  The Scratched, Hurt, Very Hurt, etc.,
system introduced in Section 4.7, Damage and Healing, is used.
However, each point of damage does not necessarily mean the wounded
character loses the same number of steps.  Instead, the different
levels of Damage Capacity take hits as follows:

              Scratch  Hurt  Very Hurt  Incapacitated  Near Death
Terrible         1       1       1           1              2
Poor             2       1       1           2              2
Mediocre         2       2       1           2              2
Fair             2       2       2           2              2
Good             3       2       2           3              2
Great            3       3       2           3              2
Superb           3       3       3           3              2
Legendary        4       3       3           4              2

Wounds are cumulative.  That is, the first two points of damage to a
character with Fair Damage Capacity count as Scratches, and the next
hit will Hurt the character.  The fifth point of damage will make the
character Very Hurt, and so on, until the eleventh point of damage,
which will kill the character.  If this character has taken four
points of damage total, he is still only at -1 to his actions for
being Hurt; he is not at -2 until the next point of damage, which will
make him Very Hurt.

The player should write the character's wound progression on the
character sheet at character creation if using the Objective Damage
System.

The wound progression above makes for a fairly realistic campaign.
For a more cinematic campaign (especially those without magic or
science fiction healing), add an extra Scratch (and maybe even Hurt)
to each level.  It wouldn't be out of line, for an epic scale game, to
add 2 levels of Scratch and Hurt to each PC.  This would mean little
blows wouldn't accumulate so quickly to hinder the character.

4.73  Damage Threshold
----------------------

A "damage threshold" is a limit to the number of wound steps a
character can take in one blow.  This is an optional rule, recommended
for campaigns that are even the least bit heroic.  A damage threshold
prevents accidental PC death, which (in most campaigns) shouldn't
occur through a bad die roll, but only if the character's actions were
truly self-sacrificing or stupid enough to warrant death.  The damage
threshold concept can be implemented in different ways.

One method is simply to rule that an average character cannot take
more than three levels of wounds in one blow *in ordinary combat.*
For example, an unwounded character could be Scratched, Hurt, or Very
Hurt in one blow, but any excess damage points beyond that would be
lost.  A Hurt character could go all the way to Near Death in one
blow, but not be killed outright.

The GM might tailor the damage threshold to Damage Capacity.  For
example, characters of Great or Superb Damage Capacity might take only
two levels of wounds in one blow.  (That is, an unwounded character of
Superb Damage Capacity can only be Scratched or Hurt, not Very Hurt,
in his first wound.)  Likewise, characters of Terrible and Poor Damage
Capacity might be able to go through four wound levels in one blow.

Another way to handle a damage threshold is to say that a character
cannot be rendered Incapacitated unless he began that combat round
Very Hurt.  This type of threshold could be between Incapacitated and
Near Death, instead - or both, if desired!  This is simpler to keep
track of than the other system, but even less realistic.  But, then,
the whole concept of a damage threshold isn't realistic: it's to make
the PCs more heroic than real life.

The "automatic death" rule in Section 4.7, Damage and Healing, takes
precedence over damage thresholds.  Note that "automatic death" can be
defined by the GM to include such things as being hit solidly by a
giant, which doesn't really fall under the category of "ordinary
combat."  Being shot by a large firearm actually can be considered
ordinary combat, but might be exempt from the damage threshold rule,
anyway.

An indulgent GM who isn't concerned with realism can use damage
thresholds for PCs but ignore them for NPCs.

Perhaps the simplest and best way to prevent unnecessary PC death is
to allow a player to spend a Fudge Point (Section 2.36) to convert a
deadly wound to a merely serious one.

4.74  Combat and Objective Damage Example
-----------------------------------------

This example uses the Objective Damage system, including the optional
damage roll.

The two opponents are Medieval warriors, Snorri and Brynhild.  The
fight takes place in a barroom, which quickly emptied of other
occupants once weapons were drawn.  No one noticed that the
innkeeper's son had actually left much earlier than this, when the
belligerent Snorri was merely exchanging insults with the proud
Brynhild.  Both fighters are human (Scale 0), so Scale is left out of
the discussion.

Snorri:
Strength: Good (+1)
Weapon: Magic Sword (+2 for size, +1 for Sharpness, +1 for Magic = +4)
Sword skill: Great
Damage Capacity: Good
Armor: Heavy Leather (+2), no shield
Offensive Damage Modifier: +5
Defensive Damage Modifier: +2

Brynhild:
Strength: Great (+2)
Weapon: Axe (+2 for size, +1 for Sharpness = +3)
Axe skill: Good
Damage Capacity: Fair
Armor: Heavy Leather (+2)
Shield: Normal (+1)
Offensive Damage Modifier: (+5)
Defensive Damage Modifier: (+3)

In the first round, Snorri gets a Great result on his weapon skill,
and Brynhild gets a Fair result.  Snorri wins with a relative degree
of +2, which equals the Basic Damage.  Next, Snorri's Offensive Damage
Modifier of +5 is added in, bringing the damage to +7.  Now the GM
subtracts Brynhild's Defensive Damage Modifier of +3, bringing the
calculated damage down to +4.
   
   The GM is requiring damage rolls, so Snorri's player rolls the
   dice: a -4 result, the worst he could have gotten!  This would
   bring the damage down to 0, but there is a limitation that prevents
   positive calculated damage to be reduced below one, so Snorri does
   one point of damage to Brynhild.
   
   Since her Damage Capacity is Fair, Brynhild can take two points of
   damage and still be only Scratched.  The GM marks one point of
   Scratch, and the next round is fought.

In the second round, both combatants get Good results - a standoff.
The GM describes it as a give-and-take of blows that are all parried
or blocked as the fighters circle each other.

In the third round, Snorri gets a Great result and Brynhild only a
Good result - Snorri has hit again!  Basic Damage = 1, his Offensive
Damage Modifier of +5 brings damage up to 6, and Brynhild's Defensive
Damage Modifier of +3 brings the calculated damage to +3.  Snorri's
player rolls the dice, this time getting a +1 result: he scores four
points of damage to Brynhild!
   
   The GM marks off four points of damage on Brynhild's character
   sheet: one uses up the last Scratch, the next two use up both Hurt
   points, and the last damage point is marked against Very Hurt.
   Brynhild is now Very Hurt, and her skill is at -2: she's fighting
   as if she were Mediocre now.

In the fourth round, Snorri decides to finish off the wounded Brynhild
in one blow: he all-out attacks, which gives him a +1 to his skill,
and a +1 to damage if he wins.  Brynhild had decided to try for a
situational advantage, though: she's spending this round in all-out
defense, hoping to spot some way to get an advantage over Snorri for
the fifth round.  Brynhild gets +2 to her skill this turn, but can't
hurt Snorri if she wins.  Snorri gets a Great result, even with his +1
for all-out attacking, and Brynhild also gets a Great result!  Snorri
would ordinarily have lost the combat round (all-out attackers lose
tie results), but Brynhild's all-out defense means she doesn't aim any
blows at Snorri, just beats his attack down.

In the fifth round, the GM gives Brynhild a much-needed +1 for having
spotted a spilled drink on the barroom floor.  Since she didn't lose
the previous round, she managed to maneuver Snorri so that he's in the
puddle: he's at -1 to skill this round (down to Good).  Snorri takes
an ordinary combat round, and Brynhild, wounded and desperate, now
tries an all-out attack herself: +1 to her skill, bringing her up to
an effective skill of Fair from her wounded Mediocre state.  Brynhild
rolls a Great result, and Snorri only gets a Good result: Brynhild
wins this round.
   
   Since she was doing an all-out attack, she gets a bonus of +1 to
   damage.  The Basic Damage is therefore 2, which becomes 7 when her
   Offensive Damage Modifier is added in.  Snorri's Defensive Damage
   Modifier is +2, so calculated damage is 5.  The GM makes a damage
   roll of +0, so Snorri takes five points of damage.  Since his
   Damage Capacity is Good, this means three of the damage points are
   Scratches, and the final two are Hurt wounds.  Snorri is now Hurt:
   -1 until healed.

The combat is interrupted at this point by the town guards, who had
been quickly alerted by the innkeeper's son.  Snorri and Brynhild are
hauled off to separate cells, probably only too glad to get out of
what had become a deadly duel . . .

4.75  Non-human Scale in Combat
-------------------------------

Combat between creatures of different Scale (Mass/Strength Scale) is
very straightforward.  Because weapons and armor are scaled along with
the wielder's Strength, no difficult computation is needed.

Basically, the attacker's Strength Scale is figured into his Offensive
Damage Modifier, and the defender's Mass Scale is figured into her
Defensive Damage Modifier.  Once the basic damage has been determined
normally, the attacker's Offensive Damage Modifier is added to his
damage, and the defender's Defensive Damage Modifier is subtracted
from the final damage.  If you have combat with beings weaker than
humans, remember what you learned in school about adding and
subtracting negative numbers . . .

That's all there is to it.  As per normal FUDGE damage rules, armor
decreases the damage done while weapon size and deadliness may
increase the damage done.  Hits become Scratches, Hurt, etc., as usual
- see Section 4.7, Damage and Healing.

However, a very small character is not likely to be able to wound a
large one in this system.  The GM may allow a point or two of damage
to penetrate if the small character gets a critical success.  Poison-
tipped arrows and lances are also a possibility: the small character
can aim for joints in the armor and merely has to break the skin to
inject the poison.

Also, this system treats Scale like armor, which isn't quite accurate.
In reality, a small opponent may be slowly carving the larger fighter
up, but each wound is too petty, relative to the large scale, to do
much damage by itself.  To reflect a lot of small wounds gradually
inflicting a hit on a large-scale foe, let each hit that is just
barely stopped by Scale count as half a hit.  "Just barely" depends on
the Scale difference, of course.  For Scale 1, there isn't any half
hit stage, while Scale 10 difference might mean having six or more
hits stopped by scale.

Another way to represent this is to allow a damage roll when Scale
prevents a hit from doing any damage.  See Section 4.72, Objective
Damage System, for damage rolls.

There are also "scale piercing" weapons, such as whale harpoons and
elephant guns.  These don't have massive damage numbers: instead, if
they hit well, simply halve the Scale value, or ignore it all
together.  Of course, if such a weapon is used on a human, it would
indeed have a massive damage modifier . . .

Objective Damage System Combat Examples: In the following examples,
Strength and Mass are at the same Scale.  Also, it is assumed the GM
is not using the optional damage roll, which could vary damage in all
three combat rounds discussed.

First example:

Wilbur, a human knight with a sword, is attacking a dragon.  Wilbur's
Offensive Damage Modifier is a respectable +6:
   Great Strength: +2
   Two-handed sword: +4 (+3 for size, +1 for sharpness)
   Scale: +0.
The dragon's Defensive Damage Modifier is +8:
   Scale: +6
   Tough hide: +2.
If Wilbur hits the dragon with a relative degree of +3, he does 3+6 =
9 points of damage.  This would be a very severe blow to a human (even
one wearing armor), but this is no human opponent.  Only one hit gets
through after subtracting the dragon's Defensive Damage Modifier of 8.
The GM checks off a Scratch for the dragon, and the fight continues.
Since the dragon has Fair Damage Capacity (she can take two
Scratches), Wilbur will have to do this twice more before he finally
Hurts the dragon.  He may need help, or have to go back for his magic
sword!

Second example:

Sheba, a human warrior, has just kicked McMurtree, a wee leprechaun.
Sheba's Offensive Damage Modifier = +1:
   Fair Strength: +0
   Great Unarmed Combat Skill: +1
   Scale: +0.
McMurtree's Defensive Damage Modifier is -3:
   Light Leather Armor: +1
   Scale: -4.
If Sheba wins the first combat round with a relative degree of +1 she
adds in her Offensive Damage Modifier of +1 for a total damage so far
of +2.  However, McMurtree's Defensive Damage Modifier equals -3,
which is subtracted from the damage.  Subtracting a negative number
means you actually add an equal but positive amount: 2+3 = 5 points of
damage.  Since he has Fair Damage Capacity, he takes 2 Scratch hits, 2
Hurt hits and 1 Very Hurt hit - he's at -2 for the next combat round,
and in grave danger if she hits again.

Third example:

McMurtree's friend, Fionn, now swings his shillelagh (oak root club)
at Sheba's knee.  Fionn's Offensive Damage Modifier is -1:
   Good Strength: +1
   Shillelagh: +2 (medium sized relative to Fionn, not sharp)
   Scale: -4.
Sheba's Defensive Damage Modifier is +2:
   Heavy Leather Armor: +2
   Scale: +0.
If Fionn wins by +3, he adds in his Offensive Damage Modifier of -1,
which brings the damage down to a total so far of +2.  Unfortunately
for Fionn, this equals Sheba's Defensive Damage Modifier exactly, so
she takes no damage from an excellently placed hit!

Fionn had better think of some other strategy, quickly.  Fortunately
for Fionn, he knows some magic, and if he can dodge just one kick from
Sheba, she'll learn the hard way why it's best not to antagonize the
Wee folk . . .

4.76  Pulling Punches & Knockout Damage
---------------------------------------

In either the Objective or Subjective Damage system, a player can have
his character do reduced damage in any given attack.  This commonly
occurs in duels of honor, where it is only necessary to draw "first
blood" to win, and killing your opponent can get you charged with
murder.  This is known as "pulling your punch," even if you are using
a sword.

To pull your punch, simply announce the maximum damage level you will
do if you are successful.  A fencer can say he is going for one point
of damage, for example.  In this case, even if he wins the Opposed
action by +8, and adds in +3 for his sword, he only does one point of
damage: he was just trying to nick his foe.  In the Subjective Damage
system, a player might decide he just wanted to Scratch the opponent.

Likewise, a player can announce that his character is going for knock-
out damage rather than killing damage.  In this case, Hurt and Very
Hurt simply count as additional Scratch levels.  It takes an
Incapacitated result to knock a character out, but there is no penalty
for being Hurt or Very Hurt on the way.  A knocked-out character
doesn't need healing to recuperate to full health - just time.  (Only
a very severe GM would roll for the possibility of brain damage - this
is fiction, not reality!)

The GM may simply decide that a successful Good blow (or better) to
the head knocks someone out automatically.  In an Opposed action, the
Good blow would also have to win the combat, of course.

4.77  Healing
-------------

Healing is done through a medical skill or supernormal power.  A
Scratch is too insignificant to require a roll on a healing skill
(although it might require a kiss to make it better . . .).  A Good
result on a healing skill heals all Hurt wounds; a Great result heals
all Very Hurt (as well as Hurt) wounds, and a Superb result heals an
Incapacitated character.

Otherwise, wounds heal on their own at one wound level per week of
rest.  That is, after a week of rest, an Incapacitated character
becomes Very Hurt, etc.  (The GM sets the healing rate of Scratches.
They may disappear automatically once you are out of combat time, or
they may linger on for a day or two.)  The GM may also require a
successful roll against some sort of Constitution attribute: Fair
Difficulty Level for Hurt, Good Difficulty Level for Very Hurt, and
Great Difficulty Level for Incapacitated.  Failing this roll slows the
healing process.  Someone Near Death should take a long time to heal,
even with magical or high tech healing.

Healing with realistic medical skills takes time: the success of the
roll merely insures the wounds *will* heal, given enough rest.  How
long this takes depends on the technological level of the game
setting, and is up to the GM.  (A day per treated wound is extremely
fast healing, but may be appropriate in an epic-style game.  Likewise,
one minute per magically healed wound is very fast.)  Whether or not
strenuous activity before the healing period ends reopens a wound is
also left up to the GM . . .

4.8  Critical Results
---------------------

Critical results are an optional FUDGE rule for GMs who like the idea.
A natural rolled result of +4 can be considered a critical success -
the character has done exceptionally well, and the GM may grant some
special bonus to the action.  Likewise, a natural result of -4 is a
critical failure, and the character has done as poorly as he possibly
can in the given situation.

Note that achieving +/-4 with die modifiers does not count as a
critical result, though the character *has* done exceptionally well or
poorly.  When a natural critical result is rolled, the GM may ignore
what the rolled degree would be, and treat it as an automatic beyond
Superb or below Terrible result.

Optionally, if a character gets a rolled degree four or more levels
better than the Difficulty Level, he has gotten a critical success.
Likewise, four levels below a Difficulty Level is a critical failure.

A critical result in combat can mean many things: one fighter falls
down, or drops his weapon, or is hurt extra badly, or is stunned for a
round and can't even defend himself, or is temporarily blinded, or
knocked out, etc.  The GM should be creative, but not kill a character
outright!

The GM may even wish to make a table, such as these sample melee
critical results:

Roll 2d6:
 2   Blinded for the next combat round - no defense or offense!
 3   Fall down: skill at -2 for one round.
 4   Armor badly damaged - no armor value rest of fight!
 5   Weapon finds chink in armor - do not subtract for armor.
 6   Off balance - skill at -1 next turn.
 7   Drop Weapon.
 8   Weapon breaks, but still useful: -1 to damage.
 9   . . .

And so on - finish and customize to your tastes.

This is an easy way to achieve a lot of detail without complicating
FUDGE.  Those with Internet access are invited to add any interesting
critical results tables they create to the FUDGE sites!

4.9  NPC Reactions
------------------

Sometimes a non-player character has a set reaction to the PCs.
Perhaps she's automatically their enemy, or perhaps the party has
rescued her, and earned her gratitude.  But there will be many NPCs
that don't have a set reaction.  When the PCs request information or
aid, it might go smoothly or it might not go well at all.  Negotiation
with a stranger is always an unknown quantity to the players - it may
be so for the GM, too!

When in doubt, the GM should secretly make a Situational roll.  If the
PC in question has a trait that might affect a stranger's reaction,
this should be grant a +/-1 (or more) to the result.  Examples include
Appearance (which could be an attribute, gift or fault), Charisma,
Reputation, Status, and such habits as nose-picking or vulgar
language.  The Reaction roll can also be modified up or down by
circumstances: bribes, suspicious or friendly nature of the NPC,
proximity of the NPC's boss, observed PC behavior, etc.

The higher the Reaction roll result, the better the reaction.  On a
Fair result, for example, the NPC will be mildly helpful, but only if
it's not too much effort.  She won't be helpful at all on Mediocre or
worse results, but will react well on a Good result or better.

Example: Nathaniel needs some information about the local duke, who he
suspects is corrupt.  He has observed that folks are reticent to talk
about the duke to strangers.  Nathaniel decides to approach a
talkative vegetable seller at the open market.  Nathaniel has an
average appearance (no modifier), but is charismatic: +1 to any
Reaction roll.  He makes small talk for a while, then slowly brings
the duke into the conversation.  The GM decides this was done
skillfully enough to warrant another +1 on the reaction roll.
However, the situation is prickly: -2 in general to elicit *any*
information about the sinister local ruler.  This cancels Nathaniel's
bonuses.  The GM rolls in secret, and gets a Fair result.  The old
lady slips out a bit of useful information before realizing what she's
just said.  At that point she clams up, but Nathaniel casually changes
the subject to the weather, dispelling her suspicions.  He wanders off
to try his luck elsewhere.


5  Character Development
========================

After playing a bit, perhaps each session, the player will want the
character to grow in abilities.  At this point, initial GM-set skill
limits (such as one Superb, three Greats) can be exceeded as the
character naturally develops.  There are two ways to handle character
development, or "experience," as it's often called.

5.1  Subjective Character Development
-------------------------------------

When the player feels the character has accomplished enough to warrant
improving in some trait (and he feels he's been roleplaying well), he
petitions the GM for permission to raise it.  A trait can only be
raised one level at a time.  A trait must be used more to raise it
from Good to Great than Fair to Good, and so on.  Also, skill traits
should be much easier to raise than attributes.

Likewise, the GM can simply award an improvement in a trait she feels
deserves to be raised.  In these cases, there is never a corresponding
reduction of another trait - this is character development, not
creation.

5.2  Objective Character Development
------------------------------------

In the Objective Character Development system, the GM can award
experience points (EP), which the player can trade in any way he wants
at the following rates:

Raising a skill up to Fair level: 1 EP per level.
Raising a skill from Fair to Good: 2 EP.
Raising a skill from Good to Great: 4 EP.
Raising a skill from Great to Superb: 8 EP.
Raising a skill from Superb to Legendary: 16 EP (or more), *and* GM
       approval.
Raising a skill from Legendary to Legendary, 2nd Level: 30 EP (or
       more), *and* GM approval.
Raising a skill each level beyond Legendary, 2nd Level: 50 EP (or
       more), *and* GM approval.
Raising an attribute: triple the cost for skills of the same level.
Adding a gift: 6 EP (or more), *and* GM approval.
Adding a supernormal power: 12 EP (or more), *and* GM approval.

However, a trait can only be raised one level at a time.

The GM may adjust these point levels as she sees fit, of course, and
should require that the traits being raised are those that were used
significantly during an adventure.

As a guideline, good roleplaying should be rewarded with 1 to 3 EP per
gaming session, with an upper suggested limit of 4 EP for flawless
roleplaying.  Players may save EP as long as they wish.

Attribute levels may or may not have effect on EPs put into skills.
For simplicity, you can ignore attribute levels entirely when raising
skill levels.  As an interesting way to keep the game more realistic,
however, consider the following options:

High attributes: if a character has an exceptionally high attribute
that would logically affect a skill, then the GM may shift the EP
costs (on the table above) one level cheaper.  For example, raising
Juggling from Fair to Good costs 2 EP for most characters, and raising
it from Good to Great costs 4 EP.  If a character has Great or Superb
Dexterity, however, it would only cost 1 EP to raise Juggling from
Fair to Good, and 2 EP to raise it from Good to Great using this
option.

Low attributes: conversely, an appropriate attribute of Terrible or
Poor would shift the costs one level the other direction.  Raising
Juggling skill from Mediocre to Fair would cost 2 EP if the
character's Dexterity attribute were Terrible, for example.  For an
extreme treatment of this (involving a skill controlling a Supernormal
Power), see Moose the Mage, Section 6.313, Character Examples.

This system is strictly for character development, and is not
recommended for character creation.  If the GM decides to use it,
however, she should warn the players at the time of character creation
so they can plan their characters' attributes accordingly.

A simpler way to handle this is to charge double EP costs (or multiply
EP costs by 1.5, round up) when a skill is raised *above* an
appropriate attribute.  For example, Josco the Jester has Good
Dexterity.  EP costs for raising Juggling skill are normal until he
tries to raise Juggling to Great, which is higher than his Dexterity.
At that point, he must pay double cost: 8 EP.  (Or 6 EP, if using the
x1.5 formula.)  This can quickly become very expensive in terms of EP,
however, especially if the GM hasn't allowed many free attribute
levels.  It is *not* recommended in epic style campaigns, especially
those with Legendary levels!  Again, this would have nothing to do
with skill level costs at character creation, only EP costs.

5.3  Development through Training
---------------------------------

Improving skills through EP is not always realistic, to be honest.  A
gaming session might only cover a few hours of campaign time.
Allowing a character to improve one or two different skills from Fair
to Good in that time is far-fetched, to say the least.  But it's fun
for the players, and psychologically satisfying, and so recommended.

As an alternative, or in addition to the methods described above, the
GM may allow traits to be raised through appropriate amounts of
training time.  This would require finding a teacher (which would cost
money) or taking an appropriate job (which may not be totally
dedicated the skill you wish to learn, and so take longer).  It's also
possible to learn something on your own, but the GM should double the
time required.  If using the Objective Character Development system,
the GM may (or may not) require that EPs be spent in this manner -
that is, you can't spend EPs unless you also take the time to train.

The GM will have to set training time and costs, and difficulty of
finding a teacher.  The teacher has two skills that must be
considered: Teaching skill, and the appropriate skill being taught.
She should also require a number of rolls from the player to see how
diligently the character learned the skill.  These rolls should be on
an attribute such as Willpower, Drive, Zeal, Wisdom, Self Discipline,
Self Motivation, Psyche, Intelligence, etc.  If the player can give a
valid reason why the character is extremely motivated to learn this
skill, the GM may grant up to +2 to the trait tested.  Not every roll
has to match whatever level the GM has set for success, but over half
of them should.

Example: Billy Blaster, space cadet, is back at the Academy after his
first tour of duty.  He decides his Fair Laser pistol skill is not as
good as it needs to be.  He takes a ten-week training course in Laser
pistol use, taught by an instructor of Great Laser skill and Superb
Teaching skill.  (Since Billy has Gift: Employed by Space Patrol, this
is free training for him.)  The GM decides that Billy's player needs
to make five Willpower rolls to see how dedicated he is to studying.
If most of the rolls are Mediocre or better, Billy can raise his Laser
pistol skill from Fair to Good, given the length of training and
quality of the instructor.  Had the training been shorter, or the
instructor worse, he would have needed a preponderance of Fair or even
Good rolls to have successfully raised his Laser pistol skill.

If using this system, remember that it is much easier to improve a
skill from Poor to Mediocre than from Great to Superb.  Require more
time, or higher Difficulty Levels on the Will rolls to raise an
already high skill.
