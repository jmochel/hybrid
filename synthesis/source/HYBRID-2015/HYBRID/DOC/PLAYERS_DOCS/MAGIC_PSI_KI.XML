        <title>Overview</title>
        <para> Many things get done in the fantasy campaign by manipulating energy. And while the
            types of energy Are often completely different from each other the effects often look
            the same So I'm documenting them as one block. To start with there are three major
            groups of energy. <simplelist>
                <member>Magic - the use of magical power to produce results.</member>
                <member>Psi or Mind gifts - The ability to use mental gifts and energies to produce
                    results.</member>
                <member> Ki - the ability to tap and use an inner well of personal energy.</member>
            </simplelist>
        </para>
        <para>Magic Is the ability to manipulate magical power or mana. Spell casters use their own
            internal energies to manipulate Mana. It is not known where Mana comes from, but mana is
            generally all around us, it can flow and pool. The caster uses their own energy to
            raise, focus, and apply mana. The act of raising, focusing and applying energy is called
            spell casting. That spellcasting can be very unstructured all the way up to very
            structured. There are two ways you can view casting.</para>
        <formalpara>
            <title>The water model of magic</title>
            <para> If you view mana as a kind of water then the very unstructured forms of spell
                casting are like scooping the water up in your hands and splashing them at someone
                as opposed to creating dams and dikes and pipes and hoses to deliver the water where
                you want to go. As you go from less structured to more structured it takes less
                energy to achieve the same result while taking more time and often requiring more
                care and detail work. The simplest form of casting are cantrips, which of the
                equivalent of splashing water out of a pool with your hand. They are blazingly
                quick, not particularly effective for anything beyond very small results like
                lighting a candle. The next form is slightly more structured, and it is called
                sorcery. A sorcerer is kind of like a kid with a hand pump who can pull up the water
                and direct it while dynamically changing with the circumstances so that they can
                redirect the water at the drop of a hat. The next level up, Wizardry, is much more
                structured but it does come in a range of complexities from simple structures with
                tightly focused purposes (Squirt guns), to more general Complicated structures
                (household plumbing), all the way up to monumental works (the Hoover dam)</para>
        </formalpara>
        <formalpara>
            <title>The communication model of magic</title>
            <para>You can view spell casting as composing communications out of words. You say the
                word "flame" and a small flame appears (a cantrip). You say the phrase "a flaming
                ball of death is coming your way" and a flaming ball of death is summoned and is
                heading in a specific direction (Sorcery). When it is more complicated requires more
                than words to get the point across (like a business presentation) then we are
                talking wizardries. And most of the tools and extra details that go into wizardry
                are mostly to keep the conversation going when the wizard isn't there. The biggest
                difference between a sorcery and a wizardry Is that a wizardry can continue when the
                saucer is no longer speaking are generating the conversation.</para>
        </formalpara>
        <para>Each type of mana behaves in its own particular way especially when being manipulated
            by the caster or when interacting with each other. Some of these ways are very logical.
            The magical element of water is very effective in combating the magical element of fire.
            The magical element of fire takes more work to control but produces more damage than the
            magical element of air. The magical element of dark is diametrically opposed to the
            magical element of light. There are some energies that human mages can barely get access
            to and even when they are casting with them they are often on the edge of being out of
            control. There are also energies that are so phenomenally dangerous that only the most
            powerful of mages can even attempt to work with them.</para>
        <sect2>
            <title>The Fundamental energies</title>
            <subtitle>The insanely dangerous energies.</subtitle>
            <formalpara>
                <title>Chaos or Wild Magics</title>
                <para>Wild magics are the magic of creation. They are profoundly chaotic, almost
                    impossible to control, and wildly powerful. The world is designed so that the
                    structure of the world prevents easy access to wild magics. Casting with wild
                    magic is very much like a human trying to redirect lightning with their bare
                    hands. They have a name for that type of spellcaster, the name is "fuse".</para>

            <title>The Eternal energies</title>
            <subtitle>The difficult to control but sometimes I can cast with them
                energies</subtitle>
            <para>The eternal energies are a set of energies that are slow to summon, slippery to
                hold, hard to redirect, often difficult to banish and often have lasting effects and
                echoes. In general though they are actually highly ordered and structured that Order
                is rarely apparent to the spellcaster. These energies are known as Belief, Stream,
                and Fabric</para>
            <formalpara>
                <title>Belief</title>
                <para>Belief is the energy of faith. It is very difficult to get a handle on and
                    generally only the gods can reliably use it. This really is the power of
                    miracles. It can be cast and manipulated by mages and is used by priests and
                    priestesses. It despite that there is a fundamental difference between when a
                    mage or priest attempts to manipulate belief and when the divine is present.
                    Don't make the mistake of believing that a priest is simply a mage. A priest is
                    a channel for their deity.</para>
            </formalpara>
            <formalpara>
                <title>Stream</title>
                <para>Stream is the energy of time and possibilities. Like belief is very difficult
                    to get a handle on and generally only the gods can reliably use it. Mages and
                    shamans and others such as oracles can use it in much the same way that humans
                    can ride a rhinoceros. You may be physically able to do it, but you really don't
                    have much ability to control the direction it goes. Someone who is using Stream
                    can see what is happened in the past (Generally much easier than any other type
                    of usage of Stream) as well as get a sense of what may be in the future. In
                    general the foreseeings done with Stream are highly influenced by the mental
                    state of the person doing the seeing. In other words, they often see the types
                    of things they would expect to see.</para>
            </formalpara>
            <formalpara>
                <title>Fabric</title>
                <para>Fabric is the energy of space. Like belief and stream is very difficult to get
                    a handle on and only the gods can reliably use it. But it is relatively easier
                    to control spell castings with Fabric. This is the energy associated with seeing
                    things at a distance (clairvoyance) as well as being associated with the Really
                    cool spells like teleportation.</para>

            <title>The Elemental energies</title>
            <subtitle>The bread-and-butter of most spell casters</subtitle>
            <para>Elemental powers are fairly easy for a spellcaster to get a handle on. The world
                is designed in such a way that mages have relatively easy access to the elemental
                energies. They are generally fast to summon and easy to manipulate and behave
                according to various rules and principles. They have their own kind of order and
                will behave in predictable ways. Elemental energies are less likely to have lasting
                magical effects then the Eternal energies and they can have have fairly lasting
                physical effects.</para>
            <para>Most creatures are actually composed of a balance of the elemental energies in a
                dynamic balance. Too much exposure to any one elemental energy can imbalance an
                individual and make them sick. One of the first things that most spell casters learn
                is how to manipulate the energy without taking it into themselves and thus
                unbalancing themselves.</para>
            <para>The elemental energies are: <simplelist>
                    <member>Fire - Fire is quick to summon hard to control or banish. Losing control
                        usually means something gets scorched. In general fire likes to do damage
                        and consume things.</member>
                    <member>Water - Water is less quick to summon, almost as hard to control as
                        fire, but it is rarely necessary to banish it because you can usually just
                        let it dissipate and run off itself. Water is harder to focus in order to
                        damage.</member>
                    <member>Air - Air is quick to summon and hard to control or banish the losing
                        control rarely involves major damage. Air is very hard to focus in order to
                        damage though it moves quickly</member>
                    <member>Earth - Earth is slow to summon, hard to move, and slow to stop. Once
                        going, Earth can do a great deal of damage</member>
                    <member>Light - Light is quick to summon, easy to move, relatively easy to stop
                        although you do need to do it quickly. In general Light does not tend to do
                        a great deal of damage but it's side effects are often more significant (
                        temporarily blinding someone, distracting someone etc.)</member>
                    <member>Dark - Dark is also quick to summon, easy to move and relatively easy to
                        stop. Like light it does not tend to do a great deal of damage but again its
                        side effects are often significant.</member>
                    <member>Life - Life energies are slightly slower to summon then light and dark,
                        as well as being very hard to focus on something. Life energies are lousy
                        for doing damage with. You can conceivably hit somebody with so much life
                        that they are unbalanced. Life energies are better for certain types of
                        healings and divinations. They are very useful for doing damage to creatures
                        animated by deah such as the undead.</member>
                    <member>Death - Death energies are slightly slower to summon them light and
                        dark, as well as being very hard to focus on something. By the very nature
                        Death energies are useful in injuring living creatures.</member>
                    <member>Shadow - </member>
                    <member>Nature</member>

            <title>The Personal energies</title>
            <subtitle>The its not magic but boy does it look like energies</subtitle>
            <para>The Personal energies are the energies that exist in and around mentating
                creatures. Personal energies are fast to summon (when they come from internal
                sources ). Personal energies are easily manipulated at an intuitive level. Personal
                energies will readily form simple and fragile patterns. Those patterns are disrupted
                by the flow of other energies in the area. Most Personal energies have a personal
                flavor.</para>

        <title>Spellcasting</title>
        <para>There are three steps in casting a spell. The first is gathering the energy, the
            second is focusing that energy and the third is releasing it.</para>
        <sect2>
            <title>Gathering the energy</title>
            <para>Gathering the energy is a fundamental part of the casting process. Most spells
                will use the mage's internal energy to summon and manipulate the specific type of
                energy needed. How well a character can access their own power is governed by their
                PSI stat. Using the power to gather energy expends Mental Fatigue. This MFT can be
                supplemented by energy from Material Components, Magic Items, Living Sacrifice,
                Worship, Physical Exertion, or just by being given the energy by another.</para>
            <para>The skill used in gathering the energy is Manipulate Energy. An ME skill is needed
                for each type of energy to be manipulated. ME: skills such as ME:Fire can be used to
                make perception rolls for detecting the energy in question. A perception skill for a
                specific energy type can be used to determine the intensity and extent of the
                energy.</para>
        </sect2>
        <sect2>
            <title>Focusing the Energy</title>
            <para>In focusing the energy the caster directs and channels the energies toward a
                specific end. Material components used during this part of the spell would be used
                for channeling the energies involved\footnote{ Material Component could be damaged
                (magically) if it cannot contain the energies involved}. Somatic and verbal
                components add to this part of the spell process as does any meditative state or
                trance..</para>
            <para>The mage determines how much energy will be applied at this point. The time taken
                in focusing the energies is spent in setting up the various actions to be performed
                by the energy. The time spent in applying the energy is fairly constant compared to
                the time spent focusing the energies.</para>
        </sect2>
        <sect2>
            <title>Applying Energy</title>
            <para> The energy released should follow the form laid out by the caster when he focused
                on the spell</para>
        </sect2>
    </sect1>
    <sect1>
        <title>Spell types</title>
        <para>Spells vary in their complexity and in the time it takes to cast them. There are
            special names for spell casts of a given complexity and cast time. Those names are Minor
            Magicks, Sorceries, Cantrips, Spells, Rituals and Rites. </para>
        <formalpara>
            <title>Cantrips</title>
            <para>Cantrips are simple magicks. They are simple in structure and low powered. Often
                simple material components will supply the power needed. A caster casting cantrips
                needs to have a skill in Casting:Cantrips in order to be considered ranked in the
                action they are attempting. </para>
        </formalpara>
        <formalpara>
            <title>Sorceries</title>
            <para> Sorceries are castings that have a structure imposed by the caster at the time of
                cast and are generally fairly flexible. </para>
        </formalpara>
        <formalpara>
            <title>Spells</title>
            <para>Spells are ritualized sorceries. They have a structure and effect that are
                determined when they are designed. Thus a caster using a ``Throw Fire'' spell may
                only vary the specific effects of the spell taht are designed to be varied.</para>
        </formalpara>
        <formalpara>
            <title>ritual</title>
            <para>A ritual is a highly structured and detailed spell that involves the manipulation
                of more than one mages worth of energy at a time. In order to do this the caster
                must gather power from some outside source. To cast rituals requires the Hold Energy
                skill for energy type being used. </para>
        </formalpara>
        <formalpara>
            <title>Rites</title>
            <para>A rite is a ritual that requires the work of two or more casters during its
                casting.</para>

        <title>Spell Design</title>
        <para> Spell design consists of isolating the various attributes of the spell such as the
            energies to be used and the actions to be taken and using these attributes to add or
            subtract from a pool of Spell Design Points (SDP).</para>

                <title>Energy Type</title>
                <para>This describes the types of energies to be manipulated. First, there are the
                    Personal Energies: Power and Psi. Both are easy to summon from within or raise
                    via sacrifice. </para>
                <para>Next there are the Eternal energies : Belief, Fabric and Stream. Belief is the
                    energy created by the worship or investment of faith in another entity, being,
                    or object. Stream is the energy derived from the dynamics of the time continua.
                    Fabric is the energy derived from the shifts of equilibrium of seemingly static
                    forces involved in the here and now.</para>
                <para>The Elemental energies are Light, Dark, Fire, Air, Water, Earth, Life,
                    Death.</para>
                <para>The Ephemeral energies are Shadow, Starlight, Nature, Decay, and Lightning.
                    Shadow is the energy produced as a result of the interaction of large amount of
                    light with a small amount of dark. Starlight is the energy produced as a result
                    of the interaction of a large amount of dark with a small amount of light.
                    Nature is the energy produced as a result of the interaction of a large amount
                    of life with a small amount of death. Decay is the energy produced as a result
                    of the interaction of a large amount of Death with a small amount of Life.
                    Lightning is the energy prodiuced by the interaction of Air and Fire</para>

            <title>Factors involved in Focusing Energy</title>
            <sect3>

                <para>This is what the energies are to be used for. These actually spend time during

            <title>Duration (DUR)</title>
            <para>Duration is the length of time that the effect of the spell lasts. An Instaneous
                spell lasts for a very small and fleeting duration. Active Concentration duration
                spells last for as long as the caster concenmtrates on the spell. Any other actions
                the caster may partake of will be considered florentine actions. Passive
                Concentration duration spells last for as long as the caster is concious and or
                clear minded. Permanent spells last until dispelled or disrupted. Spells that have a
                numeric duration buy the scale and value of the duration. By default the scale is in
                pulses and the value is the mage's PSI. <table>

            <title>Example</title>
            <para>A spell is designed by starting with 25 + Mages MST in SDP. All spell statistics
                are 0. CDF = 0, Resistance = 0; DUR = 0; RNG = 0; QE = 0; EC = 0. A {\it Laser}
                spell is designed as follows. We start with the Base spell type. We choose the
                Energy Type of Light. The first action needed is the Summoning of the Light. The
                next action is to transport the Light to the target. After transporting the Light,
                we must apply it to the target in order to damage it. Now let us design another
                spell. We will design a {\it Lightnings Hand} spell. We specify multiple
                targets.</para>

            <para>Investment Rituals are specific to the energy being used. Normally, invested items
                can resist. With sufficient preparation the resistance can be dropped to 0. Warding
