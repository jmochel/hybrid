			"See Jim, See Jim change State"

And you thought the computer industry was a rapidly chganging area.
Well, Magic and Psionic design is even more radidly changing area.
A wonderful field of opportunity for all involved.

Things have become much simpler. I am now convinced that there are
3 things you need to detail out in initial spell design. 

The type of energy involved, the action or actions to be used in the 
spell, and whether a spell is directed at another individual or 
whether it is an area of effect type of spell.

These three factors affect the base Ease Factor of the spell and the
base duration. In addition there are a number of standard defaults 
for initial spell design such as 

CT					defaults to 5 counts
COST				defaults to 4 Mental Fatigue
RESISTANCE			defaults to both Passive and Active Resistance
QUANTITATIVE EFFECT	defaults to some value
NO. OF TARGET TYPES	defaults to all of above
TARGET SIZE			defaults to man size
TYPE OF CAST		defaults to standard spell
MATERIAL COMPONENTS	defaults to none
PREPARATION			defaults to none
RANGE				defaults to Mental Strength (MST)
DRAIN				defaults to standard EF=7

Once a spell has been initially laid out the designer can increase or
decrease the spells value by manipulating the factors and a "Spell 
Point Pool".  

If the designer lengthens the Casting Time then points are added to 
the pool and if he Shortens it points are subtracted from the pool. 

How it all works.
=================

As an example


The fireball spell
------------------

Energy is Fire				: Implies Duration
Action 1 is Summon Fire 	: Affects EF, Affects Duration
Action 2 is Transport Fire	: Affects EF, Affects Duration
Focus is Directed			: Affects EF, Affects Duration

The above things imply the following

CAST TIME			5 counts
COST				4 Mental Fatigue
RESISTANCE			both Passive and Active Resistance
QUANTITATIVE EFFECT	some value
NO. OF TARGET TYPES	all
TARGET SIZE			man size
TYPE OF CAST		standard spell
MATERIAL COMPONENTS	none
PREPARATION			none
RANGE				Mental Strength (MST) in yards or hexes
DRAIN				standard EF=7

Now the designer can modify each of the elements of the spell
and balance it by adding and subtracting from the pool. 

Below are the VERY ROUGH values for adding/subtracting 
points to the pool.

EASE FACTOR (EF)
----------------
	Decrease EF				(EF-n)		+2n
    Increase EF				(EF+n)		-2n

CAST TIME (CT)
---------
	Shorten Cast Time		(CT/n)		-(n-1)
    Lengthen Cast Time		(CT x n)	+(n-1)

COST
----
	Decrease Cost			(Cost/n)	-(n-1)
    Increase Cost			(Cost x n)	+(n-1)

DURATION
--------
	Decrease Duration		(Dur/n)		+(n-1)
    Increase Duration		(Dur x n)	-(n-1)

RESISTANCE
----------
	Passive/Active			+0
    Passive					-1
    Active					-2
	Neither					-3

QUANTITATIVE EFFECT (QE)
-------------------
	Increase				(QE x n)	-(n-1)
    Decrease				(QE/n)		+(n-1)

NO. OF TARGET TYPES
-------------------
	Decrease 				+1/TargetType

TARGET SIZE
-----------
	Smaller Than Man	+2
	Larger Than Man		-2

TYPE OF CAST
------------
	Instinctual Talent	-3
	Talent				-2
	Standard Spell		+0
	Extended Spell		+1
	Ritual				+3


MATERIAL COMPONENTS
-------------------
	Cheap/Common		+1
	Rare/Expensive		+2
	Reusable			+0
	Non-Reusable		+1	

PREPARATION
-----------
	Simple				+0.5
    Short				+0.5
    Complex				+1
    Long				+1


Other Notes that are of interest
--------------------------------

Investment Rituals are specific to the energy being used. Normally,
invested items can resist. With sufficient preparation the 
resistance can be dropped to 0. 

Warding rituals are similiar.

Knowing True Names acts to lower the resistance of the target.
