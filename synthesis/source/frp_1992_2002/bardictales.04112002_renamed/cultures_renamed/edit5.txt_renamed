Koyasan temple in Japan : Koyasan is a mountaintop basin resting over 800 meters 
above sea level and measuring 6km east to west, 3km north to south. The basin is 
surrounded by two concentric rims of hills, each of which is comprised of eight 
peaks. The basin thus resembles the shape of an unfolding lotus flower. The 
marvellously purplish mists that drape the sacred peaks at dawn and dusk present 
a suitably sublime figure
