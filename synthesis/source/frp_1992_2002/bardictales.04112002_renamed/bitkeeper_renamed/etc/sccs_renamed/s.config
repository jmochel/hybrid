# This is the BitKeeper configuration for this package.
# 
# Please take a minute to fill it out carefully, it needs to be accurate.
# 
# NOTICE: you really do want to fill this out, if something goes wrong
# with your repository, or if someone changes the logging policy, we
# send mail to the contact listed here for confirmation.
# 
# BitKeeper can maintain a log of your change comments (not your source,
# just the comments) on a centralized server.  This is useful as your
# project grows, it gives people a place to go see what is happening on
# a per project basis.  This is especially useful for distributed developers.
# 

# 
# Name of the project, such as "BitKeeper" or "The GNU C compiler".

# Open Logging server.  This site is where users go to see the
# ChangeSet comments for all instances of this repository.  This must
# be logging@openlogging.org for usage under the terms of the BKL,
# "bk help bkl" will show you the default licensing terms.  If this
# repository is commercial it can be an internal email address or "none"
# to disable logging.
# 
logging: logging@openlogging.org 
# 
# If this field is set, all checkins will appear to be made by this user,
# in effect making this a single user package.  Single user packages are
# free from the logging constraint.  In order for the package to really
# be free, both the single_user and the single_host field need to be set.

# discovers a problem which requires local intervention.  Please make the

# It is very important that this email address is filled out and accurate.
# If someone converts your repository to open logging (which you may not
# want), we will contact this email address for confirmation that you really
# did want open logging.  If the email address is inaccurate and we get no
# response from anyone else at your location after 90 days, then open logging
# will be implicitly approved.
