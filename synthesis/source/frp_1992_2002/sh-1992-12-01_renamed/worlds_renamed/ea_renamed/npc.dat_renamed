Comment: Shivarra is in many ways a typical Moonsinger. She is sympathetic,     
friendly and ruthless. She has joined with Koreal and Ezra's group because she  
is fond of Finrin and because it allows her to learn more of her enemies.

of hair combs in rosewood and silver.

Comment: Has respect for life insofar as it is a commodity for which people will
exchange money. Spent some time in a local militia before being inducted into   
the Guild.  Believes in no particular power except the presence of death.       
Considers assassination to be the highest of art forms and the most noble of    
callings.  The cleaner the job, the better.  He despises bullies, although he is
not beyond bulling himself if it will suit his ends.  He also believes in law   
and order.  While he appreciates a job done without unnecessary violence, he is 
also cognizant of the value of intimidation.

S SMOKEY EYES AND FIRM JAW; AND THE SWORD AT HIS SIDE AND BLACK SPEAR THAT HE CA
SUALLY LEANS ON ARE WELL CARED FOR AND BEAR MARKS FROM MANY BATTLES.  HERE    ST

Comment: TANWAR IS A GRIM BUT CALM FIGHTER.  HIS FAVORITE TACTIC IS TO GOAD   HI
S FOE INTO A CHARGE WITH HIS BOW, THEN AT THE LAST SECOND SET HIS SPEAR TO    ME
ET IT.  HIS MINIMAL POSSESIONS AND LIGHT ARMOR GIVE HIM A MOVE OF 12" AND HE  WI
LL RUN FROM A FIGHT TO DRAW OFF ATTACKERS OR TO FIND A MORE FAVORABLE         PO
SSITION.  HIS WEAPONS ARE HIS MOST VALUED POSSESIONS AND IF LOSSES THEM HE    WI
LL DEVOTE ALL HIS EFFORTS TO RECOVER THEM.  HE TAKES HIS DUTIES AS A RANGER   VE
RY SERIOUSLY AND WILL USE ALL HIS SKILLS TO KEEP HIS CHARGES FROM HARM.  HE   WI
LL HOWEVER TRY TO CONVINCE ANY ADVENTURERS HE MEETS TO HELP HIM IF HE NEEDS   HE
LP TAKING OUT NASTIES.  HE WILL OFTEN LET SOME OF HIS ATTACKERS GET AWAY AND  TH
EN TRACK THEM BACK TO THEIR LAIR.

Comment: DRAVINOR IS CONSIDERED TO BE ONE OF THE FASTEST RISING YOUNG STARS ON  
THE ASSASSINATION SCENE. HE IS CUNNING AND QUICK WITH A GOOD SENSE OF TIMING SO 
CRITICAL TO THE EXECUTION OF HIS PLANS. HE IS NOT STUPID AND WILL NOT ATTEMPT TO
FACE ANYONE IN A STRAIGHT FIGHT IF HE CAN HELP IT. HE IS MOST AT HOME IN THE    
SANDS AND WILL BE HANDICAPPED IF FORCED TO WORK OUTSIDE OF THE DESERT REGIONS.  
         MOST OF THE ASSASSINATIONS HE HAS DONE HAVE BEEN POLITICALY BASED AND  
HE PREFERS TO WORK IN THAT CIRCLE. HIS AVERAGE PAY IS 500 G.P. PLUS THE COST OF 
POISONS.

Comment: A GREAT MAGE. ABU KAB SEEKS TO GAIN POWER OVER A RACE OF CREATURES     
CALLED THE GREATER WOLVES. TO DO THIS HE NEEDS THE WOLF BELL RECENTLY UNEARTHED 
IN THE CRYSTAL RANGES OF NEARBY TYRNOS WITH ITS SINGERS AND OTHER PESTS.        
         HE IS CONSTRAINED FROM ENTERING THE REGION BY AMOS KAB AND DOVA KABA   
BOTH OF WHOM HAVE A VESTED INTEREST IN KEEPING THEIR AREA FREE OF THE GREATER   
WOLVES. AS DO THE WOLVES THEMSELVES WHO WILL DO NOTHING TO HELP AND MUCH TO     
HINDER.                                                                         
       ABU KAB IS DEATHLY AFRAID OF BEL'KANI'KATA THE DEMON OF THOUGHT WHO ALSO 
INHABITS THIS PLANE.                                                            
       ANY PRIME MATERIAL ENTITY ON THIS PLANE WILL BE MUCH HARDER TO SCRY THAN 
NATIVES OF THE PLANE. IT IS FOR THIS REASON THAT ABU KAB WILL PROBABLY SUMMON A 
HEROE FROM THE PRIME MATERIAL PLANE AND TELL HIM THAT HIS TRUE NAME IS KNOWN TO 
ABU KAB AND HIS LIFE IS FORFEIT IF HE DARES REBEL.
