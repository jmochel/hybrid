Just a comment.....

Automatic fire and Burst fire.

This is done with military weapons only.  There are no weapons

automatic rates.  That aside, some definitions.


This is quite right or wrong, depending upon the state (USA) you are located
in. For example, in Oregon, I could have my background checked by the FBI
and local agencies, spend $300.00 for a Federal Stamp, and own _any_ auto
weapon of my choice. period. (I believe they may exclude cannons 8<).
I know of one character that had a quad-50 Cal in hisliving room. Yes it
worked. 8<)

Wow, my opinion of Oregon just shot up...  :)  Actually, if you go all the
way to the "top" (ie. the federal level) I think you can get a permit to 
carry/buy/do just about anything.  For instance, "possession of a concealed
firearm" is a crime in, I think, all states, but it's relatively easy to get
a permit to do so.  I think the point is, unless you go through some (usually)
serious bureaucracy, you can't just "buy" a full-auto weapon.

According to my Millenium's End rulebook (great reference source, eh?) an
automatic weapons permit is just $350, and a concealed weapons permit is a
steal at just $20...  :)

You are confusing semi-automatic weapons with fully automatic weapons. A
semi-automatic weapon is one that fires one round each time you squeeze the
trigger; a fully automatic weapons is one that fires more than one round
each time you squeeze the trigger.

Federal law prohibits the ownership of fully automatic weapons without a
federal permit. People who own such permits are mostly restricted to the
military, FBI, CIA, NSA, Federal Marshals, and the like. Private citizens
almost never can obtain such a permit (the exception here are federally
licensed weaponsmiths and the like). This includes everything from machine
pistols to SMGs to assault rifles to machineguns. The news often uses the
term "assault weapons"; this is inaccurate. Assault weapons are fully
automatic and are federally illegal. They use the term "assault weapon"
because it sounds much nastier than "semi-automatic rifle".

State laws regulate the ownership of semi-automatic weapons.
