As part of the elven design their conscious control focuses on the realm of 
interfaces with magic/magic patterns. The school of Kilnaemen (OK, so I renamed it)
is not a magic school as such, it is a discipline (composed of a series 
of skills) centering on controlled interaction of primary magic (sorceries) and
will with the rest of the patterns that make up the universe.

Typical skills:

Read Pattern
Lore:Power Patterns
Lore:Commonality Power Patterns (All the basis wizardry patterns )
W:Kilnaemen
S:Push (Sorcery verb for interacting with wizardry power pattern)
S:Pull (Sorcery verb for interacting with wizardry power pattern)

// All the myriad sorceries 

S:Fire
S:Water
S:Summon
S:Apply
etc...

Elven magery is mostly a series of sorceries. A Kata. 

At the normal usage level they are similar (if not identical to) human sorcerers.
Slightly faster , somewhat less sure. 

In using the wizardry power patterns their kata become more complex in that they 
their kata become a series of interactions with the power pattern in questions with 
a few other sorcery verbs thrown in while using pattern awareness 
skill W:Kilnaemen as a florentine and W:(Name of School) as a general skill.

Alex, I would like to run spells as Kata with all of their attendant 
speed and success differences. They will be faster but harder than 
human sorceries. By doing that almost no other differences would be 
required to balance elven magery. The instant attack mods will tend 
to force elves to stay with simple sorceries most of the time.

Normal sorceries such as fire attack would be 

Kata: Fire Attack
	S:Fire
	S:Summon
	S:Apply
	
As a kata.

Whereas a wizardry manipulation would be 

Kata: Abjurational Ward 
	S:Power
	(Florentine: Kilnaemen) && S:Ward
	(Florentine: Kilnaemen) && S:Bind
	(Florentine: Kilnaemen) && S:Push

More bookkeeping would be required but it would also explain why elves adapt well 
in mid-crisis (rolling a concentration check during a cast is a jump in a kata) and why 
they do improv spells all the time. 

It also leads to some fun and games in effect where a normal 
failure in wizardry would cause just a failure an elven failure 
could leave the kata two thirds finbished (Fire has been summoned 
but not applied....).

Some suggested sorcery nouns and verbs (specifically for elves):

(Look familiar ?)

Nouns
=====================================================================
The nouns are the common forms of energy or conversations that can be 
manipulated (common to an elf).

Context - Attributes that can be changed via 

1-4	[X, Y, Z, T] within current context
5	reality mass of current context
6	Relationship between 


Power			- Abjuration
Context Generator	- Mind
Seeming			- Illusion
Time			- Chronomancy...

Context			- Conjuration
	Locale Media (~ plane)
	Locale within Media (~ physical location on plane)	

Conversation		- Divination

Matter			- Matter

Elements
	Earth
	Fire
	Air
	Water
	Light 
	Dark
	Life
	Death
	Nature
	Decay

Verbs
=====================================================================

All the verbs involve altering the attributes of something in this reality. 

	Alter Attribute	(with some ungainly cost)

And there are some commonly excercised versions of this:

Detect		Identifying the existence of something. 
Conceal		Hiding the existence of something

Perceive 	Determining something about an object such as its location or nature.
Hide 		Blocking the determination of the attributes of an object or occurence.

Summon		Bringing energy to the immediate locale .
Banish		Returning energy from the immediate locale to its origin.

Create		The generation of an energy from nothing.
Destroy		The elimination of an energy from existence.

Concentrate	The gathering of energy from the nearby region to a more intense whole.
Dissapate	The scattering of energy into a more diffuse form.

Transport	Alter locale in the medium by going through the medium.
Translocate	Alter locale in the medium without going through the medium.

Bind		To tie energy to a reality construct.
Release		Unbinding (not in the Thamaturgic sense)

Shape		Alter form in the medium

Enhance		To strengthen one attribute (makes it harder to alter)

Damage		To rend or otherwise hurt. 
Restore

Transmutation	Change one type of power into another.

Anchoring	To prevent translocation.
Influence
Control

Connect		Establish relation

How some current sorceries would be expressed
==============================================

Detect Power		Power, Detect
Detect Mind		Context Generator, Detect
See Planes		Context Media, Perceive 
Identify Power		Power, Perceive
Identify Item		Matter, Perceive
Read Aura		Seeming, Perceive
Foreseeing		Conversation, Perceive

Shape Aura		Seeming, Shape
Detect Aura		Seeming, Detect

Telepathy		Mind, Connect
Mind Shield		Mind, Enhance
Mind Attack		Mind, Damage
