		Mordanith meets Raven AKA Raven. I Receive a note from a
		friend in the mages guild that indicates that their may be a
		mage of interest in the Inn of the 3 Moons. We head to visit
		that Inn. We encounter a press gang. We frighten them off with
		a brief show of magery ( and some shapechanging). We pass by
		the usual city sights such a human beating another human. We
		leave them alone to their entertainments.
		</p>
		<p type=scene>		
            Inn of the 3 Moons. 10' Ceiling, 5 lamps, smokey, 4 tables,
    		3 booths, small bar, bartender with a rose tattoo on forehead, dual
	    	tulwars. Morphus is seated here.
		</p>
		<p>
		I meet with the elderly mage who calls himself Morphus. We are
		joined by a older human who calls himself Zacalatar of the
		Bright One . He inquires as to whether we are mages and what
		we are planning. He claims that the Bright One is a patron
		of mages. Later it was disclosed to Mordanith that the person
		was a cleric of . We are recruited by a Bengali mercenary
		to help as guards for a caravan to excavate a forbidden city
		and when we meet with a human about the jobs Morphus is challenged
		to prove that he is a mage. Morphus blows a brazier to kingdom come
		and we are asked to market our skills elsewhere.
		</p>
		<p>
		We return to the Inn but Mordanith returns to the Bazaar and
		convinces the human who hires for the caravan that he would do
		well to hire us all. He consents to take us back but Morphus is
		my responsibility ( Though they will feed him ).
		</p>
		<p>
		When Mordanith returns to the Inn of the 3 Moons he is accosted
		by a dwarf. The dwarf challenges Mordanith to a single combat.
		Mordanith returns to the Inn for witnesses. The two face off outside
		the inn and Mordanith blasts the Dwarf a 80 point Psi Blast.
		The dwarf staggers and attacks Mordanith. Mordanith dodges but
		is also attacked by several of the dwarves' companions. Mordanith
		survives, thanks in great part to his companions and a critical
		matter blast against the axe handle of one the his attackers. The
		blast vaporizes the haft of the axe.
		</p>
		<p>
		The Booty Collected from the dwarf includes
		A Gold medallion with a black circle and inset red claw.
		5 Gold Pieces. 5 bones. Long for finger bones. The dwarfs armour.
		</p>
		<p>
		We collect the weapons and booty from the bodies after waiting in vain
		for some sort of city guard. Mordanith, Morphus, the Volga Dogman,
		his dog, and Raven head back and get instructions regarding where we are
		going and why.
		</p>
		<p>
		We are to head 30 miles SW from Marden to the Burghers road. We
		are to travel 20 miles down this road to a town called Grozz's
		End.  It should be a small village. There
		should be a small church
		of Hercules. There, we will talk with the priest and then investigate
		the rumor that there is a new buried city. We will be supplied
		with expenses. We are given 1 Gold and 16 sp up front.

		An elf walks in and introduces himself as Mordanith Etc. A man
		past middle age joins us and says he is Zacalatar of the Bright
		One. He asks if we are mages and whether we have plans. He claims
		that the Bright One is a patron of mages.So What?
		</p>
		<p>
		We move about Marden, inquire about a buried city (Zakatlin)
		we've heard  about. We go to Narvi, a caravan master, for employment
		and possibly some interesting information at the end of the trip. I
		attempt to show him my worth by lighting his brazier. Unfortunately,
		Mordanith helps me and we both critical. We obliterate the brazier.
		Narvi sends us packing. We go back to the Inn but Mordanith returns
		gets us back in good graces, and convinces Narvi to hire us, \dots er
		well, him, and I get to come along, food but no pay.
		</p>
		<p>
		When Mordanith comes back, he calls us to be witness' at a duel. The
		dwarf who challenged him gets blasted, attacks, and when Mordanith
		dodges, he is attacked by the dwarf's companions. We join in and help
		and he blows up one of the dwarves axe handles. They either die or
		scatter. The dwarf and his party were members of the Fire Claw
		Mercenaries. We retrieve a gold medallion with a black circle and an
		inset red claw, 5 gold pieces, 5 bones(long finger bones), the
		dwarf's armour, gold ring, silver necklace. We encounter an old
		beggar who offers a prophecy. I know I can do better. I challenge him
		to a prophesy duel.
		</p>
		<p>
		I Prophesy
		</p>

        <p type=prophecy>
    	Fire, Blood, Gold, Blade \\

		<p>
		Mordanith gives silver to both of us. We negotiate for ghurka,
		decide not to get them.
		</p>

		<p>
		No guard appears, so we take our booty and get our instructions
		regarding our trip. We are to head 30 miles SW from Marden, to the
		Burghers road. Travel 20 miles down this road to a small village
		called Grozz's End. We are to find the Church of Hercules, speak to
		the priest, and investigate the rumor of part of a buried city. Paid
		on return, 1 gold piece per two week period. In addition, 1 gold piece and 16 sp for
		food and lodging for two weeks on the road.

		of Possession (Nasty).  We don't do so good, but Mordanith heads into
		the aether for help. He brings back a Paladin of Arioch. The Paladin
		Kicks Ass! We learn they travel in threes, so the Paladin goes after

		Priest of Dal Pan welcomes us and we rest. I fail a silence

		whirlwind and creates an area of Null Air. I drink a lot, cast a
		telekinesis spell, blow self across room. Attempt to remove
		alcohol, end up doubling it, become comatose.  Bandits are
		approaching on ghurka back.

		Mordanith helps me, uncovers some of my hidden power. I attempt
		to Meditate (No Skill of course =>02) and see a swordsman,
		someone wielding 2 swords, an elven mage wearing green robes;
		sometime in the past or future I  see a high vaulted room, falcon
		laid out on altar. Creature, big tattered black robe, black
		fangs, talons, long black hair, red eyes, pointed ears. Long obsidian
		knife, sprinkles red liquid over unconscious bird. He sees me and
		starts to  move toward me. I back out, go forward, and then
		dissipate it. Critical Meditate when I try to set up shield for
		Mordanith. Shield disappears. I turn into cardinal (true
		alteration) fly to ruins, avoid blue mist, break into tower,
		find Mordanith, CatBird, dark aura, Foresee past Abjuration
		symbols on green robe elf, break down binding on mind, leave
		weak, release power, attempt to  shape change and shape remaining
		power to put peg back in. Go unconscious.  Wake up and use points
		to go astral, flap to Mordanith, use all but 1 POW to heal
		Mordanith with Light and Air (09 on heal) Must drop back to
		regular plane. Go into mage trance to conserve power.
		CatBird picks me up in mouth and flies out of tower.
		</p>
		<p>
		Time passes, the Dullo helps me regain Morphus. I get Mordanith
		and heal him. A few days go by, CatBird gets elvish priest,
		cures Mordanith and does it in the other priest's church which
		destroys the priest's wards. We leave  quickly. We ride south. As
		we set up camp that evening the dogs (Jaws and Dullo) go
		hunting. The Elf sets up wards. During the night the Falcon spots
		a group of glowing eyed Targs.

        Regis Galtoon the IV \- Diviner (I know him?) speaks with Mordanith
		</p>

		<p>
		I speak with Corian the Pyromancer who learned from the Firelords
		school,  Numeste. The braziers channel 500 pts at a time, up to
		2000 pts per hour,  1200 pts per day. Each additional brazier
		adds a non\-linear amount. The max  is 20 braziers which can
		provide 40000 pts at any one time. This link is  reversible from
		either side. From the master others can be destroyed. Others  can
		be linked to each other. Transport is possible in fire form. Each
		brazier is  warded against physical damage and a 20 pt ward
		sealed against magic and the  fey. It requires 3 days to cast A
		ritual of setting, ritual of opening, ritual of  linking, and a
		ritual of permanence. The adepts are thaumaturges, a ritual of
		closing should deactivate it. Firelord uses them as eyes and
		mouth.  His temple  is 400' on a side, octagonal in shape, and a
		pillar of flame 600' in the air  coming from it. Corian has 30
		books on his shelf, one is by Aicroven (sp?) of  the seven
		towers.
		</p>
		<p>
		See high priest and ask for book from Corians shelf after advising
		that they be removed from his possession. I make a list of the books
		written in Multath and  get a list of the books written in Hetasian.

		We head out. We are confronted by a small mob of

		on. We are stopped at the gate and we wait for the gates-men to find
		out about our status. We are then allowed to travel on.
		</p>
		<p>
		We exit the city. A poor thief tries to steal from us. The poor
		guy gets his clothes repulsed from him as Vartigan beheads him.
		</p>
		<p>
		We find a river bed. Morphus casts a major ritual; and then the
		falcon sees a group of people in the distance on the other side of
		the river bed. Vartigan and the two dogs go to investigate.
		</p>
		<p>
		Steam rises from the ground, Morphus does a three hour ritual.
		He brings up out of the ground a 400' long, 50' wide bridge with
		4' side walls. We see Regis's divination orb above us. We also see a
		summoned creature of Jarek's attack the orb. Both disappear.

		We start out at 5:00 am. The temple guards knock people out of the
		courtyard to clear our path.
		</p>
		<p>
		Morphus and the party come to a 20' wide gap with a stream at the
		bottom (10' down). While others decide what to do, Morphus dismounts
		and begins a spell to create a small bridge of stone. The results are
		a 50' wide rock bridge, 60 ft high at the center, 400' long, side
		walls 4' above bridge surface, shallow angle roughened surface. Regis
		long "sees" us and shields us from the firebird. I add a Rune of

		When the horses return I tell the Pinto that I can't have a mount

		</p>
		<p>
		Dullo changes into a perfect version of the bush he studied at
		the temple of hercules.
		</p>
		<p>
		He so perfectly mimicks the bush that he summons up some faery.
		Mordanith aids the summoning by granting it power. Morphus
		takes advantage of the this to grow three trees (Oak, Birch,
		Redwood) and uses them to produce a staff with three woods.
		</p>
		<p>
		Mordanith calls his father and tells him of his travels.
		Father sends two scrolls , a pouch with 10 platinum wires in it.
		A message from dad. A silver Holy Symbol, new clothes.
		</p>
		<p>
		Meanwhile Vartigan and CatBird go to see what is happening with a
		vulture circling above a point three miles away.
		</p>
		<p>
		They encounter and slay a priest feeling up a dead body. The
		priest had 2 pals whom they also slay. \dots
		As the second fireball impacts on the grove, Morphus absorbs its
		power and feeds it to the golden tree. Mordanith , the archer, and
		Vartigan ride towards the nearest plateau. We ride, we stop, we see a
		firehawk fly overhead. Mordanith casts a power shield over
		himself. Vartigan heads back towards the grove.
		</p>
		<p>
		\dots We succeed in getting a very good distance away. We ride
		desperately and then dismount. Mordanith figures that the
		FireHawk is between 88-60 minutes away.
		</p>
		<p>
		I fail my dismount but land nicely. When Mordanith's dignity has
		recovered He crosses the stream he starts casting at the river's
		edge.

		Sunrise. There is minor interaction, Vartigan puts on full armor,
		sees black bird. Dullo uses many types of magic and transforms
		into bush.  I plant my three  twigs and prepare to pump Nature,
		Life, and Light  into my creation (and summon water). They flower
		(birch has golden  leaves) temperature lowers. Mordanith has
		opened a door to faery. I have planted in faery. I reclaim three
		twigs. Mage trance, setup,  wizardry. Hold tree magic back, a
		small spring  appears at each tree.  I link with Sigmund and ask
		him to wait. Sigmund accesses the power the Linking Ward of Nureyev was
		created with. Mordanith's father  casts a spell and the trees grow
		more rapidly. Dullo regains shape but leaves  most of the bush
		behind. A shooting star impacts, Sigmund channels to  me and  the
		excess to his power source (sink?), space enclosed with  rock. He
		deactivates, but I shape twice and bind it to the rock that
		Sigmund threw into  the Faery area. I change it into a
		crystalline  form. ( it glows and the trees don't want to be anywhere
		near the  fire energy.) 7 hours go by.
		</p>
		<p>
		Another fire ball approaches. I setup for a shape of fire to
		light. I do so but fail to channel it to the tree. Good thing,
		because it takes only a portion of a  potential overdose.
		</p>
		<p>
		All three trees now have the same growth amount. The stone is
		glowing  brighter, its form more compact. I have used a lot of
		spell points. I feel that I am currently at 15 spell points. I
		drop into mage trance and telepath Mordanith.  We will attempt to
		create a shaping ward to shield against future fireballs.
		Mordanith says he can't spare the power. I realize that I can't
		maintain for the 1.5 hours needed to complete the spell. I setup
		for a last ditch attempt to finish in minutes. I will need to
		summon water, shape and bind. I summon  water and shape the stone
		into an oblate spheroid. I address each tree in turn  and ask for
		help from its Dryad. I shape the power of faery and my own POW
		and create the staff, surrounding the stone at the crown. I fail
		a willpower roll  however. I finish my binding. I am one with all
		three trees and the staff  (physically one). I manage to separate
		the staff from the trees. I draw power  from outside and from
		Mordanith. I reach earth and trees and shape earth into the  old
		form of Morphus. The grove of trees stops growing, with the pool
		still off-center, and the bush in the center. Between the trees
		is an elvish pattern of  transfer.
		</p>
		<p>
		Morphus unconscious, Mordanith and CatBird put me on horse. I wake
		up on  ground, mount and ride. I have 1 POW and 3 HTK. The
		firebird fans a fire  towards us. We run into a gulley. I try to
		stop, but the horse goes forward. I  hang on for dear life,
		realize that the horse won't make it and let go. Magic  grasps
		me, my staff glows golden, I land softly on the other side. We follow
		the  gulley. We find Vartigan and he sees the cut on my horse. I
		had put something on the cuts. The horses leg is starting to
		swell. I dismount, spread my bedroll,  enter a mage trance and
		sleep. I wake up to see a Dissenta, hobble in back of him as he
		and Sigmund fight. When I get in back of him I attempt to stab
		him in the back with my staff, miss and as he turns to me, Jaws
		gets him. I get up and the Singing Warrior starts to attack me.
		( He has been hit by a Dissenta  dagger) I hobble to Mordanith,
		warn him, and slip into mage trance, sleep.  I go back to the
		horses, mount and mage trance and after a while I slip into
		healing trance. for the four days necessary for the trip back to
		the  city.

		After traveling a good portion of the
		night we come within sight of a small village. On the way we
		encounter a dark robed individual that is able to dance a dance
		of {\it Comprehend Languages} that allows us to communicate.
		</p>
		<p>
		We go into the village and trade the villagers horses for
		mammalian ghurka-like beasts that resemble aircraft carriers
		{\it (Lotas)} and others that walk upright {\it (LaVitien)}.

		<p>
		We obtain 1 Ghurka, IIII Lotas, and II LaVitien.

		We travel on that morning. We encounter and are
		attacked by some death and dark individuals in robes near a
		deserted building.
		</p>
		<p>
		We counter by drawing on a great deal of earth power from a
		nearby node. We are then attacked by a glowing, flying, godlet
		who opens fire at us with power that is barely stopped by the
		wards around Mordanith. Between Mordanith's wards and batteries
		we seem to be holding him but not much more. When we seem to be
		bothering him he appears to call for aid. Meanwhile, Sigmund, in
		stealth mode, moves slowly towards him and sneaks next to him.
		</p>
		<p>
		We are approached by a Firehawk that Erithmaen grants the
		courtesy of a severe downdraft that brings it into the earth
		stream (Giant Sand Blast) we have been directing at the Godlet.
		</p>
		<p>
		{\large BOOM ! }
		</p>
		<p>
		Sigmund backstabs the imp riding on the godlet's shoulder.
		Godlet smashes Sigmund to the ground as he gets badly burned by
		earth power flooding over him from the PASED. Power Amplification
		by the Stimulated Emission of Dirt. Godlet takes to the air as we
		extend our PASED to reach over 500'. We nick him in mid-air but

		<p>
		We talk to Arak. We sleep. We talk to the
		Kwato (A wonderful, tension filled moment for all). We ask about the Black
		sword and the Dragon Sword. We find out somethings about the Black Sword.
		</p>
		<p>
		{\it AT SOME LATER DATE }
		Mordanith talks to the Orange Mage and asks for
		a Teleport Skyhook.
		</p>
		<p>
		We talk to the Orange Mage about are various Stories.
		We meet with the master healer. She is a half-Sindar, Half-Quenyan
		named Anthea. Her name is in full : Lady Anthea Whisper
		Star Aliendrill Thentyaren Moontago Ephasion, Student of the
		Crescent Moon, Master Healer of the Council of Marden.
		We go to an inn. We exchange the casting of a ward
		against fire on the innkeeper's wagon.
		</p>
		<p>
		{\it LATER}
		We head out the next morning to see the Mages guild.
		Morphus blows the testing crystal to Kingdom Come. We deal with
		the weapons master Triam Hellsplitter.
		CatBird gets 10 Shuriken and 10 Shaken. She also buys extra claws
		for Cheetah. Erithmean buys a whip. GoldenThroat gets a Bow and Arrows.
		Sigmund buys Boomerang and Chabats including a returning chabat with
		a gem in the hilt. Mordanith buys a magery neutral staff.
		</p>
		<p>
		{\it LATER}
		CatBird and Sigmund head out for training. They head to the place
		where they met the guild person before.
		There is a nude woman there. They enter the room they were in before. The
		young guide they met is still there. ``You are here! Now what would you like to
		study ?''. They talk  to him for awhile. ``CatBird, there is a blue marble
		somewhere on my person, I would like you to acquire it sometime in the next
		4 hours''. They practice with various tricky testing procedures such as
		``Identify the  mark''.
		</p>
		<p>
		They head back around 4 am and go to sleep for awhile. Sigmund practices
		using his zoom lenses. Somewhere starts singing the distance at sunup.
		Mordanith notices that the human morning-singer is late in his call that
		morning. Golden Throat and Morphus clean their blades. Morphus is convinced
		not to use his robe as a polishing cloth. Erithmaen is woken up by Mordanith
		attempting to telekinese his pillow. The group gets up and gets mobile. They
		head out to the weapon trainers.
		</p>
		<p>
		At the weapons trainer. The young female is there and says hi to Morphus.
		The trainer is a block of black muscle with mohawk type haircut. 6'2'' -
		6'3''. Obviously Ex-gladiator. Bodrox is his name. Sigmund is training
		in Chabat and axe. CatBird is training in knives, Grapple HTH. Erithmaen
		gets training
		in defense and whip. Mordanith trains in grappling, defense, and staff.
		CatBird asks about training for cats. Morphus trains in sword and staff.
		Golden Throat trains in Unarmed Combat and Staff (Golden Throat is ranked to
		the 3rd level in the Marden Fighters Guild in Greatsword and to the 4th level
		in longbow). The trainer mentions that he knows an elven gladiator he can talk
		to. CatBird changes into a cat in the weapons shop and discusses things
		with the trainer. The trainer thinks that CatBird needs to train with a beast
		handler.
		</p>
		<p>
		After training most of them head to the mage's guild in order to
		do research and train in Tolnedran runes. Morphus watches for babes.
		Morphus spots a babe. The rest of them try to cover for his
		indiscretions. Morphus woos while Sigmund keeps watch.
		Her: ``That must have been some time old man, before the cataclysm''.
		``I have heard some pick up lines in my time, and that was pretty good''.
		</p>
		<p>
		Erithmaen talks to the Orange Mage about what work he can do. One of the
		librarians leaves off some books with Erithmaen and asays that the master
		alterationist Karban has asking after Mordanith.
		</p>
		<p>
		CatBird attempts to shapechange into Cat. She KIF meditates and then
		attempts a change. She appears in a spherical bubble and then ``pop''
		she's a hawk.
		</p>
		<p>
		She sleeps.
		</p>
		<p>
		{\bf THE NEXT DAY}
		We meet with the Master Alterationist and a Frankish Priest
		and a Frankish Knight. There is also a locksmith with them and a ranger.
		They are on a quest to recover the keys of Heimdall.
		</p>
		<p>
		{\bf The Next Day}
		Notes on Thieves in Marden: Every once in a while the Kakahn will
		clean up the thieves. A really good thief avoids having a name that
		can be used as a divination handle.
		</p>
		<p>
		At CatBird's and Sigmund's training they get the usual greetings and hints on
		what information the guild rep will pay for.
		</p>
		<p>
		CatBird's thief friend Mario exchanges statue jokes with Sigmund.
		He details out what happened to Jessey when she was stealing from
		a temple. She got torched.
		</p>
		<p>
		A man walks up behind them. Dressed in a long black robe. The robe is magical.
		He has a sight avoider spell on him. A red sash , black wrapped sandals. He has
		rank markings of the red sash on his robe and a bronze ring on his
		left hand.
		</p>
		<p>
		He heads through a doorway into a well appointed room and gestures them to sit.
		``I am Minkuwar, I am the local representative of the Red Sash. I understand
		that you have had several run-ins with Jarek Firelord''.
		</p>
		<p>
		``Discretion was one of the reasons you were chosen. We are talking about
		50,000 Dorean Gold and the magic item of your choice. The target is the
		ambassador Keerlin of Jarek Firelord who is staying at the Sultan's palace. He
		has five crystals that contain information on how to link to the monastery fire
		pits.  You have one week to succeed''.
		</p>
		<p>
		``The Red Sash are contracted not to enter the Sultan's palace. We have
		detailed room layout and personal habits. The ambassador is a 8th rank mage
		and a skilled martial artist. Jarek has declared formal war against Marden.
		The crystals contain 300 Mage Units of power. We don't care about the
		ambassador's life or other casualties.
		</p>
		<p>
		Minkuwar gives details on how to contact him through the guild and he gives
		CatBird a scroll. He leaves.
		</p>
		<p>
		CatBird buys a contact in the palace. A buyer of silks and linens.
		</p>
		<p>
		The Sultan's Palace is 27 buildings , 2 stories on average. Most of the palace
		is barred to all but the upper crust of the nobility. The inner palace is open
		only to the Sultan and his family.
		</p>
		<p>
		Mario has a hissy fit about the task. Mario does know someone who has gotten in
		and out of the palace.
		</p>
		<p>
		Meanwhile Mordanith does a divination on the best investment for CatBird's
		money.
		</p>
		<p type=foreseeing>
		{\sc Foreseeing: } There is a merchant, Abu, leaving the city in two weeks.
		He will travel across the Phelosian plains, through Dau Shao, to Pentarra. He
		will be transporting Dorean Silks and Rugs (155 time there buying price here).
		It will tie up the funds for 12 months and he will return to Marden in two
		years. He is honest.
		</p>
		<p>
		Mordanith sleeps and sigmund and CatBird come back. CatBird shuts the windows
		and wakes all of the party up. ``We have been given a most unusual
		commissions \dots

		<p>
		CatBird goes to see Palis the diviner, recommended by the Mage Guild.
		</p>
		<p>
		He first tries some straight divining.
		</p>
		<p>
		``I see a bird, I see a green man, I see a world with two suns,
		I see seven towers''.
		</p>
		<p>
		He then pulls out a set of cards and he has CatBird touch them.
		She leaves no magical imprint.
		</p>
		<p>
		``The Wizard King will play a tremendous part in your future. I sense
		the prophecy but it is obscured, does it involve a Grey Elf ?''
		</p>
		<p>
		CatBird changes her shape in the room in front of him and then changes back.
		</p>
		<p>
		``You don't have a soul, at least not here''.
		</p>
		<p>
		``The answer lies in the past with the fall of the Citadel of the Seven.
		The answers can be found in the places from which the forms come. Especially that
		of the cat. And if you ever meet someone there tell them that you are Etra''.
		</p>
		<p>
		``I would discover more about you but it would involve a spell that I have not cast
		in many years. It is a dangerous spell for it places much stress on the space
		time fabric. I do not think it advisable at this time. I will have some time
		in six months. For a price I could be convinced to cast this spell. I would
		require the aid of the master conjurer.''
		</p>
		<p>
		``Where Muriel is is extremely unclear''.
		</p>
		<p>
		``You are you, not a demon, not a construct''.
		</p>
		<p>
		At that point the diviner gets a headache trying to figure it all out.
		</p>
		<p>
		That same day we travel as a crowd to the other side of the city to visit the
		caravaneer Abu Tanji. We give him money to buy new equipment, guards, and wagons.
		We advise Abu to buy silks and rugs.
		</p>
		<p>
		We travel to a decent area of town with Abu and deposit the money with a
		money lender. The money lender is named Devin. We are offered tea while
		Devin grovels. Devin has several slaves with Theridden abjurational crystals
		embedded. Devin tries to eavesdrop on a conversation between CatBird and
		Mordanith.
		</p>
		<p>
		{\it While in Marden the group does a variety of standard things
		each day: Morphus spends time doing book research, weapon training, and studying
		Hetasian with the singing warrior. He chases babes and practises speaking
		Cat and Bird with CatBird.
		</p>
		<p>
		Sigmund hangs out at the repossession guild and trains. Practises Ward Disarming
		and Grounding Power.
		</p>
		<p>
		CatBird hangs out at he repo guild and trains there. She studies Tolnidren and Weapons.
		Renews old Marden contacts and teaches the Singing Warrior to do Rap.
		</p>
		<p>
		Erithmaen spends his time talking with his old master and doing Weapons training
		as well as taking remedial Alteration classes. Lots of research and
		translation work.
		</p>
		<p>
		}
		</p>
		<p>
		That evening the Master Healer of Marden, the Lady Anthea, visits Mordanith.
		She asks why Mordanith travels with Kheldar . Mordanith explains the
		circumstances of their meeting and describes what links Morphus and the rest of
		the party together. In addition Mordanith describes all the prophecies
		and paths associated with Kheldar/Morphus.
		</p>
		<p>
		She decides not to interfere with Morphus/Kheldar. She aso answers some
		of Mordanith's questions about Kheldar   .
		</p>
		<p>
		He rises to challenges quickly, he believes he is capable of more than
		he actually is. He has little skill with Light. He is a sex fiend. He
		is a drunkard.
		</p>
		<p>
		Kheldar  has enemies among the Greens.
		</p>
		<p>
		Mordanithtalks with Morphusabout her visit. We then talk of other things.
		</p>
		<p>
		Morphus has no clue about any connection between Muriel, a Monastery and
		CatBird. He has not been able to come up with a copy of the story of the
		Black Rose. The Black Rose is a story supposedly about Kheldar  and Muriel.
		He digs out a Black Rose from his bag. His shell stretches and then relaxes.
		</p>

		<title></title>
		<date>Later</date>
		<p>
		Morphus visits Palis the diviner to ask questions about a bronze ring he
		pulls out of his bag. The Diviner cracks his stone trying to take a peek
		at Morphus's future, against the good advice of Morphus.
		</p>
		<p>
		{\it Palis\ } ``The ring is the key to a place, it opens a specific
		door to a castle''
		</p>
		<p>
		{\it Morphus\ } `` Is that all, what would happen if I put the ring on my
		finger'' ?
		</p>
		<p>
		{\it Palis\ } ``You would have a ring on your finger ! I don't think you
		are supposed to use it like a magic item where you say a magic word and
		a fireball comes out !''
		</p>
		<p>
		Morphus puts the ring on and is immediately aware that it is the real ring.
		He senses a pattern and decides to talk with it.
		</p>
		<p>
		{\it Ring\ } ``Hello''
		</p>
		<p>
		{\it Morphus\ } ``Hi''
		</p>
		<p>
		{\it Ring\ } ``Hello''
		</p>
		<p>
		{\it Morphus\ } ``You know I don't know who you are in a concise sort of
		way. So are you my memories that I don't have ?''
		</p>
		<p>
		{\it Ring\ } ``No''
		</p>
		<p>
		{\it Morphus\ } ``Are you my soul ?''
		</p>
		<p>
		{\it Ring\ } ``No ! I am an artificial pattern of abjuration that contains
		your personality.''
		</p>
		<p>
		{\it Morphus\ } ``At what date were you inset, I have changed.''
		</p>
		<p>
		{\it Ring\ } ``That is true''.
		</p>
		<p>
		{\it Morphus\ } ``When'' ?
		</p>
		<p>
		{\it Ring\ } ``Right after your last meeting with the Gray Wanderers''.
		</p>
		<p>
		{\it Morphus\ } ``The one where we decided not to meet again?''
		</p>
		<p>
		{\it Ring\ } ``Yes.''
		</p>
		<p>
		{\it Morphus\ } ``Do you have the minutes of the meeting ?''
		</p>
		<p>
		The ring does but the date is 980, roughly 35 years after Morphus thought
		it was. The ring also discovers that it has been inactive longer than
		it expected. Kheldar    was worried that one of the Gray Wanderers was a traitor
		but he did not know which one it was. The ring and Morphus argue over who
		is the real Kheldar  ! The ring and Morphus argue over the locale of the Ice Castle. It
		doesn't have any mental coordinates.
		</p>
		<p>
		The ring is known to the Gray Wanderers and they may know when the ring
		is being used. They will definitely know when the ring is being used to
		open the Ice Castle.
		</p>
		<p>
		The ring notes that the only bound sentience that it knows that
		doesn't glow like a fucking neon sign is the sword MistSlicer, the
		Sword of Light. Guardians don't count because they are elementals.
		</p>
		<p>
		{\it Ring\ } ``Don't be afraid to use me except when Gray Wanderers
		are around.''
		</p>
		<p>
		{\it Palis\ } ``So what does it do ?''
		</p>
		<p>
		{\it Morphus\ } ``It has my personality but not my memories so
		it is annoying the hell out of me.''
		</p>
		<p>
		Morphus gives Palis the minutes of the last meeting of the Gray Wanderers.
		Kheldar and the Ice Wolf were breaking the contract. Kheldar had damaged the
		mind of someone the ring's personality was stored in. Morphus promised to
		tell Palis what really happened at the last meeting of the Gray Wanderers.
		</p>
		<p>
		{\it Ring } ``Once we get tothe Ice Castle you can figure out what 
		happened to you. It's where all of your items are. I know where the 
		Ice Castle is.
		</p>
		<p>
		{\it Palis\ }
		The ring is an artifact that the other Gray Wanderers know about and 
		they may know when it is being used.
		</p>
		<p>
		Mordanith contacts Uncle Tom's Habadashery and orders Silver and Silk thread from him.
		</p>
		<p>
		Later Morphus pulls the ring out again.
		He asks bout the \LWON . The ring
		tells him that it shapes power and mana. Kheldar    helped Nureyev design and
		implement the linking ward and Sigmund. Nureyev was a master Alterationist/
		Evocationist.
		</p>
		<p>
		Kheldar    did this when he was in his desperation phase. Of course, that was
		before the Icelord came. Kheldar    established certain portals and connections
		to allow him to access the Linking Ward. Sigmund was one, the Lizard Fortu was
		another. As far as we can determine, the Linking Ward is a distributed network.
		</p>
		<p>
		We also confirm that the \LWON contains the keys to
		the Bifrost.
		</p>
		<p>
		Mordanith boggles at the thought of CatBird walking the pattern.
		</p>
		<p>
		Morphus, Sigmund and Erithmaen analyze the ring's design.
		The ring is composed of :
		</p>
		<p>
		\begin{description}
		\item An abjurational shaping pattern
		\item An evocation pattern (offensive)
		\item An Alteration shaping pattern
		\item All linked to a single trigger spell
		\end{description}
		</p>
		<p>
		The pattern is similiar to that of Morphus and there is an
		active energy source.
		</p>
		<p>
		Mordanith picks up the ring and the ring attempts to zap him.
		</p>
		<p>
		Ring `` You let a bad guy touch it!''
		</p>
		<p>
		Morphus `` Are Elves bad guys ?''
		</p>
		<p>
		Ring ``Clearly !''
		</p>
		<p>
		The ring queries Morphus as to why he's running around with the Bad Guys.
		</p>
		<p>
		Morphus `` I am worried about the Bad Guys who want to destroy everything
		and everyone.''
		</p>
		<p>
		Ring (In a scornful voice)  ``Ohhhhhhh, so your sleeping with them now to get
		at the other !''
		</p>
		<p>
		Morphus ``Think about who we are.''
		</p>
		<p>
		Ring ``Yeah ?''
		</p>
		<p>
		Morphus ``Well, we've never had any trouble sleeping with anybody !''
		</p>
		<p>
		Ring ``I hate it when you are right !''
		</p>
		<p>
		Ring (muttered) ``Never go to the elves for answers, cause they will tell
		you, that's what I always say..''
		</p>
		<p>
		Morphus announces to all of the party that he had talked with Falstaff.
		He discovered that Kheldar  helped in the design of the Ward of Dof
		Sifrin.  Supposedly Falstaff and Kheldar  voluntarily warded their memories
		so that they could no longer use the Gates of Chronos and thus bypass
		the Ward of Dof Sifrin. Kheldar  and Falstaff learned how to mainpulate
		time from the Karestaen.
		</p>
		<p>
		Also, the Rainbow Order was started to give people purpose and sort of
		snowballed.
		</p>
		<p>
		Falstaff has told Morphus that Kay as well as Vartigan, Sigmund,
		Mordanith, and himself will face the Wizard King. Falstaff will
		pick us up on the way.
		</p>
		<p>
		Kay and Falstaff helped design the \LWON .
		They modified the notes that Nureyev wrote. After the notes were done,
		Kheldar helped create the linking ward \footnote{This was done without Falstaffs
		knowledge}. He also helped Nureyev design Sigmund during his desperation phase.
		The \LWON was based on neural patterns and may have become sentient. The ward
		allows the user to alter time flow without damaging the Ward of Dof Sifrin.
		There are no passwords to the \LWON, it decides who may link with it. There
		are 15 access ports to the \LWON, among them Sigmund and the Lizard Fortu.
		Nureyev made the Power Grid of Alkresh. The Bronze Ring that Morphus carries
		has a structure similiar to that of the \LWON.  According to the ring, the
		\LWON is alive , abjurational, and can shape and transfer power. The ring
		also has detailed design notes on Sigmund. .
		</p>
		<p>
		The Citadel of the Seven fell 700 years ago. It was located in Dau
		Shao. There are currently many demons in the citadel. Someone was working on
		CatBird's style of shapechanging. Muriel was connected to the Tower of
		the Seven and studied under Petras, a master of conjuring and dreamwalking.
		She learned to DreamWalk  with Kheldar   .There is some sort of tragedy
		associated with their relationship. The tragedy was the inspiration
		for the play ``The Black Rose''. Nygold, Kheldar's apprentice, was
		one of the Seven. Acrivan wrote some books.
		</p>
		<p>
		There are many Kheldars in Marden history. There are records of 54
		different Kheldars being born, 38 are artists, priests, historians, etc.
		One priest led an unsuccessful  revolt against the sultan. There is also one
		gladiator. 5 mages from Tolnia, 8 mages from Marden, 3 mages from Dal Shao.
		One may have been born on a summer solstice. That one was involved in the
		overthrow of the Pentarate. Kheldar had many famous offspring.
		Koral the Sunlord was his daughter. Corel the Enchanter King
		was his son. He is also rumoured to have mated with the
		Elf Queen of the Blue Sea. Kheldar is also rumored to
		have grown up in the Garden district of Marden, raised by the Order
		of Pro Sensus. The Order of Pro Sensus was destroyed in a holy war.
		</p>
		<p>
		The Gray Wanderers were aided by Aurioch. The GW were given an
		Ice Castle by Aurioch.  All GW were required
		to be swordsman. The charter of the GW was fairly basic: They were to
		preserve mankind, foment revolution, and ensure that nobody gains the
		an upper hand. After the Purge the GW agreed that they would not meet again
		for a long time and three of them would go underground. The Storm Lord,
		the Blade of Stone, and Tunbaxas. Falstaff would adopt a high
		profile. Tollen was known as the Gray One.  Ignatius was the
		Gray Wanderer known as the Ice Wolf.
		</p>
		<p>
		At this point we have five months to Gazadlath.
		</p>
		<p>
		We next head out to get a map of the path to Dao Sho.  On the way Erithmaen
		breaks up a fight between two merchants by flexing his aura. We make it to
		the mages guild. The attendant, a mage floating 6 feet above the ground,
		is gracious enough to entertain CatBird while Mordanith and the Orange Mage
		talk. After Mordanith gets the name of an excellent mapmaker and CatBird
		has grown tired of stalking the mage we head on. CatBird spends her time
		herding the group.
		</p>
		<p>
		We finally head to the MapMaker's Shop in the Sages District. We encounter a
		processional of the Sultan. Many humans with weapons and some
		human mages pass by. We get to the mapmaker's district and we find the shop
		of Mapmaker Aramar.
		</p>

		According to Aramar, ``The Citadel of the Seven is found in the northeastern wastes
		just to the north of the city of Kiev. We get a map that shows how to get to
		Dau Shao as well as a map of the area around the Citadel of the Seven and the city of Kiev.
		Aramar the mapmaker promises to refund the cost of the maps (7 gold) if we
		back with information about the area. The map cases are enchanted for
		protection against water and physical damage. 
		</p>
		<p>
		We next go to the animal area of the Bazaar. The Singing Warrior leads us to
		a dealer in exotic riding beasts. We settle on 12 Plains Cats. We promise the
		Pack leader that we will release them when we reach the plains of Dau Shao.
		We have the antiviolence bindings released. The other bindings are still in
		effect until we free the cats , at which time we will release the bindings.
		The dealer gives us the details of the bindings.
		</p>
		<p>
		We next purchase 50 skeins of silk and 2 skeins of silver thread. Erithmaen
		talks with his master about Cloth of Steel. One of the components is
		Giant Spider Silk. We pay for two suits of cloth armour from Erithmaen's
		master. One for the Singing Warrior and one for a robe for Morphus (Done up
		in heavy brocade). We buy enough material to make four additional suits of
		armour.
		</p>
		<p>
		CatBird buys some heavy leathers for the colder regions. Mordanith buys 5
		more silk robes. We buy dried fruits and vegetables.
		</p>
		<p>
		We then head to a tent seller and buy tents for the grup. Two 20' by 20'  by
		15' high with a controllled environment up to 130 degrees and down to -30
		degrees. Both have mana filters, compact into a small package and the
		materials are mana permeable. We also purchase two supply tents . 10' by 10'
		and weather proof. We get a large tent 40' by 30' for the cats. Erithmaen
		also purchases a mana lint collector.  It is a mirror with a crystal in the
		center. The crystal glows when it is full. Erithmaen knows how to clean it
		out.
		</p>
		<p>
		We pick up Arak. Anthea grants Mordanith the right to court her. Mordanith
		owes Anthea for the healing of Arak.

        We go to a sweet stand. Tev walks up in a
		long brown robe and a gray cloak. He looks like a wrinkled version of
		Charleston Heston.  He has two gaurdless knives.  He sits down to a stool next
		to Morphus. Morphus gives a signal to a higher initiate of the Order of
		the Rainbow. The term is ``Thalasa''( A place). Mordanith asks him his
		name. Tev asks ``Are you here to injure me in any fashion ?'' When we say no,
		he jumps away from the candy stand. He changes into a black cat. CatBird
		pursues him as Cheetah. Mordanith changes into a white panther. Morphus
		changes into a falcon. CatBird continues chasing him in Bird Form when he
		changes into a monkey.
		</p>
		<p>
		Tev leads us on a very  merry chase until Morphus summons us into a locale
		where we surround him. He agrees, under extreme coercion, to meet with
		CatBird and tell her want she wants to know.

		<date>Next Day</date>
		<p>		
        We go again to the upper markets of the Bazaar. We
		go to a thread shop. CatBird plays with the thread and exchanges insults with
		the merchant's imp familiar. Mordanith purchases 1000' of Star Sapphire thread.
		The merchant asks that we mention his name to those who deal in our travels.
		</p>
		<p>
		We visit several bookshops and Mordanith buys 4 texts on Will Working.
		We look for a book by ``Bagar the Elder'' . He is a master DreamWalker.
		Bagar is mentioned in a book Morphus
		finds by Muriel.  The group next heads to a shop that sells healing
		magic.  The shop is run by a priestess of Madras.  Mordanith greets the
		priestess with the bow of an older acolyte to a younger acolyte of her
		church.
		</p>
		<p>
		We buy a potion from the Church of the Law Giver. It restores an entity to its
		optimal state. An acolyte brings out a bowl of milk for CatBird. She also
		brings out Herbie the Plump White Furball. Herbie and CatBird carry on a
		learned discourse. We purchase 10 heal shape potions (5d/vial) and 2  vials
		of poison antidote (4d/vial). We get two bags of holding ( 40 lb
		limit).  They give us 6 gold tablets worth 100gp apiece.
		</p>
		<p>
		The group goes to the weaponers and orders a short sword and a polearm for
		Sigmund. Short sword is made of dwarven steel and modeled on a Tolnian
		thrusting blade. The polearm is 4' long, Dwarven steel. The weaponers sublet
		out their work to a dwarven smith.
		</p>
		<p>
		We then head to the Messengers temple to a holy book of the
		messenger for Sigmund. We get to the Messengers temple and the
		acolyte we meet at the temple tells
		us to come back later and talk to a high level priest. Morphus does some name
		dropping and shows him the Medallion we were given by the messenger. The
		acolyte pales and passes us on. We get the book.
		</p>
		<p>
		The group then heads over
		to a high elven shop.  Mordanith gets 200' of Elven Rope, a shaped necklace
		and a shaped cat toy.  The rope will only respond to high elven commands.
		Mordanith also picks up three bottles of Faer Han Air Essence Liquor.
		</p>
		<p>
		We then head to a shapechanger specialty shop.  The owner of the shop is a
		large, caustic, cigar smoker named Amak. Erithmaen and Morphus spend their
		time stariing at his wife. He loans us his nephew Malki as a guide.
		</p>
		<p>
		Meanwhile at the safe house: The guard brings books for Sigmund. Daryl,
		the head of the local thieve's chapter, comes in and talks with Sigmund.
		Daryl offers to sell off Sigmunds statuary (27 carvings ). They discuss how
		to get Sigmund out of the city. According to Daryl, Jarek Firelord's
		ambassador is furious about the theft of his gems. Daryl expects that the
		ambassador will be terminated in a week or two. He also mentionmes that the
		Red Sash do not always give full warning . Daryl continues Sigmund's
		training.
		</p>
		<p>
		Mordanith finishes with the Wards on the BattleMasters Buildings. Full
		protection for dvination/damage up to 2,000 points of power. He
		also finishes the wards on the hotel keeper's cart (500 points of Fire
		Damage).
		</p>
		<p>
		Erithmaen gets the Singing Warriors suit of Cloth Armor ( Black on Black ?).
		</p>
		<p>
		That evening, CatBird goes to meet Tev. Tev says that they are born.
		By the time puberty comes the ``others'' have gone from the mearest dreams
		to reality. Amak the Shapechanger runs a neighborhood in Marden.

		completed my task I will follow your mother''. ``Muriel shifts like the wind,
		I never know what form she will come in''.
		</p>
		<p>
		CatBird comes back and describes the conversation.
		</p>
		<p>
		Morphus goes to see Illia the Battle Mage. 
		They go to a play.  Morphus goes back to Illia's apartment and they have very
		rough sex all night long.  The next morning, Mordanith and CatBird are unable
		to get a hold of Morphus and have to go looking for him. The next four times
		Morphus goes on a date with her he gets introduced to much of the play crowd in
		Marden.  We head back to the inn and discover that the frankish priest and
		company are heading on despite our warnings and offers. Mordanith, annoyed,
		visits the temple of Corellan and talks with a priest of Labelas. The priest
		mentions that the church of Heimdell will be upset if Mordanith maims or kills
		the priest or paladin. Mordanith heads back to the inn and does a 450 point
		will working designed to prevent the priest and company from reaching their
		goal.

		We go to see Knowledge. We are called through to the prayer meeting.  We go
		to the prayer meeting room. We see Kevarian, the Godlet who accosted us in
		the desert. Mordanith and he exchange nods. Knowledge is small old man with
		a square cut white beard and close cropped hair. We get in a line in order to
		see him. Death and Justice are also there.
		</p>
		<p>
		Justice looks at Mordanith and tells him not to interfere with the priest
		and paladin. Knowledge comes over to us. CatBird, in cat form, asks if she
		has a forth form. He says she will be able to use it soon {\it This area of
		the tape was noisy, does anyone have clearer answers ?}.  Mordanith asks
		knowledge how the Wizard King's wards were originally designed. Knowledge
		claims that we have someone here who already knows.
		</p>
		<p>
		We go to see Arak. He has already left. Mordanith gives Anthea the
		shaped necklace and she gives him permission to court her.
		</p>
		<p>
		Erithmaen sends flowers to Amak's wife. A week before we leave.

		The monastery Sevaston  . We head through the
		garden district.  WE see a person shifting while walking. We see a number of
		poor people being herded off the grass. We see a thief booking  along running
		from some guards. We start heading into some poorer regions of town.  we see
		more abandoned temples. We smell decay and the stench of magic is much thicker.
		We see the usual scavengers....  We enter a completely unpopulated area.
		CatBirds memory starts to stir.  Malki  says
		that we are in the monastery region.  This is the area that you go to when you
		want to avoid the guard. It has a fearsome reputation . Vampires and ghouls
		have been seen.
		</p>
		<p>
		We see the monastery. CatBird starts remembering. She remember standing at
		this gate with someone . She remembers playing in the yard. There
		was a monk in rainbow robes. We are interrupted by sound above us.
		There is old magic all around. This was the site of a magic battle.
		Mordanith offers Malki magical protection, he declines.
		</p>
		<p>
		There are four towers around a central courtyard with walls.
		The sun is starting to go down. There are twenty foot walls
		crumbled around us. There are gargoyles 30' above us on the
		gateway walls. We head through the gate. We are being watched
		by someone or something above us. Golden Throat forces the gate
		somewhat open. We head through. Mordanith senses nothing
		with a mind in the immediate area. We look around. The group
		scans through SCF, KIF, awareness, sounds. Cat Bird shifts into
		girl.
		</p>
		<p>
		\begin{quotation}

		</p>
		<p>
		We see a fountain, broken, with a skeleton lying in the middle of it.
		CatBird heads toward the body. She stumbles on some rubble.
		</p>
		<p>
		\begin{quotation}

		</p>
		<p>
		\begin{quotation}
		{\sl {\bf Flashback}
		She is back in her room, she wakes to see Tev backed into a

		room.
		}
		\end{quotation}
		</p>
		<p>
		She comes back. Morphus detects a darkness in the bodies around us.
		There are undead gathering around us. the are minor minds but hungry.
		There is a dead thing watching us from the roof. Two leve;ls down
		there is a large powerful darkness. Mordanith insists that we fly out.
		CatBird shifts and takes wing. Morphus shifts to bird. Hawk is shifted to
		a conjuring circle. There are stone walls, a skeletal monk with
		rainbow robes he is pinned to the desk by a Dissenta sword. There
		is a slimy hole above here.  One of the walls has a crack in it.
		</p>
		<p>
		CatBird shifts to bird, she Dreamwalks back to us. As we lift we see a
		dark humanoid jump out from a wall at Morphus. It crashes into the
		fountain with a sickening thud. Another ghoul is vaporized by a light
		blast from the morphus/hawk's eyes. (Morphus, Tie Fighter). We
		levitate above into the setting sun. We head toward the garden
		district. We come down in a garden.
		</p>
		<p>
		An elderly mage in green robes comes out and offers us tea while he
		listens to our apologies. We exchange pleasantries and bid each other
		adieu. We pay the kid off and send him on his way. CatBird explains what
		she saw and heard. The Singing Warrior notes that he heard a young girl playing
		ball but he looked again and she was gone.
		</p>
		<p>
		We are interrupted by a visitor. We are visited by Estalsis.
		He asks about the power we have used.  He tells of permits for
		hunting in the district. He asks about Sigmund. He leaves.
		</p>
		<p>
		Mordanith suggests ripping the top off the tower and then
		blasting down the hole with the sunbane. Morphus doesn't want to
		because he wants to get some info out of it. Alex can't stop laughing
		about our style of adventuring. Most parties either sneak in or blast
		the door down. But these guys rip the dungeon roof off and dump a
		piece of the sun  down it and nuke it off. Mordanith loads up with
		2,500 worth of batteries.
		</p>
		<p>
		We go looking for a permit at 9 am. at the mages guild. A bored mage
		clerk suggests that we go carefully. It is a high mana zone. We get a
		AAA permit. We cannot level an area greater the a two block radius
		around the monastery and no aftershocks are permitted. We visit the
		demonologist of the mage guild. We glean little of real use.
		</p>
		<p>
		{\sc Called shot dark with SunBane at close range -60 at range  -120}
		</p>
		<p>
		We go in loaded for bear. We take rickshaws to the monastery.
		The Singing Warrior jumps out of the rickshaw and gets some flares.
		It will stay burning for 30 seconds , 3 heartbeats before it goes off.
		</p>
		<p>
		We pull up outside the garden district. We hire a guide who looks
		like a reject from the cast of ``Mad Max ''. Festooned with swords
		and daggers. He demands two gold up front. He leads us through a
		tunnel and then up into a cellar and we are there. He is going to
		stay in the cellar and watch us. Only a ``living'' thing can follow
		us back through the tunnel. He preps for fallout.
		</p>
		<p>
		Mordanith blesses his holy symbol (Go with the glow). Morphus
		dusts off his carpet bag.
		</p>
		<p>
		We advance out of the cellar towards the monastery.
		</p>
		<p>
		A small blond girl comes from around the corner. Mordanith sees
		only a 20 point creature of power (Maybe a life elemental.)
		She drops the ball she is holding, a sword stabs into her from
		behind.
		</p>
		<p>
		We walk into the courtyard.
		</p>
		<p>
		We hear a voice calling from the building ahead of us.

		</p>
		<p>
		The black robed body is the she saw killed.
		</p>
		<p>
		We see a child's skeleton. We see a body with a scorch mark
		near its body and it is pinned to the wall with a Dissenta
		dagger.
		</p>
		<p>
		Christine is standing outside the room. Darkness starts to rise up
		around her and focusing on her. Blood starts to leak from the wall.
		Morphus hits it with light. The darkness retreats. It appears very
		ordered. Christine runs down the hall. CatBird remembers that she and
		Maria roomed together.
		</p>
		<p>
		CatBird hears ``Talia, come and play''. We all spot her. Morphus holds
		life toward her and she becomes firmer. The dark starts to rise.
		Mordanith forces it away with light. Morphus offers her some
		life power and starts feeding her power. She becomes firmer. CatBird talks to
		Christine. Mordanith fences with the dark. Darkness starts to rise
		through the first floor.
		</p>
		<p>
		We release the ghost.

		CatBird goes to look at her room.

		pretty. She smile at CatBird and says ``hello child'' ''You don't seem

		<p>
		We are disturbed by the sound of an old man yelling up and saying
		``Hello, anybody there''. He runs when we yell back. Darkness begins
		to center on us and surround us. Morphus notes where four power
		anchors intercept the node lines under the monastery. Morphus
		attempts to check the condition of the wards of the monastery.
		</p>
		<p>
		\begin{quotation}
		{\sl {\bf Flashback}
		CatBird is five, and remembers a monk bringing her to a
		place with a mirror. Tev is next to the mirror and the monk says ``Are you sure
		?'' Tev hands her some jewelry and says that this is her soul and she should
		keep it by her. She does not remember having it at the Oriel monastery. The
		mirror was downstairs.
		}
		\end{quotation}
		</p>
		<p>
		Morphus starts connecting all the nodes. The dark recedes into the
		last anchor. Morphus fights mind to mind with the dark. Mordanith
		starts summoning power and runs for the tower door. Morphus continues
		to struggle with it. Morphus turns on the Wards. The wards contact
		Morphus and say that designated hostiles have been identified.
		Morphus authorizes countermeasures. Mordanith gets struck by a power
		arc. Mordanith is down 3 points of power and is down. He heads down
		the tower.
		</p>
		<p>
		Morphus keeps arguing with the ward which insists that its
		maintenance contract be re-evaluated. Extensive damage has been
		taken. Singing Warrior follows Mordanith down into the tower.
		The ring suggests
		looking in the library. The library says that all ``Divinatory
		functions are disabled''.Information sub-system comes online and
		says that ``The maintenance system is hosed''.
		</p>
		<p>
		Mordanith comes to a blank wall. The Singing Warrior comes running down.
		Morphus tells Mordanith how to open the secret doorway. There is a spiral
		stairway and Morphus talks Mordanith down the stairways. Mordanith
		preps the SunBane. The Singing Warrior runs back up the stairs.
		</p>
		<p>
		The ward asks permission to defend itself. Permission is granted but
		the protections are dead. Mordanith prepares to do a called shot
		darkness. He walks toward the room it is in. The dark abandons
		the anchor and floods toward Mordanith. Mordanith releases the
		SunBane and the little voice in Morphus's head goes ``EEK''. Mordanith is
		blown unconscious. The entire tower lights up. The Singing Warrior
		comes diving out of the tower smoking, blinking his eyes  and yelling
		``Too late !'' He then yells ``Shit'' and goes back in. He and CatBird
		go back down and pull Mordanith back out of the burning tower.
		Morphus tries to activate fire counter measures. The little voice in
		his head says to back off on that since ``Black hole, Wormhead will
		fuckin' try that for the rest of his life''
		CatBird leads Singing Warrior out. CatBird starts to cough and the
		Singing Warrior picks
		up both of us. Morphus telekinetically wakes Mordanith and he uses the Fire
		Globes to put out some of the fire.

		<p>
		{\sc Mordanith is 75\% wounded mental and physical.

		Morphus runs down the tower and puts out the fire. And then comes up
		and heals Mordanith. Mordanith offers up a small libation of Air
		Essence Liquor.

		We go and take a look at the library. CatBird recognizes this place.

		Erithmaen designs the Cloth Armor suits.
		</p>
		<p>
		Arak - Tunic; garnet, with obsidian trim.
		Leggings; obsidian.
		Possible Symbol of Arioch on it (raised weave). Possibly have Arak
		help with creation, add power.
		</p>
		<p>
		Erithmaeon - Robe; white opal.
		Very well woven, suitable for advertising. No "loose ends" to interfere
		with other weavings.
		</p>
		<p>
		Mordanith - Robe; star sapphire.
		Able to get along with Cloak.
		Very resistant to high power flows.
		Possibly have Mordanith help with creation, attune.
		</p>
		<p>
		Sigmund - Toga; smoky quartz.
		Very resistant to high levels of Earth magic. Able to survive the "
		Sigmund plane."
		</p>
		<p>
		CatBird - Tunic; tigereye, very silk-like, loose.
		Pants; dark citrine (brown), tougher weave, tighter. Both
		designed to "stretch" as she grows.
		</p>
		<p>
		I have listed them in order of difficulty, should probably be
		woven in roughly that order, so I will have higher skill levels for the
		trickier ones.

		<p viewpoint=Sigmund>
		Well, I don't know how much of a synopsis of last night you have
		received by now but I just want to stress one thing.  It's not my fault.
		Actually everything seemed to go quite well, everyone worked closely 
		together as a team and we were far more effective than anyone (especially
		alex) expected.  The one exception was morphus who (as usual) blew his
		own brains to pieces without any impact whatsoever on the opponent, although
		for a change he did not significantly harm any of the party members.  In 
		general morphus was the only casualty and there was nothing we could have
		done to prevent that (no matter how much firepower we had).
		</p>
		<p viewpoint=Sigmund>
		In any case here is a short summation of the results at the end of the night:
		o	Lythar is toast
		o	Paladin of Heimdal is dead but managed to get one good strike in -
		at his request we managed to arrange that he did not kick it
		while still in the Abyss.
		o	As a dieing act the paladin gave the sword "Deathbane" to Eoman
		(of course catbird gave it to him in the first place but it's
		the thought that counts)
		o	Singing warrior was completely uninjured (to my knowledge) and gave
		an extremely good accounting of himself.
		o	Morphus conjured what he thought was the orb of enchantment to himself,
		it ended up being an "Orb of Souls?" I don't know what that means
		yet.
		o	Otherwise everything went fine and we are just a little tired.
