q: Is it possible that Catbird is unconciously using the Gates of Chronos?

Anything is possible... but no, it is very unlikely.  She might be managing
to slip through the Gates and not be stopped by them.  They as much ward time and
space as control it.

q: Is it possible that the secondary ward placed on Morphus is
will magic ?

Yes.  It is also Abjurational - Warding mucho grande.

q: Do I remember any mention of Falstaff saving Tyriontill  from a raver

Yes. One of the Grey Wanderers- Known as the White Mage- fought the
Air Raver Oleanth who tried to link to Tyriontill and absorb him.  The White Mage
is said to be a Binder and a Willworker of some Power.
The White Mage and The Blade of Stone were said to often be at odds.  The
Ice Wolf and the Stormlord were other Grey Wanderers that were rumored or storied
to interact with the elves.

q: Now that I know which Vordak this is (Guards the Gates of Chronos, He who
>brought the Book of Winds back, etc..) can I figure out who else has summoned
>him.

 Not a chance.  Your lore of the Vordock is much to small.  This is a
BIG, and super unusually, powerful Vordock.  You think your summoning probably
should not have called one so powerful.


q: How easily cold the Vordak have mistaken Morphus's pattern for that of
>a dragon ?

 Unlikely.  You think Morphus' mind doesn't look anything like a Dragon's.


q: I get the impression that Kheldar may have done something to help
>initiate the original purge. Do I remember the names of any of those who
>did so ? Wh may have performed some heedless action and endangered or
>killed others ?

Yes. The Ice Wolf is said to havehad something to do with the orignal purge
but it was primarily, according to conservative elven scholars, the Blade 
of Stone that caused the Purge.  Others argue the "it was inevitable, 
and the Grey Wanderers did what they had to" argument.
The Lord of The Dorian Empire Chepu Akanasi was the first major Lord
to declear Purge.  The rest of the human world quickly followed suit.  
It happened fast- irrationally fast!  It was probably aided by 
external forces but noone knows who.

q: By Morpus's past memories I can guess that Morphus has been keyed
>to ABjuration in the Human manner. Is it possible that he has incorporated
>that key into himself ?

 Yes.  It seems almost certain that he has been keyed.  It is also possible,
though less so that he incorporated the Ke
y into himself.

q: Is there any quiet way for me to contact Lord Carolyn of the High Elves? Does he
>accept messages from Itinerate Wizards ?

 Pray.  Not usually!  A priest of Labelas is a likelier bet if you still
wanted to contact a higher up.

q: How does one break the connection between a Greater Dark and the
>Dark Mage controlling it ? Does the Sunbane have any effect on Greater
>Dark ?

 Kill the Dark Mage.  Destroy the material pattern of the control(there will
always be one).  Shape it out of existence.  Tear it up with a power attack.
 Yes, the sunbane effects them but they are so strong they can fight it.

q: Can a greater Death dodamge  to a FaerHan-Quenyan hald breed ?

 Only physical damage.  Its illusions and enchantments would be at half
effective against you, and its death attacks would not work.

q: Is there enough left to Tyriontil to communicate with ?
Yes and no.  There can be slow translated communication.  There are experts
at that process.

q: What is destroying the Linking Ward in the Hall of kings ?
>Is it likely that this only one of severallinking wards ?

 Hard to say.  Hard to say.  There are probably other linking wards.
