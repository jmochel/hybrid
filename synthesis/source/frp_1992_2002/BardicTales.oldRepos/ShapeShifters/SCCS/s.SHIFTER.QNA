Group Action Items
==================

[GA.1] Have all party members (especially Morphus) give everything 
they know the Wizard King. Everything ! What he wears for dinner 
etc...

[GA.2] Sigmund needs to get as much information as possible from 
Korketh, plus the two books we have on Sigmund's design. Especially 
aimed at improving his Sigmund lore and Sigmund Ops.

[GA.3] Improve our communication and cooperation during battle. 
Especially improve Kilsorana's integration with the mages in battle.

[GA.4] Get the knowledge of the Troll Sword to Vartigan

[GA.5] Get the damn holy-avenger to Pelleus.

[GA.6] Try ending the lifeline of the Dissenta captain before the 
battle.

Mordanith's Action Items
========================

[MA.1] Improve MCF Targeting

[MA.2] Figure out how the Vampire got through the wards
and how to counter it. If it is an anti-div perhaps a anti-div 
detecting trigger would counter it.

[MA.3] Figure out how to "Null-Power" hide the spell batteries

[MA.4] Talk to Abraxas about cat-birds no-power and producing a
similiar block.

General Questions
=================

[GQ.1] What are Deathlords ?
[GQ.2] What are DeathKnights ?
[GQ.3] What are Nazgul ?
[GQ.4] What kind of Fortu does the WK have ?
[GQ.5] What is Dreamwalking ? Should we try and track down the book 
about it by Bagar the Elder ?

[GQ.6] What Allies or Mercenaries can we get that would be useful ?
Look at this list and see if they work or don't work:

Dwarves
Na'Kor
Dalkan Samurai 
Thor (If he is not going to be there already can we bribe him with a
set of drinking goblets just like his old ones ;-))
Pentarrans - They have to be good for something 
Dullo's
KI Factor Shapechangers like the Red Guardsman
Tantir Guardsmen 
D'Jon
Darius
The Battle/Kinky Sex Mage of Marden
The Karestaen with CatBird's People
The Vordak

[GQ.7] What is the Orb of Souls
[GQ.8] What was the text of the agreement that bans the use of 
abjuration on this plane ?
[GQ.9] What is the usability of abjuration magic against wild magic ?
[GQ.10] What are our best methods of defense against the preceptors
I would especially like to cull information from Darius, The Vordack, 
and the Kerestaen.
[GQ.11] How does cat-bird's no-power work ? Is it related to what the 
vampire was doing ? Can it be applied to us ? Is there any 
information in Sigmund's books that will help. Or in the patterns 
that Erithmaen has memorized from Morphus's Personality Ring.
[GQ.12] Could we arrange to use the pattern (Tyriontil) to get into 
the site of the battle without noise ?
