Sanda,

Here is a list of Mordanith's various projects 
and where I think they are. I would ask that you tell me 
any details I need to worry about or role-play. I am trying to 
set myself up so that you have lots of hooks for me to fold in 
with the rest of the crew.

Strategic:
---------

Try to find out from Drellan why the Lich is taking Bengali and 
why he is using the Big Brother net. I need to find some possible 
reasons for this action and some good weaknesses I can exploit. 
My goal is the retaking and holding of the Tower of Temorth because 
I believe it to be a keystone of some sort for the big L. Can Drellan 
confirm, refute, or shed new light ?


Tactical:
--------

Project Morning Glory

	Set up the Sunflower modification. I believe that at this point I have 
	communicated with Madra and she is willing. We have not roleplayed it 
	but you have said that she is willing.  

	I would like to set up a process where the Sun-Warriors (the guild helps 
	distribute throughout their range).
	
	Is there any preferred way that Madra wants to perform the change ?

Project Ring-of-Fire:

	I believe that the first few should be starting up with Taliesin's rangers 
	and Rainbow monks at work. Human mages are to follow when I finish the 
	Human tailored cast.

	I figure it will be two weeks before the first small shipment will be available 
	for Adrian's troops or some of the player characters. Having the human tailored 
	version ready to go is a top priority.

Project Q:

	Start buying ships ( including the Golden Dawn ). 
		(The Golden Dawn purchase might be fun to run..)

	Find VERY GOOD Human Weather mages.

	Find best siege engine artificers that are willing to work 
	with new materials for using war machines off of boats. 

	Perhaps talk with Theruden ship captains.

	Try and arrange communication with a high level representative 
	of the Sea Elves.

Project Arnold:

	Talk to Domcho about advice on Martial Choreography and 
	best staff-as-art teachers.

Project Voice:

	Talk with the ESOM (Elven Society of Mages) about ritual design 
	for turning myself into a staff. I want them to take it on in it's 
	entirety including the fact that I want to time-hammer (i.e a single 
	word at the appropriate time should finish it.)

Project Sun Spot:

	Find out what Helios' problem is.

Project Life's Blood:

	Send an emissary to Tolnia representing a 
	consortium of Marden merchants. I will create one 
	if I have to. Try to arrange for favored trade status 
	on the basis of hiring a guaranteed number of Tolnians for 
	guards and laborers as well as a certain percentage of Tolnian
	suplies. In addition offer to help set up Tolnian/Dorean run Way-stations 
	along the way (With imperial taxes of course). In exchange I would like 
	to have only one low tax applied to the goods leaving Tolnia, with a 
	really cut rate applied to those goods needed for the fight against the 
	Lich. All contracts to be renogiated at Imperial pleasure once the
	Lich is defeated.
	
	Organize guards for protecting the Tolnian/Marden March.

	Talk with Sigmund about one way infonet.
	
	Finish run with Sirana and Richard.

Project Back-Bone:

	Coordinate the Sandwalker's People in Bengali and 
	Adrian's People (Flaming Swords).

Project Magnet:

    Talk with Silandra Mar about her role with the school.
	She should be showing up in the next day or two.
	
    Get the names of the 12 original archmage quality students

    Check on Markus

    Hand in review of first draft of Justicars Bylaws and Oaths.
	Notes on changes required to make oaths binding to elves.
		
    Do the bargaining deal with Black Guard.

    Set up the Follow-the-leader process for tracking Pheonix Sector
	Set up five man administrative team to aid and abet Peter.

    Set up commercial enclaves and bazaar outside the Marden River School.
        Want to assure that this area becomes commercial central.
        Assign someone to manage the whole process including policing aids
        (physical and Magical).
	If it would help I am willing to make the Marden Merchant Consortium 
	described in project Life's Blood the vortex of the Bazaar.
 
    See about arranging for a group of alchemists to come to Marden for 
    direct production for the war effort.

    Get copies of the undead lore texts from the Usulites.

    Arrange for group of (500) untainted barbarians to be trained in 
    Usulite anti-undead techniques for 6 weeks and then have them sell out to various 
    neighborhoods to help clean out undead to gain experience. I provide them with homes, 
    the base training, and upkeep and they keep the money they get from sell-swording 
    as long as they continue to train up their number to the full 500 and pay for their 
    own advanced training from the Usulites. We will give them a name and a chapter house. 
    They must forswear combat against humans except in self defense. We will give them a 
    formal oath and working so that their effectiveness against undead will be increased 
    over that of others. Look into the Usulites helping set up a permanent version of this.

    Pick up teachers from
        Venn,
        Dalkan,
        Relanian,
        Tolnians,
        Mayar Hillfolk

Project Flying-Stone:

	Lich bit searches (Book searches by the Usulites, Rainbow monasteries)

	<TOPSECRET>
	Start a study of Human Genetics and Set up a breeding program
	for the eventual defeat of Asmonar
	</TOPSECRET>

	Talk with Hollister about the Earl's Ride after the sword. 
	I am trying to find what indirect target I can send a Farm Team
	after that will influence this outcome.

	Look into current state of the First Farm team.

Project Ollee-Ollee-Oxen-Free:

	Talk with master Summoner about the possibility of adventuring with us.
