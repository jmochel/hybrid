This is a look at my proposed difficulty system.  I first saw this system in
Adventure Quest/Jaern, a fantasy RPG published by Lafayette Simulations, a
small game company out of Valparaiso, Indiana.  The game was released at GenCon
'91 this last August by the designers, Daniel Lawrence and Robert Blake.

This is what I'd call an inverse difficulty system.

Character stats are numeric (rated 0 to some number).  Task difficulties are
rated in terms of DICE -- an easy task might be rated "1d6" and a hard task
might be rated "5d6".

To resolve tasks, the dice described by the difficulty rating (e.g., 4d6) are
rolled and compared to the skill or attribute stat.

If the roll is equal to or less than the stat, the roll succeeds.  If the roll
is more than the stat, the roll fails.

I did some computer calculations to show you what the curves end up looking
like for various skill levels and difficulty ratings:

*100.0 means that the chance is close to,
but not equal to 100% due to rounding.

Example:

For instance, a character has a skill level of 10. The GM sets the difficulty
level for a specific task -- say he sets it at 4D6.  The player must roll 4d6
-- if the total is less than or equal to 10, he succeeds; if the total is
greater than 10, then he fails the task.

Looking at part of the table below, we can predetermine what the player's
chances of success will be.  Using the "10" row and the "4d6" column, we see
that the player has about a 16% chance of accomplishing the task (marked with
*asterisks*). If the GM sets the difficulty level lower, say at 3d6, the
player's chances will increase (in this case, to 50%).

11   100.0  97.2  73.6  33.5   9.8   2.0



Let me know what you think!  I think the system has incredible merit...
