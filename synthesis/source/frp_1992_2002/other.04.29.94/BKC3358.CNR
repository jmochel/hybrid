I'm of the opinion that we've got to draw the line somewhere.  I've previously
been of the opinion that we've been getting too specific; "Basis" is sticky to
pin down.  I think I saw six versions of good ole DEX rolling around at one
point.  I agreed that some specifying was needed (e.g., Manual Dex vs.
Agility), but that a limit had to be (albeit arbitrarily) set somewhere.
        This could develop into the opposite problem.  If we set absolutely no
attributes as sacrosanct, what are we actually *doing* at all?  We need to say
something to be useful.  I agree all GMs should take as much flexibility as
they need, but do we really need to give them something so amorphous as this to
begin?

I disagree.  In addition to my comment above, we need some kind of structure to
be of any use at all.  Structure is, by definition, the elimination of certain
undesired forms of flexibility.  I don't think we can have it completely both
ways.

Actually, I've been somewhat converted on this point, and discussed the reasons
why in a previous post.  In short: for our ease of design, It might be useful
to design one of the genre-modules first, to work out any bugs we might come
across as they appear.  So long, I say, as we can still extract the FRP module
when done.

I agree.

Where's our center, if we haven't a system-defining basis (sigh. catchterm.)
like attributes to start from?!?  If you can find a way around this that I'm
just missing through narrow-mindedness, please let me know ;-)}

I agree dice are too advanced and finicky a topic to work with now, but I've
made my position on attributes clear.

Murphy's Law corollary:
        You can please all of the people some of the time, or some of the
people all of the time.
        You cannot do both.

I don't want to sound too cynical, but what with all the well-thought-out ideas
floating about the list now regarding this one topic, I for one think it's time
to start consolidating, bearing in mind that as a group effort, compromises
will be necessary.  Kudos to all those who've contributed their ideas, and
let's keep this thing going!
