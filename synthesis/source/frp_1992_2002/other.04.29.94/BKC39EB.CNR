I'm not sure if sarcasm is healthy.

Of course they do, and I'm not suggesting that what is produced wouldn't.
Just that I believe its possible to allow a simple set to grow to more
complex sets (which can be provided as modules for simplicity).

Well, you're probably entirely correct.  *I* am still interested in a
scalable attribute system.  I'm not trying to rain on your parade, I'm just
talking about what I'm interested in.

Thats ok.  I still think its a great list.

No problem (see my response to Ursus).

I'm not trying to create a game that takes a lot of time, I just want to
talk about the underpinings of a modular system.  A GM doesn't have to
return to the ATOMS of the universe if s/he doesn't want to, just that I
would like to explore the possibility of doing that...

Again, you equate what I'm talking about as being a final product.  I'm
just talking about abstract levels because I find it interesting.

No problem.  Decide on that.  For what I'm interested in, it doesn't matter
to me.  What I was saying shouldn't get you upset.  I'm not trying to tell
you what to do.

If I had it all mapped out would I be wanting to work it out over the Net?
I guess I'm unsure of how to respond to the above.  Like I said in my
response to Ursus, what I'm interested in talking about should be seen
as threatening to the mainstream of what you are doing.  Maybe intially it
isn't as "pragmatic" or "practical" as what you are focusing on, but I still
think it is interesting and relevent.  I don't know what you mean about a
complex.  If you mean that game design interests me, and I have a view about
how it could be done, and I am persuing that view, then yes.  I'm not trying
to change or undermine your work.  As far as rampant ego... thats a little
strong.  Writing on the net can be difficult, especially when your trying
to communicate on complex topics, sorry if you interpreted that into my
trying to wrestel philosophical ground out from under your ideas (I'm not).

Ok. It fascinates me.

No.  I was being genuine (IE no hint of flame was intended).  I guess I'm
just a little frustrated.  I accept that.  I believed it was worth a try,
because I genuinely believe in the vision I have, as cloudy and abstract
as it may be.  I say "Am I dreaming..." because maybe it really is just too
hard a goal to try for.

Agreed.  100%.

Adam, hey I'm not doing anything bad, or hurting what your doing, am I?
I just am talking about what I'd like to talk about.  Thanks for listening
anyway.  THE GAME is not a single entity.  This is a living breathing
discussion.  Get serious about an aspect of it-Great! But other aspects can
still exist.
