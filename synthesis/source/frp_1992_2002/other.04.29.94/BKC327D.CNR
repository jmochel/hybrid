I don't think this is a bad trend at all.  Would you rather buy a system
that came boxed with a specific worldbook if you didn't want to run that
genre?  You'd be paying for a whole book that you'd never use.  I could see
including a sourcebook for genre-specific games like AD&D, but if I were
to buy a multigenre game I would want to pick a worldbook, not have one
forced on me.

I think what people are really complaining about is that "games are getting
more expensive."  Which is true, and it's bad, but it IS life.
