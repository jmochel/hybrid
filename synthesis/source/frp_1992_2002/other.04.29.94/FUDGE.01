The latest version of FUDGE is now released.  It is:

A) Posted to rec.games.design in ASCII format;
B) Archived in compressed, tarred format at two sites - see below.

I don't yet know if the GRASS version is up to date, however - I've
asked Loren Miller, but haven't given him enough time to answer, to be
honest.  At any rate, enclosed is the FUDGE FAQ.  The only answer I'm
currently unsure of is the GRASS-SERVER answer.

Enjoy!

FUDGE Frequently Asked Questions, Revised 12/7/93 (answers by Steffan
     O'Sullivan, sos@oz.plymouth.edu):

Q1.  What is the Current Version?
=================================
A1.  Version December 7, 1993.

Q2.  What is FUDGE?
===================
A2.  FUDGE is a free role-playing game (face-to-face table gaming, that
     is - not a computer game or Live Roleplaying Game).  It is just a
     gaming "engine" - each GM must provide the "body" of the RPG in
     order to make it work.  A certain amount of customization work is
     necessary in order to use FUDGE, and many things are left
     unstated: the GM will have to fudge a lot.

     However, it provides a simple, word-based mechanism for creating
     characters and resolving actions that is very easy to use in
     almost any given situation.

     FUDGE stands for:
     Freeform   (simple, laid-back, not rules-heavy.  Customizable to
		 taste.)
     Universal  (usable with any genre.)
     Donated    (it costs nothing, and may be reproduced and given to
		 players legally.)
     Gaming     (role-playing gaming, that is.)
     Engine     (it's just the basic mechanism for character creation
		 and development, as well as action resolution.  No
		 world details are provided.)

     [Actually, FUDGE can stand for other things, too: Freeform Universal
      Do-it-yourself Gaming Experience is a good one, for example!]

     FUDGE was written by, and is copyright by, Steffan O'Sullivan.
     Much valuable aid was received from many people on
     rec.games.design, most of whom are credited in the actual FUDGE
     manuscript.

Q3.  Who is the target audience?
================================
A3.  FUDGE is for experienced GMs, though it can be used with novice
     players.  You must enjoy making decisions on the fly in order to
     run FUDGE.  It's also not for those who want extreme detail.  You
     must enjoy either creating or adapting your own world background,
     as none is provided (but sample characters from a number of genres
     are included).

Q4. What genres is it for?
===========================
A4.  Any.  Of course, it hasn't yet been tried with *every* possible
     genre, so only time will tell if it really works with any genre.

Q5.  Where can I get it?
========================
A5.  FUDGE is available via anonymous ftp from:

     Site: oz.plymouth.edu
     Directory: pub/fudge

     It is in a single, compressed, tarred file called fudge.tar.Z.

     Ask your sys admin if you don't know how to ftp or extract files
     from a tarred, compressed file.

     Basically, after you get the file via ftp (be sure to enter "binary"
     before getting the file), you first uncompress it then untar it:
          uncompress fudge.tar.Z
          tar xf fudge.tar

     It is also available from:

     Site: soda.berkeley.edu
     Directory: /pub/fudge/rules

     At that site, it's called fudge.rules.tar.Z.

     Supplementary materials are available at soda.berkeley.edu, also, in
     the directories:

     /pub/fudge/options
     /pub/fudge/samples
     /pub/fudge/programs

Q6.  What if I don't have ftp capability?
=========================================
A6.  You have two choices.  You can get FUDGE from a listserv mailing
     list server: GRASS.  Simply e-mail:
     GRASS-SERVER@wilma.wharton.upenn.edu with a total message of:  get
     FUDGE.RULES You can get the addenda with a message of: get
     FUDGE-ADDENDA.RULES

     Your second choice is to buy a copy.  Send a self-addressed
     stamped envelope (use International Reply Coupon if from outside
     the USA) and a query for current prices to: Wild Mule Games, P.O.
     Box 838, Randolph, MA 02368.  Formats available:  IBM 360K disk or
     720K disk, Mac disk, and nicely typeset hard copy.

Q7.  Can I contribute?
======================
A7.  Yes, you can.  At this point, it would be very hard to get
     something in the main text - but not impossible.  If you find
     something grossly wrong, or seriously absent, let me know!  My
     main criteria for including rules are simplicity and necessity.

     It is easy to contribute to the Addenda, though.  I don't filter
     things.  Simply write a clear, concise rules addition, in ASCII,
     using existing Addenda sections as guidelines.  Upload any 
     submissions via ftp to:

     soda.berkeley.edu
     Directory: /pub/fudge/upload

     and send e-mail to appel@soda.berkeley.edu that incoming FUDGE
     material has arrived.  If possible, compress each file.  Although
     it may take only a few hours, please allow Shannon a day or two to
     move the material to the correct directory.

     Each submission should be clearly labelled as an OPTION, SAMPLE,
     or PROGRAM so Shannon knows which directory to put the material
     in.  Alternate rules and proposed changes are OPTIONS; lists of
     equipment or skills or powers are SAMPLES, as are new magic
     systems, psi systems, etc.  See the directories for examples.

     My thanks to Shannon Appel for for making this site available!

     If you don't have ftp capability, send submissions to:
     sos@oz.plymouth.edu

     (MS-DOS ASCII or XyWrite format submissions may be sent to:
      Steffan O'Sullivan, P.O. Box 465, Plymouth, NH  03264 USA.)

Q8.  Is the Name a Rip-off of The Amazing Engine?
=================================================
A8.  No.  It was developed before I ever heard of the Amazing Engine.
     FUDGE was first published in 1992, at least eight months before
     the Amazing Engine.
