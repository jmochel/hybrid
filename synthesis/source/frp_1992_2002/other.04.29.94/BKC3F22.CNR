Ok GUY!

Good post.  I am here submitting an alternate idea/proposal for contrast.
I haven't digested yours yet.  But LET THE GAMES BEGIN!

----

Ok.  This proposal centers around a MIND/BODY dualism.  Each character
attribute has both a MIND value and a BODY value.

For each attribute (both MIND & BODY) There are two values.  One represents
the current characters ability under ideal conditions one's POTENTIAL, the
other represents the current ability under the CURRENT situation (IE injury,
mental fatigue etc.)  Potential can increase during the course of a game
analogous to experience points.

The attributes I picked are simply the choices I had made in previous years.
They are subject to negotiation (as is everything).  The numbers are simply
numbers, as scales we haven't figured out anything yet.

EXAMPLE:

      MIND                  /                BODY

current potential       ATTRIBUTE       current potential

50      75              INTELLIGENCE    55      80
75      80              STRENGTH        68      70
68      77              CONSTITUTION    34      57
10      39              BEAUTY          25      32
69      69              AGILITY         40      45
30      30              DEXTERITY       12      26
4       5               WISDOM          18      29

Couple of comments:

MIND values are meant to represent knowledge or skill about an area/attribute.
BODY values are meant to represent the physical ability of the body (or brain).

So..

MENTAL INTELLIGENCE: Knowledge of logic/reasoning ability...
BODILY INTELLIGENCE: Structure of the Brain to reason, memory power etc.

MENTAL STRENGTH: Knowledge of the application of strength and leverage.
BODY STRENGTH: The body's capacity for power strength etc...

This is just an outline to start a conversation of these ideas.  The hope with
the current example of its application, is that with a set of attributes
in both MIND/BODY you can create an refer to any quality a character might
have by looking a some combination of the attributes given.

In glancing (and I mean glancing) at Guy's post, he has things like Willpower
and Passion.  These could very well be added to the above example if desired.
But they could also be infered from given attributes.  Willpower is the
combination of MENTAL INTELLIGENCE & WISDOM with the BODY INTELLIGENCE & WISDOM
to carry it out.  Passion could be MENTAL WISDOM & BEAUTY... just thoughts
but you get the idea.

One final comment.. Things like Willpower & Passion I tend to think of as in
part of ROLEPLAYING.  That isn't to say I'm against having attributes like
that, only that with the concept of scalability we might want to get a list
of SETs of attributes that could be incrementally applied.

Like the first set is:

        STRENGTH        ala TWERPS

second set is:

        STRENGTH
        AGILITY
        CONSTITUTION

third set is:

        INTELLIGENCE
        STRENGTH
        CONSTITUTION
        BEAUTY
        AGILITY
        DEXTERITY
        WISDOM

fourth set is:

        WILLPOWER
        INTELLIGENCE
        STRENGTH
        CONSTITUTION
        BEAUTY
        AGILITY
        DEXTERITY
        WISDOM
        PASSION
        SELF

and etc....

These are just examples of the types of sets we could create.  One tool
that would be very usefull is a tool to convert from one set to another.
We need our points scaling system to build that tool I think.
