********* Comment on attributes...

     I think the attributes should be above all else easy to understand.  In
fact it should be the easiest thing to understand in the whole system.  For
that reason (and really, only that reason) I'd prefer to stay away from the
mind/body concept and keep with more easily identified attributes.

*********  Open questions...

Brian (BM5371A@DRAKE.BITNET) asks:
     "BIG QUESTION ON ATTRIBUTE SYSTEM:  Will it be a randomly generated
     attribute system (a la D&D and Rolemaster) or a player-chosen system
     based on points (a la GURPS and HEROSystem)???"

     I think we could have both.  I'ld propose the following three methods of
character generation (the choice would be up to the player, though the GM has
the option of not allowing a method to be used in his/her campaign):

     a) Roll #d# per attribute.  Then move them as desired if you
          have a character in mind.
     b) Roll #d# total die.  This is the total number of points you have
          to be split amongst the attributes as you see fit.
     c) Each player gets # points to be split amongst the attributes as
          they see fit.

     I really don't see a conflict here.  The second sentence I don't really
understand:

          "I think that this will be important to decide early because it
          will determine whether we need to decide the costs of skills and
          the like (in points) or set up tables for random generation."

     What tables do you need for random generation of attributes??

Greg Porter says:
     "As a general note on how finely you wish to split attributes, it makes
     a big difference on whether skills are "skill-driven" or "attribute
     driven"."

     I get your point.  I've never seen a system that was so skill-driven
that it didn't matter at all what attributes you use (I have never played
your game, sorry).  I think as long as it could give you a +1 to the skill
(whatever that means in the system), the dex needs to be split.  If the
attributes don't affect the resolution of action at all, then maybe we should
not have attributes.

*********  New Comments...

     As much as I like the comments about increasing skills through use (as
opposed to xp), I want to point out that if we go that route, we need to
develop a mechanism for learning new skills during play.  I'm not necessarily
opposed to it, but I think we need to discuss that a bit before we decide.
Actually I like the concept of getting better at something through use, but
there also needs to be a way of picking up new skills (and improving existing
ones for that mater) through instruction.

     I also think that the attributes should be able to change over time.
I'd like to see (and so I'm proposing) that the character be allowed to take
instruction in or perform activities that can increase attributes.  As an
example I recently decided to take a t'ai ch'i class.  If I learn it well, it
will improve my agility (thanks for supplying that term!).  Likewize, someone
could take wieght-lifting to improve their strength.  There may not be
"classes" for all the attributes, but at least those two should be worked in.

     I thought of a new attribute as well.  It's another Con derivative.  How
about Endurance?  Resistance and Endurance are surely seperate things, right?
I mean Endurance here to measure how long a person can continually perform a
physical activity.  Like:  your agility and strength let you move at 5 meters
per round; but your endurance lets you do that only for N rounds.  I may be
complicating this too much.
