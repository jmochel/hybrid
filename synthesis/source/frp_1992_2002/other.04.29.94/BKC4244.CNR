I haven't been following this thread too closely but I don't think anyone
has suggested this.  Some of the games currently out there, Harn being a
perfect example, have the problem of calculated scores and stats and
defense values and so on.  For those who haven't played Harnmaster, the
basic idea is: you generate about 10 character attributes randomly.  You
then go through a process involving a lot of table lookups and calculations,
but very little actual decision making.  The benefit of all this setup time
(requires several hours to create one character) is that the Harn game system
can handle a lot of complexities and yet in itself it is very simple.  All
the calculations and table lookups have already been done so you don't have
to do them during the game.  (Compare this to AD&D:  simple set up, but
"Uh, I need a 15 to hit, but this sword is +2 when fighting creatures larger
than human size, and I'm a dwarf so the giant has -4 to hit me, and there's
a Bless spell in effect for 3 more rounds so that's +1..." not actually
very simple.)

The only drawback in the Harn system is the amount of time needed to create
or modify a character.  If there were a computer program which could handle
this (and if anyone knows of one for Harn please tell me!) that difficulty
would vanish.  Type in your scores, choose some skills from a menu, and
poof, you have a character.

I think that computer character generators may be a solution to the problem
of complexity vs. functionality.  Naturally, there are a few problems.

1.  Not all gamers have access to a computer.  I would guess that a very
    large percentage do have access or could get access, especially since
    most colleges have computer labs which are generally available to
    students.  I think within 10 years, provided the economy survives, that
    there will be very few people who do not have access to a computer of
    some sort.

2.  Difficulty in modifying the system.  It's hard to add another stat, as
    most GM's will do at one time or another, or additional specialized
    skills, if the character generation system is based on a program.

There are probably more problems that I haven't thought of.  (Well like for
instance who's going to write the thing.)

Obviously it's not a good idea to develop a game which requires a character
generator.  But it might be good to keep in mind how the availability of a
computer could improve the game, without the GM's having to do a lot of
programming.  (Consider the interest in a GURPS character generator a while
ago.  I would certainly fork over some bucks for a Harn character generator
if Columbia could make it available.)
