I have to agree.  Though experienced, I am far from an expert game designer.
I would have to consider myself an amateur also.  I feel that trading ideas
and generally helping out when others need help is a great idea.  I am
currently compiling a list of all the people who have replied saying they are
into game design.  The list includes names and IDs.  Next week sometime I will
post this list to GMAST-L.  In you want to be on the list but have not
replied concerning designing games, just write.  I will try to get everyone,
but I may miss a few people.

Heck, maybe we could even get crazy and design a game on-line!
