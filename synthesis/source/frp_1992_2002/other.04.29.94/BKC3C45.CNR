The Gaming Community is small, and most people know people who know
people etc... If a FREE game is available sooner of later everyone
will want it (if it is good that is). It will be up to the network
users to promote the game. to their friends and so on... People might
make a buck but not for long... No one wants to pay for something
they can get for free.

I agree making it free makes it harder to steal.  Electronically, this is
no prob.  But, say someone takes the electronic text, prints it out in a
pretty format, and then begins selling it in stores to all those poor
unfortunates without Net access?  That is what I was worried about.
