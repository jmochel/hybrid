Re: Jeff's (TOLLEJX%UNCG.BITNET@uga.cc.uga.edu) proposal to not have
     attributes just have maneuver skills in agility, strength, memory, etc.

     I'm not necessarily opposed to this concept.  There is an elegance to
it.  And it's definitely expandable.  The big question I have is how do we
resolve unskilled maneuvers?  For example, my character has no
agility-releated skills at all.  Nothing, zero, rein.  He finds himself
needing to just a 1 foot wide crack.  How do I resolve this?  Does he always
fall in?  Is there some minimum distance that even an agility(nil) character
can jump?  (I get the mental image of a Gumby from Monty Python here...) In
this case is there a minimum amount of information a memory(nil) character
can recall?  How much can a strength(nil) character lift?  etc.

     If we require all characters to spend at least one point in each of the
top-level "skills" so we can resolve "default" situations, how is this
different than attributes (stats which everyone has vs skills which everyone
must purchase)?  Other than verbage that is.

     The only other concern I have is that the relationships begin to get
complex.  Concider:

     * If I take eye-hand-co-ordination(7) am I as good at shooting a pistol
       as someone with pistol(7)?

     * Do we devide the skill by 2 for every level from the "leaf" skill to
       the closest skill the character actually has?

     * Are "parent" skills absolutely required to purchase "child" skills (do
       you have to purchase eye-hand-co-ordination before you can purchase
       pistol)?

     * And what about relative skill level of parent-child skills?  Does the
       top have to be the best?

     * Or do we model the overcoming of poor eye-hand co-ordination with
       practice at a specific skill (what do you do with activities like t'ai
       ch'i which should improve the higher-level "skills" but should also
       have a value of it's own to measure how well you can perform the
       sequence?)?

     There's a lot to think about...
