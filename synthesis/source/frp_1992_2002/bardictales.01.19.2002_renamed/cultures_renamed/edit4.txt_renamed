JimJacklM: DalKan vocabulary questions ?
DragonSoaring: Ask...
JimJacklM: Chohan, Johan, Gohan ?
DragonSoaring: Chohan
JimJacklM: And chohan command how many ?
DragonSoaring: Or rather- Cho-Han (two characters
DragonSoaring: A Cho-han can command up to 50 Samurai and up to 1000 Bushi.
DragonSoaring: But those ar ehigh end numbers.  The Dal-Kon don't usually have Big armies.
JimJacklM: Any other ranks other than Daimyo I should know about ?
DragonSoaring: A Daim-yo can have as few as three Cho-hans and as many as twenty if he is insanely powerful.  
DragonSoaring: The Daim-yo that is your host- (The p;adin of Heimdell) has 14.
DragonSoaring: I folow your lea don the question odfother ranks...
JimJacklM: Have you thought about by Shogun suggestion ?
DragonSoaring: You are the Dal-kon student right now! :-) 
JimJacklM: lol
DragonSoaring: I don't understand about YOU starting aSHogunate.
JimJacklM: no no no :-)
DragonSoaring: How would YOU have the EMporer selct you for that poosition?
JimJacklM: No I meant that I, Jim, was strating a concept called a shogun for DalKan
DragonSoaring: I like the idea- and it can be implemented as you sugessted and I am ofr their having been one or two in the past.
DragonSoaring: PLease go wild!
JimJacklM: Menahan is not Shogun material
JimJacklM: !
DragonSoaring: I give you liciense (though I of course retain editing and veto rights!) :-)
JimJacklM: what a suprise 
JimJacklM: :-
JimJacklM: :-)
DragonSoaring: My thinking was that a really big army would have 
JimJacklM: Holly is planning on giving it a very thoroough once over !

DragonSoaring: Samurai (that can control 20 - 200 Bushi)
DragonSoaring: CHo-han that can contro up to 50 Samurai and have their own 20-200 Bushi
DragonSoaring: Daim-you would have 3-20 Cho-han
DragonSoaring: Ther ewould be thirteen Daim-yos in Dalkon and one Emporer.
JimJacklM: 13 Daimyos ? 
DragonSoaring: I have mad ehtis up- itn is not becadon any research on my part except maybe memory of books I have read.
JimJacklM: Hmmm. 
DragonSoaring: Too many or too few?
JimJacklM: Daimyos act as clan heads ?
JimJacklM: To few.
DragonSoaring: Clan heads could be Daim-yos - rthere are way more Clanheads than there are Daim-yos
DragonSoaring: SOme CLanheads ar eonly Samurai.
DragonSoaring: or "only" Cho-han.
DragonSoaring: Does that make sense?
DragonSoaring: Maybe it should be 23 Daim-yos
DragonSoaring: or 30?
DragonSoaring: WHat do you think?
DragonSoaring: I haven't enumerated them yet.
JimJacklM: let me think about that. I am drastically simplifying the count from the Japanese but I have figured on 90 odd clans each with 2-7 lines answering to them.
DragonSoaring: Hmmmm...... I was thinking that there were three- four million Dalkon in the world.
DragonSoaring: What would that imply?
JimJacklM: Did daimyos result from people establishing protection over groups of other dalkan ?
DragonSoaring: Yes.
JimJacklM: that some clans are very large.
DragonSoaring: And form Emporers granting certain Dal-Kon over acrhing authority. 
JimJacklM: then there must bne some close to one to one mapping between Daimyos and regions . You have DalKna brokjen up into some damn small islands.
DragonSoaring: Hmmm.... Nod. 
JimJacklM: Why not go with the concept of lesser and greater daimyos
DragonSoaring: Well- I figur ethere are 5-10 thousand Dal-Kon in Begalli.
DragonSoaring: Maybe 2-3 thousand in TOlnia
DragonSoaring: I have no problem with greater and lesser Daimyos.  Or even if you ocme up with a mor ehistorialc accurate title for a "lesser Daimyo that is okay.
DragonSoaring: Maybe ther eare only a million Dal-Kon. 
DragonSoaring: Oh well- I hsould get bnack to work./ 
JimJacklM: ok. Tell you what. Lets assume 3-4 million for now. Also, I am assuming that DalKan is fertile but treacherous. Let me work out the numbers based on that and the land area of DalKan on the map . Does that work ?
DragonSoaring: That is fine.  I ouwld love it if you could do that !  
JimJacklM: ok
JimJacklM: done !

JimJacklM: well . Started anyway
JimJacklM: lol
JimJacklM: ttyl
DragonSoaring: OKay.  I am thinking about righting anothe rstory for the Pelleus run- about the upcoming fall of the SunLord Citadel. 
DragonSoaring: What do you guys want to do on Satruday's run?
JimJacklM: hmmm. I have no idea.
DragonSoaring: Wher edid we leave off with SHifters?
JimJacklM: I will only be there between 12:1`5 and 6:30 so whatever we do you may want to plan on that
DragonSoaring: Okay.  
JimJacklM: we had just done something quickly 
DragonSoaring: Do you remeber what happend last run?
DragonSoaring: ???

JimJacklM: Vampire popcorn ?
DragonSoaring: NOOOO!  
JimJacklM: Wasn;'t that the last run ?
DragonSoaring: Are you saying the last run was the run ...ohhhh... it was thr un AFTER you ripped the roof off the Vampire temple.  You guys went into the halls and went to that idsland...
DragonSoaring: The Nazgul showed up and the dragons
JimJacklM: yup
JimJacklM: I think, that was the last one
DragonSoaring: O=kay - it is starting to ocme back to me...
DragonSoaring: Jesus!
JimJacklM: what ?
DragonSoaring: AFter a long period of intermittant running I have for some reason run a lot in the last two months and the story lines ar ebblurirng for me.
JimJacklM: lol
DragonSoaring: SHiftewrs is about to get sucke din in a big way I think. 
JimJacklM: please let it stay on this plane !
JimJacklM: oh lord 
DragonSoaring: Things have transpire din thew world and the War to end all Wars ha skjust picked up speed.  
JimJacklM: Oh frumious joy
DragonSoaring: It is all because of one PC committed to he rhusband and his people not being sacrificed by the mor eintelligent stratgey.
JimJacklM: and this is a problem ?
DragonSoaring: It is foolish to draw the line in the sand in Dau SHoa but by convincing Dora to ocnvinc ethe Dwarves to march and fight there she has forced the Allies hand 
DragonSoaring: Kay's plan was FAR more cautious and far wiser with FAR higher chance of success
JimJacklM: LOL
JimJacklM: And can't Kay convince anyone of this yet ?
DragonSoaring: HIs plan was pull people back form Daushoa and form a defense line on the Kestor /Heimdella line.  
JimJacklM: Well. Just defend Kestor and start calling it a defense in depth.
DragonSoaring: NO everyone is convinced.  But Dwarves ar ethinck headed.. and DOra basically said that this is where the action is and that these people ar ebaout to be wiped out and have their cities destroyed by the Licj./. The Dwarven kinfg decide dit was a good way to prove Dwarven superiority
JimJacklM: The dwarven king makes Gimnli look like a genius
DragonSoaring: MOstly because Sterling convinced DOra it would be immoral to abandon Woodshome and Kiev to the undead.
JimJacklM: So Sterling has the brains of an ice cube.
DragonSoaring: NO- he just has an unbelievable confidence in the strneghth of his army and DOESN'T QUITE GETT HE SCALE OF THE ENEMY.
JimJacklM: LOL

DragonSoaring: He also assumes his action will force the hands of the allies and have them join him./
JimJacklM: Dwrves get stuck on your shoes when you step on them.
JimJacklM: Well. In a weay it will
DragonSoaring: He is accurate.  Don't tell anyone but after a fruitless argument to try and change their mind Kay is ordering the entire feudal host to join Dora's ragtag army.
JimJacklM: But it will stractg rthe allies out of all reason.
JimJacklM: Well. I hate to warn you but Menhanan is starting to think that maybe he has to start taking chances for himself. He is begining to assert himself.
JimJacklM: My boy is growing up.
DragonSoaring: NOd.  Kay is working hard on a plan to force the Lich to ocmmitt his forces elesawhere so that the other forces can join the Dau-Shoan fornt without facing the Lich's entire army. 
DragonSoaring: I will give Jack this-0 he is agoods srategist.  He has come up with a convincing strategy to make theis "problem"  possibly work.
JimJacklM: This messes up the timetable for getting the lich bits doesn't iut.
DragonSoaring: All it will take is certain armies facing an unbeatbale foe in impossible odds...
JimJacklM: Thats the spirit !

DragonSoaring: Well- that is all about to beocme moot on the 30th...
JimJacklM: which is going to become moot the lich bit timetable or the strategy ?
DragonSoaring: Kay is now banking on that the only to face the Lich's UNBEATABLE numerical superioriy (about 1000:1)  is to destroy the Lich himself  and therebye his generals and amries against each other. 
DragonSoaring: The timetable. 
JimJacklM: joy. 
DragonSoaring: If Pelleus is succ on the 30th he may have the Lich's heart mostly assembled !
JimJacklM: Pelleus just got a logistics and support boost !

DragonSoaring: Exactly- hence the plaot devioce gatheirng all the heros around Pelleus' importnat but not time-critical quest.
JimJacklM: Well. Shifters can tell him where the parts are :-)
DragonSoaring: Not time-critical until now!!!!!
DragonSoaring: YOu gotta love it when a lack of plan comes together!
JimJacklM: yup
JimJacklM: It has that half baked genius that smells of improvisation (aka Desparation
DragonSoaring: ALso- the slip that is going to happen will be that the balance - for once - is oing to be fthrown in favor of the allies.  
DragonSoaring: LOL
JimJacklM: because of the lichs attempt to recover from his back blast ?
DragonSoaring: ONe of the Lich's generals; the Lord of theNazgul Herun- is going to use overwhelmeing force and surprise and trickery and is going to take the SUnLord's Citadel.  
DragonSoaring: Successfully. 
DragonSoaring: However this will invoke the Balance BIG TIME! 
DragonSoaring: BEcaus ehe will use an "illegal" concentration of Divine fore to isolate and lovcate the CItadel on the PLane of Neutrality.
JimJacklM: ah. Now is the SunLord citadel the locvation of the teleopprt chanmber ?
DragonSoaring: He is doing this to trap and kill the SUn lords that are there.  This mostly fails (with some heart-wrenching fatalities and heroics though) 
DragonSoaring: Yes it is....
JimJacklM: fuck.
DragonSoaring: That event will happne right before your run on Saturday- that is why I am telling you! :-)
JimJacklM: no biggy for Mordanith (as such , though it bites) but Menahan will be grumpy.
DragonSoaring: WHat Dau-Penn does to restore the balance is give Pelleus the location of cap stone of the Lich's heart. 
JimJacklM: Yes. I lovbe that Lizard !

DragonSoaring: He also will provide proetection for the hero gatheirng process that will lead to a party gatheirng around PElleus so that the Lich is not forewarned.
DragonSoaring: ALl using the Power of the Balance so being undetectable- even to the Greater Gods. 
JimJacklM: Perty at Dau-Penns !
JimJacklM: Not that Correlan would kick about it :-)
DragonSoaring: \I am thinking the run may start with you being contacted by the Fat Snake himself...
DragonSoaring: He needs Allandi in the party because any of the Fated can be traced.
JimJacklM: Most fun. My Draconic is a 12 now so I would love to talk with hum !
DragonSoaring: Does that sound like fun?
JimJacklM: Sure. whats a little more chaos for life
DragonSoaring: Well-= you guys were just putzing around Empire building anyway. 
DragonSoaring: It will also be the mechanism by whcih Lara, Matt and Laird get peeled off . 
JimJacklM: Please, I prefer to think of it as establisghing a logistics base.
JimJacklM: lol
JimJacklM: cool.
JimJacklM: Can Verun come ?
JimJacklM: :-)
DragonSoaring: When you find the capstone (I am optimistically assuming you guys will be succsasful though I am prepare dfor the alternative)
DragonSoaring: It will lead you ot be able to decipher one of the clue sthat you have and Laird, matt's new charascter and Lara will go questing for it.
JimJacklM: cool.
JimJacklM: Thoughthis does kill my plan to train with Domcho, unless I can squeeze time a little.
JimJacklM: sigh
DragonSoaring: Verun may hjopin you as a rep form the COuncil that Estalsis assigns to work with you Mordanith.
DragonSoaring: Menahan or Mordanith?
JimJacklM: Mordanith
DragonSoaring: Mordnaith was going to trian with Dam CHo?????

DragonSoaring: IN what?
JimJacklM: What is Domcho's rank in Katana ?
DragonSoaring: Arken's codpiece- high. I odn't know.
JimJacklM: Mordanith had a talk with DomCHo remember ? About training in the art of STaff.
DragonSoaring: Oh yeah!!!!!!!!
DragonSoaring: Now I remeber!
DragonSoaring: Sortry- getting old!
JimJacklM: I ma just wondering if Menhana was closing. It just reached 15 with the eeps from the last run.
DragonSoaring: You are RNAK 15 in Katana!!!!!!!  That is insane!!!!!
DragonSoaring: You are better than he is.
JimJacklM: Really ? Awesome. 
DragonSoaring: I think he is a "mere" 13 and change.
JimJacklM: lol
DragonSoaring: I ouwld have to ifnd him- I can't find ANY ANY of my gaming stuff Jim!
JimJacklM: But I have noticed that his HTH is not much less either.
DragonSoaring: I odn't know weheer eI put it...
JimJacklM: There were two boxes. One full, one partial
DragonSoaring: I think somebody (SARA) clenae dit up osmepkace but she doesn't remeber and I can't find it!
DragonSoaring: It is driving me carzay!  I know it is here somewhere..
JimJacklM: no prolem. we will dig it out.,
DragonSoaring: Yes- his HTH and Defense are WAE-INSPIRING- probably also in the 12 and 13s.
DragonSoaring: He can wlak thorugh a fihgt and just not get hit...
JimJacklM: What is your typical silver tassel ?
DragonSoaring: Wouldn't you like to know.
DragonSoaring: :_0
JimJacklM: &^*%^&$%^*%^&^&* !!!!
DragonSoaring: With a 15 though you can beat tyou typical silever tassel.  You are definitely better than the average silver tassel.
DragonSoaring: Howeve rthe upper management is probably AT your leve;l or close to it
JimJacklM: nowe I have to start develoiping a HTH set as a style 
DragonSoaring: That is the scary part they are not better than you- they just are in your range!
JimJacklM: Well. Menehan was raised as a weapon.
DragonSoaring: Though there perceptions skills are awesome!
JimJacklM: Yeah. I am still working on getting in the ballpark of good with perceptions
JimJacklM: are suilver tassels typically strong in Ki ?
DragonSoaring: Yes- they are all at least 30 KIF.
JimJacklM: Good.
DragonSoaring: Ik now you laugh at that again- you are better than your average silver tassel in every 
EVERY way except perhaps for perception and the specific find hidden and assaassin sighting skills.

JimJacklM: SO how likely is it that Menahan can actually talk to his great grandfather ?

DragonSoaring: I think we will need to role-play that out.
DragonSoaring: 8-)
JimJacklM: :-(
JimJacklM: I fuigured.
JimJacklM: You know, if menehan
JimJacklM: ever takes the clan 
DragonSoaring: Silver Tassels mind resistance is among the best- designed to thwart Rhelanian enchanter snad illusionists.
DragonSoaring: If you take sthe clanm- you will probbaly be able to:-)
JimJacklM: I realkly pity the clan's sensibilities.
DragonSoaring: HAHAHAHA
DragonSoaring: OKAY back to owrk with me.
JimJacklM: ok.
JimJacklM: have fun. see ya tomorrow
