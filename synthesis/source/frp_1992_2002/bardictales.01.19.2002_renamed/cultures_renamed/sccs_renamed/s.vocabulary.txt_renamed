Great Walk = the "great" part is easy... "dai". the "walk" part is harder.
I'm thinking it may be closest to "journey", a good nuance of which for
these purposes is "enro" or "long road". So I'd go with dai-enro (lit.
"great long road")
Inner Clans = 
Outer Clans = 

Having real trouble with the clans. I'm pretty sure there are terms for
these concepts, but I can't find them anywhere (yet ;)

I would use something like "uchihan" (lit. "inner clan") and "gaizoku" (lit.
"outside tribe")

Great Walk = which meaning of "great", "wonderful", "big", or "honorable"?
does walk mean something you take or a walking path?
Inner Clans = does "inner" refer to geography or relationship?
Outer Clans = see above
Code of Order (maybe Code of Proper Behavior ?) = houten (lit. "code of
law", the "ou" denotes an elongated "oh" sound)
Imperial Family = kouzoku
Family = kazoku
Line (or extended family) = kakei (lit. "family lineage") is probably what
you're looking for, but there are a bunch for this one. e.g. "bumon" is a
samurai's lineage, and "ikkei" is a single-family lineage.
Clan = kamon (lit. "family tribe") (although, as a suffix, it's "-han")
Head Of Family = souke
Mother of the Family = okaasan
Head Of Line = taiso (lit. "founder, progenitor")
Mother of the Line = jotaiso, assuming the previous entry is assumed to be
the male equivalent of this
Head Of Clan = shuryou (lit. "chief")
Mother of the Clan = oyabun
Roles = hinsei (lit. "character") (Japanese doesn't do much in the way of
explicit plurals)
Speaker with another's voice (Herald?) = denreisha (lit. "herald, orderly,
messenger")
Blood Relations = kotsuniku (lit. "blood relations") or chisuji (lit. "blood
relationship")
"Necessity Exists" = hitsuyou ga aru (literal translation, would work in "real" Japanese)
"Hand Signals" = teshingo
