Dal-Kon Proverb: "To be clanless is to be dead"

Much of the complex social behaviors of the Dal-Kon can be tied to the shared 
experience of the diaspora or "Great Walk". 

Being hunted by many Golden Empire opponents as well as the hazards of the trip 
itself welded a predominantly warrior slave culture with an intense hatred of 
dictatorship into a common body with conventions and codes designed around 
survival.

The first basic codes were put together by the 40 odd largest intact slave 
regiments. These forty eventually became the foundations of the Inner Clans. 
They were written on a wide variety of media and were a combination of 
"lifeboat" survival rules and rules of order for arbitration among the forty.

These codes were elaborated upon through the trip and the century or so of 
settling in Dal-Kon. Eventually there came into being a group of inter-related 
codes. They govern the three major sub-groups within Dal-Kon: The Imperial 
family, The Inner Clans, and the Outer Clans.

Within the codes a structure of roles or "named honors" came into being that 
give structure to the rights and duties to the members of a group. Notable 
roles include: 

Speaker with Imperial Voice
Member of Imperial Family
Imperial Vassal

Head Of Family
Mother of the Family (Eldest Female Kin of the Family)
Adult of the Family
Member of the Family

Head Of Line
Mother of the Line (Eldest Female Kin of the Line)
Adult of the Line
Member of the Line

Warleader of the Clan (Daimyo)
Head Of Clan
Mother of the Clan (Eldest Female Kin of the Clan)
Adult of the Clan
Member of the Clan

Vassal of a Clan
Ally of a Clan

Kin by Blood
Kin by Choice

Comrade

Non-Kin

Ronin (non-kin and no assumption of Clan Membership)
Samurai (non-kin but assumed to have some Clan Membership)

Judge

Sensei 
Student

Honored Elder

An individual may have more than one role in a conversation. Someone 
could well be at the Daimyo and the "Head of a Clan" and a "Head of the Line"
and the "Head of a Family". 

There is a basic ordering or precedence (subject to change within context ) that 
is fairly universal. It is numbered here and those roles with the same number 
overlap heavily in terms of precedence.

1.  Emperor

2a  Speaker with Imperial Voice
2b  Judge

3a  Member of Imperial Family
3b  Judge
3c  Shogun

4a. Imperial Vassal
4b. Warleader of the Clan (Daimyo)
4c. Head Of Clan

5.  Mother of the Clan (Eldest Female Kin of the Clan)

6.  Head Of Line
7.  Mother of the Line (Eldest Female Kin of the Line)

8.  Head Of Family
9.  Mother of the Family (Eldest Female Kin of the Family)

10  Adult of the Clan
11  Member of the Clan
12  Adult of the Line
13  Member of the Line
14  Adult of the Family
15  Member of the Family

16  Kin by Blood
17  Kin by Choice
18  Vassal of a Clan
19  Ally of a Clan

20  Comrade

21  Samurai (non-kin but assumed to have some Clan Membership)

22  Ronin (non-kin and no assumption of Clan Membership)

23  Non-Kin

There are a number of roles orthogonal to the rest. They present
interesting studies in etiquette.

Sensei 
Student
Honored Elder
Father 
Mother
Adopted Father
Adopted Mother 

In conversation or other communications there are clues to indicate the role 
that someone is taking on. A word and a gesture may suffice to indicate that a 
person is taken on the role of Head of Line rather than head of Family or the 
role of Daimyo rather than Head of Clan. The signals may work both ways. A 
subordinate may effectively "insist" that the other take on a specific role by 
keeping the conversation on a specific topic or by constantly addressing him 
with the signals that assume that role.

In addition, there may be a rejection of a implied or requested role. A Ronin 
may make an overture that indicates that he considers a Samurai to be a 
comrade and the Samurai may choose to return it (acceptance), ignore it 
(rejected but not excluding the possibility in the future), reassert the 
previous signal (rejected), or take verbal note of the attempt (usually an 
indicator that the Samurai was offended or wishes to offer instruction :-) ).

Each clan of course has its own layer of code but there are some things that 
stand out across all of Dal-Kon.

The Head of Family speaks for the good of the family
The Head of Line speaks for the good of the line.
The Head of Clan speaks for the good of the clan.

The Emperor speaks for the good of Dal-Kon 

Each Head is absolute in their own domain. Head of family must treat with Head 
of Family and Head of Clan only interferes when Clan welfare is affected.

The differences in code between Inner Clans and Outer Clans are centered around 
purpose. The code affecting the Inner Clans is designed to channel the energies 
and maneuvers of the greater clans in the empire into a very competitive game 
where bloodshed only rarely erupts. The code governing the Outer Clans is 
designed to minimize bloodshed while keeping the clans on a practical footing 
based in the realities of war. This extends to differences in clothing, art, 
wedding arrangments, and training. An Inner Clan Bushi is more likely to get 
exposure to strategy and strategic concerns than an Outer Clan Bushi.

In the Inner Clans a veiled insult is likely to result in a 
counterbalancing set of social (and sometimes economic) actions. In an Outer 
Clan a veiled insult will probably lead to a challenge of plain speaking, 
followed by a challenge of martial skill, so that all may see the willingness of 
an Outer Clan member to use the tools of war. It is typical to 
have strenous contests using bokken, hand to hand, or staves. 

One of the traditional elements of code that differs is the right of the Outer 
Clans to call necessity before the Emperor.  When a Dal-Kon says "Necessity 
Exists" he or she is calling attention to their need to act according to their 
duties even if their is an associated cost in terms of loss of face or honor. 
They may also be calling the attention of a superior to a task or situation that 
the superior must handle. Early on in the first emperor's reign it was 
established that the Outer Clans have the right to call necessity before the 
Emperor. No Head of an Outer Clan has ever been silenced or penalized by 
Imperial Word for the act of standing in court and calling necessity. Of the 
five times necessity has been called by Inner Clan heads it has resulted in the 
direct punishment of four of them. The fifth was richly rewarded.
