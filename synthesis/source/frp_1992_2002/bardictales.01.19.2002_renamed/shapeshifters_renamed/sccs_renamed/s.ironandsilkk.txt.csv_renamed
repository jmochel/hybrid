"Re: Menahan Deathknight questions","
-----Original Message-----

Okay.  Death Knights are very high-level undead that have the
intelligence(or greater) of a human being.  They are almost always high
level Paladins of Arken that have become undead.   They have a minimum PCF
of 50 and can get as high as 150.  Their DVF is at least 15.   They tend to
have low Agility, high Aura, very high Strength, and very very high Drives.
Everything else is normal.

As such they are capable of Divine Gifts as a living Paladin that vary from
Paladin to Paladin.  Typical Arken Gifts:

Draw Life
Death Fire
Protection Vs. Life
Regenerate
Command
Shadow Walk

As undead they have Dark Sight as a natural skill, and have no system shock.
They are immune to normal weaponry, and can be harmed by light-and
fire-based metals(gold, silver, platinum, copper), natural
weapons(tree-limbs, wooden spears) and magical- or divinely-enhanced
weapons.   They are as vulnerable to magic as anyone else but have
unbelievably high Magic Defenses and Saves.  They can be turned by the same
rules as any supernatural creature and are effected by sunlight- though they
are more  immune to sunlight than the Lethar....

Some Death Knights have extensive sorcery skills, none are Wizards.  They
all are fighters.

As a rule they disdain missile weapons, though are willing to and are not
stupid about this.   They tend to wear pre-Feudal plate and use Feudal
weapons but of immensely high quality.  Highly magic armor and
almost-artifact class weapons are the rule not the exception.  They tend not
to carry vorpal blades, unless they are Nazgul.

Nazgul are the highest leadership of the Death Knights.

 They tend to be high skilled tacticians and strategists and have high
leadership skills.

They hold a powerful political place in the hierarchy of the Arkenites.","Alexander M. Jackl","ajackl@avs.com","SMTP","Jim Jackl-Mochel","jmochel@foliage.com","SMTP","Alexander M. Jackl","ajackl@avs.com","SMTP",,,,,,"Normal",,"Normal"

         I need to check with the higher ups because I would have to clear

I am sorry. Have I erred ? I was under the impression that
you wanted the maps to reflect popular usage. So, when I
commisioned the reproduction of all 400 maps I did so with the Doraville
name on it. Did you wish it otherwise ?

      I still don't understand what Mordanith has to do with this and the
name KaDora is actually a tribute to the man who made Hemidella possible.
It is a merging of Kay and Dora into one name...hence KaDora... that is why
it is very important that the name remain intact and whole...otherwise the
tribute is mut..... don't you think?

     Also, I am kind of wondering why it wasn't passed by me in the first
place before hundreds of copies were made?  I would have been able to
correct the problem before it became one...

Most humbly and concernedly yours

I would never think it my place to correct a fellow being in power but I
must ask: do you not remember asking myself and diverse others of
my party to aid in the mapping of your land ? We did so and constructed
a few hundred copies for use in and around Marden and Heimdella.
Admittedly they are crude and only show the rough physical and magical
topography in a rough marked grid but I thought that the color and naming
choices where quite good. I kept Erithmaeon's artistic impulses in check.
Is it wise for you to flaunt common usage in this way ? Perhaps my dwarvish
is lacking
in detail but I believe that Doraville more clearly reflects its context.
KaDora (as I understand it)
means ""Of Dora"" , surely a more fitting appelation for your child then your
village. Doraville, as I
understand Mearan means ""Dora's Town"" or ""Dora's Dwelling"" . I think the
second is
closer to the meaning you wish to convey.
Of course, if you wish it to be so it the originals can be modified. But
any
modifications to the (no doubt numerous ) copies made by the Marden
mage guild will have to be megotiated with them.
Yours in shared distress at this loss in clarity and tranquility,

	Hi Guys,


		I realize that the name MKP has deep, loving and
long-standing meaning to you, but as a recent addition it does seem odd to
me that we continue to refer to a player who hasn't played in about three
years in the present tense. Although I am sure that Pelleas is enjoying
deification, well it's just a bug up my butt.
Here are some alternate suggestions and I am *sure* you can come up with
more.

MK et al
The annoying guests
We slay and lay em
couplehood(s)
Flatliners
U see me, then ancestors.
M and K's excellent adventure.
 
and if this adventure goes disasterously wrong
The Dead Ones.

I'm really hoping to hear some clever ones....
