Good morning Alexander,

Just a few quick questions.

I know that if Menahan's grandfather is exposed for treason then the
emperor can impose punishments that include the destruction of
the clan.
If Menahan's grandfather is exposed for killing his own son what would
be the typical punishment?
If Menahan's grandfather is killed, will would be the typical process
involved in naming Menahan the head of the clan? not that
Menahan is actually considering becoming the head of the clan, but
knowing the typical forms that would be observed would be useful.

By the gods, am I ever looking forward to gaming this weekend!

Take care,
Jim

"BT: Dal-Kan History (a really quick query)","Just a brief summary of the Dal-Kan history as I understand it:

1. Remnants of the Golden empire (Elven sub-races, humans, and Golden One partial stranded in the newly formed islands
2. Period of intense fuedal competition and interbreeding (ala Shogunate and clan battles )
3. Revolution corresponding to the ascension of Zencha that established more rational empire with Daimyos looking to the emperor as
the first among peers.
	Start of designation of the emperor as ""Son-Of-Heaven"".

4. Relatively recent (past 400-500 year) ascendancy of the emperor over the daimyos. Daimyos and clans still rule fairly
absolutely on their own lands but imperial agents and factors can operate un-impeded on most of the islands.


Does that match your vision ?

Jim Jakamoto is going to be putting out a series of questions which I
will then answer.  These should be much clearer.

Some of the ideas we are looking at:

(1) You can only have one wizardry- until you are really good (RANK8-10
somehting) and then you can staRT ANOTHER.(Arch mages have ohhh... THREE
Wizardries!)

(2) There are special enhancements and limitations that go along wio\th
being a Wizard of a particular school:

POSSIBLE EXAMPLE:
Dorian Conjuration:
RANK 1: Can do see and identify Conj. magic with normal perception roll
	Can't eat food with Garlic
RANK 3: Have an awareness of Gates and Conj. Tunnels
	Must use Kuo_tu crystals in all spells
RANK 4: Can cast SPELLs in the Conjuring school
RANK 5: Can conjure an object{small size} back/forth in LOS at no cost
        Cannot stand cold iron
RANK 6: Can cast Rituals of the Conj, school.
RANK 7: Can do line-of sight teleport at will, half cost
        Sometimes goes out of phase with current plane.
RANK 8: Can cast Rites of the Conj. school
RANK 9: Can walk any Conjuring pattern at no cost
	Will sometimes walk them by accident
RANK 10: Can cast Invokations of the COnj. school

(3) When one acquires a ""W:"" skill you are tuning yourself to (or
learning at a very fundamental level) the pattern of that Wizardry-
which is the pattern of the relationship between an entity and an
elemental force or willing of some sort.  This is called ""keying"". 

Then there are objects like ""Khalid's Crystal"" - he is keyed to the
object- which is an interface to the actual pattern.  People who study
under a school of Wizardry- as Geoff's Lightning mage studied under the
Thunder Plateau school of Wizardry- would key to their schools papttern
which would be thweir interface to the Evocation pattern.



That is some of our thoughts.

Hm.  E-man has lots more than one, and several more than three.

I don't think of him as an archmage.

It sounds like you are contemplating something more intense than
the already-in-play ""W:"" skills.

Hm.  So you are changing yourself into something other than
baseline human (or elf-- whatever) by advancing along this path.
Interesting, but again it seems like a break with the ""W:"" skills
as previously known.

Hm again.  I was under the impression before that 'keying' (as
practiced by Varune the power-hungry) was a separate activity
that -did- do the restructuring described above.  I was also
under the impression that (for most) it was a one-time thing--
either they had 'keyed' or they hadn't.  If you'll permit a rough
analogy, I had equated it with 'walking the Pattern' in Roger
Zelazny's _Amber_ books.

I had though the Wizardry skills to be more general lore/practice
skills, representing increased familiarity with certain forms of
magic.  I had thought them more like general skills in that
fashion, much as someone might have a ""G:Windows '95"" skill, that
provided a number of bonuses to using programs in that
environment.

Was I wrong, or are you changing things?

If you are changing, it might make more sense to introduce ""Key:""
skills, rather than revising a plethora of skills already out
there.  (And E-man doesn't -want- to wander down half a dozen
paths leading him away from humanity.  He *likes* humans, and
would like to stay one.)

That sounds okay.

Well- here is the problem- I have been playing the ""W:"" s one way with
the PC and some NPCs and another with the NPCs and some PCs.

I am talking about a major change in the way magic is run in
Shapeshifters particularly.  Lara will be surprised by very little in
these discussions since I have been running her this way for a long
time.  

Right Lara?

It is not a change form being human - any more than it is a change form
being human ofr a swordsman to develop callouses and to bluk up their
upper body.  It is a change brought about by the use of the skill but it
is not ""unnatural"".

That is true- and under the ""potential maybe- we are just talking about
it right now"" new paradigm anyone with a W; skill has ""keyed ""
themselves to their school's pattern.

Ummm.. both.  I always though of them as MUCH more than just a ""G:""
skill and I let myself be talked into handling them that way.  We would
be changing the way we run ""W:""s.

Understood- but you may not have all your Wizardries when we are
done.... see potential new rule (1).

"BT MAGIC: Schools of Wizardry/MAGIC","THOSE NOT INTERESTED IN MAGIC SHOULD DELETE.


Chris and I were talking about what skills a Wizard would have.  I
personally have no problem with Wizards having overhead- it adds flavor
to the characters.  It also adds flavor that you wouldn't be able to
learn a new Wizardry until you were at least RANK 8(whereupon it doesn't
count against you and if you get your second Wizardry to an 8 you could
learn a third!)

Three ideas in this post:
<A> G:School
<B>STandard Wizard Package
<C>Elven magics.

(A) G: SCHOOL

People can study a Wizardry without keying to something - they learn ""G:
<school>"". They might be waiting until their RANK in their first
Wizardry goes to 8 before thay can key to another one.   When they
finally key,if ever, they get- immediately upon completing the ritual of
keying- half their RANK in ""G:<school>"" as their ""W:""  ie: If they have
RANK 6.4 in ""G: Running Panda school of illusion"", they would perform
the ritual of keying and then they would have a ""W:Illusion"" of RANK
3.2.  

Characters can choose whether to use ""G: Running Panda"" or ""W:Illusion""
as their General skill (since you only get one per roll.	

In this scenario we have been painting Wizards would always have their
Wizardy ""up"" and running all the time at no cost.  

(B) Here is a possible package example:

The school in this example is the Thunder Plateau(TP for short) School
of Evocation in Doria. (The standard Dorian school of Evocation)

Standard <Evocation/Dorian/Thunder Plateau> Wizard Package

AD: Magery Aptitude II-8; 
AD: Sorcerer1-3(Sorceror2 costs 6);
G: <TP>-2
<TP> lore-2; 
R:<TP RUNE SET> lore-3; 
W:<EVOCATION>-3; 
Library Research-1; 
R/w <TP CAST LANG>-2; 
L: <TP CAST LANG>-3; 
Mental End-2; 
History: Magic-2; 
standard <Evocation> sorcery-2;
standard <Evocation> sorcery2-2;
standard <Evocation> sorcery3-2;
<Evocation> spell of choice-2;
<Evocation> Ritual of Choice-2

Total Cost: 30 ISL

""G: TP"" would act as a filter skill to the W: (i.e. for every 2 RANKS in
""W:"" you would need one rank in ""G: TP""

""W: Evocation"" will also act as filter skill in that for every 2 RANKS
in the spell you are casting you need 1 RANK of ""W:""

""ADVANTAGE: Magery Aptitude II"" allows you to key to a school of
Wizardry.  ""Magery Aptitude I"" allows you to use Sorcery, Thaumaturgy,
Alchemy, and Witchcraft

""ADVANTAGE: Sorceror"" Gives you partial familiarity with all sorceries.
It takes away alien and acultural mods(only -30 compared to -90).  Level
2 of this advantage would make you familiar with all sorceries.


(C) Elven magics.

Elves could not be WIzards.  Period. :-)  
NOTE:  We are about to enter the twilight zone- this is all new- created
out of a conversation between Jim and I.  Lara- note- I think Sea-Elves
might be mor elike Humans but we could talk ...

They instead would learn a skill- Call it Pattern Matching.  Pattern
Matching would be a filter skill in that you would have to have your
RANK in PAttern matching be equal to your rank in a ""W:"" or you would
have to roll under it.

You could have as many ""W:""s as you can train, but you do not get the
sapbs automatically and you do not have it on all the time.  

To bring it ""up"" I.e to use a ability or spell of that school, you would
roll under the ""W:"" or ""Pattern Matching"" Whichever was higher:-) and
then ten-counts latyer(base) you would be linked to the pattern of that
Wizardry, and then able to use a sorcery, ability or spell as a skill. 
HOWEVER- it is an active mental action.. so any casting you do would be
at a florentine. (-40 to cast, -2 SPD).

THeir ""SPELLS"" would be unique to them and different form WIzardirc
spells , rites, and rituals in that they would be more like ""Advanced
SOrceries"" or ""Patterneded SOrceries"".  Much more flexible but not as
robust or strong as Human Wizardry.  

You might call these elves ""Pattern Masters"" or somesuch!  Mordanith
would be a Pattern Master.  Kilsorana is much more like a Wizard. 

Would Fortu be like an elf?  Pook what do you think?  I think so....
they have the same expertise with patterns .... ??????????  That would
also explain why Siggie has so many Wizardries....

Um, I thought wizards -had- overhead.  I am still trying to
buy/study E-man's casting languages and runes up to the point
where he isn't taking minuses.

If you think they need -more- overhead that is, well, fair.  (Not
happy, mind you, just fair.  And is any of this really going to
slow down Falstaff or Tolen?  I thought not.)

Gak.  Not impossible, nor (again) even unfair, but gak.

Hm.  Again, from an Eman-centric point of view, this looks tricky
but doable.  I think, off the top of my head, it would put him at
the 'about to open up a second wizardry' level of magitude.

Wait.  This looks confusing.  (Then again, after 7.5 hours of
Oracle constraints, a Happy Meal looks confusing.)  So the
procedure for a starting wizard would be something like this:

1. Start studying a school of wizardry.  Acquire a G: skill.  Get
several if you want.

2. Perform keying ritual in one school.  G:(that school)
generates a W:(appropriate wizardry) at half the level.  Special
ads/disads ensue. (Based on level of W:?)  Hopefully these will
be live-with-able.  Alex says you will still be human.  Learn
more G: skills if you want.

3. When the W: skill reaches 8, you may attempt another keying
ritual for one of your other G: skills.  Another W: skill, more
ads/disads, still human.  (Possibility of bad interactions for
those who take W:Life/W:Death and other non-amusing
combinations?)

4. A wizard may have any number of W: skills over eight (provided
he earns them), but may only have one under eight at a time.

It that the proposed process?  It sounds suspiciously reasonable,
even if it is a semi-radical change.

So we would have wizardric senses as a result of our attunement
to a particular flavor of magic.  What about the 3%/rank for
activated wizardries?  Would that be a permanent? Or is it going
away, replaced by the 'General skill' comment above?

Well, Eman is -way- underequipped by those standards.  I suspect
most of your practicing PC wizards are.  I hope there's some sort
of grandfather clause, or they'll pull my union card.

OTOH, it is your right to set the standards wherever you wish.
Just be aware that lots of established characters may not meet
them.

Filter skills!! Aaaagh!  (Jim, this is all your fault.)

Okay, I can live with that.

I got something called ""Mage Born"" as an advantage.  I hope that
helps.

In fact, I'm gonna be pretty annoyed if I can't to wizardries any
more.

Okay.  I got that.

Heck, I'm probably responsible for that.  Finally, revenge on
Osumei for that ""Interpersonal Awareness"" thing.  I can live with
this, too.

Dorians (heck, mages in general) probably have a couple simple
tests for these.

Hey!  This is a different mechanic for ""filter skill""!  BAD Alex!

Can you call it a limit skill, or ceiling skill, or overhead
skill, or something else?  (I'd say -anything- else, but I've
seen your nomenclature at work...)

..And now a different mechanic for W: skills!  <outrage goes
here>

You might want a different name for these, too.  Maybe ""Wizardry
Pattern"" skills? (WP:?)

...These sound like specializations of the Pattern skill.
(Pattern 'maneuvers'?)  Is this the only place you are using the
'whichever is higher' mechanic?  Consistency may be the hobgoblin
of little minds, but total chaos has a few detractors as well.

Aside from that, it seems reasonable.

Oooh.  Harsh.  Glad I'm not an elf.  I suspect you'll be hearing

Good.  Better flavor.  More alienness to the elves.

Don't call them 'spells' either.  (Well, maybe humans would call
them Elven spells or something, but they should be songs, or
something.)

I think Fortu, like elves, are 'designed', so it works from that
angle.  They (the Fortu) were designed by human wizards, though,
and some of them were designed to work closely (if sometimes
briefly) with such wizards.  I would suspect them of taking a
third approach, but one closer to human wizards than Elven
whatever-you-call-them.

OK. Warning : Blunt opinions ahead.

Out of my conversations with Alex, Chris and Pook.  I am clear that
Alex thinks that this is all fairly clear and that we are starting somewhere

on the same page. I think we will soon be in the same chapter.

This may be over or understating the case but the ""drunken walk""
nature of the conversation is taking a toll on my thought processes.

To try and condense down what I think Alex is aiming for in some sort
of concrete manner:

[1] Alex wants rules (hard numbers) that enforce a specific world view of
wizards.

[2] Wizards are specialists.

[3] Arch-mages (very rare and powerful birds indeed) are masters of three
wizardries.

[4] There is something significant about the learning of a school of
wizardry that confers
some benefits unto the user.  Somewhere in this is the idea of keying
(becoming conversant with the
power-pattern combination  the wizardry represents) and tuning (taking on
the perceptions/worldview
necessary to casting  the wizardries). The process of learning a wizardry
seems to involve some
kineaesthetic learning or flying by the seat of your pants (or Robes, for a
Dorean). In effect , a skill in how to
interface to the power-pattern of the wizardry.

[5] Sorceries underly the wizardries and their usage is not necessarily
impossible
when doing a wizardry but they may be excluded by the nature of the specific
sorcery/wizardry
combination. (Having the fire wizardy worldview active may prevent the
caster from
casting a water sorcery).

[6] Wizardries such as Pyromancy are collections of magical patterns
that confer some energy/efficiency/time/range/duration gains as a result
of being well worn.

[7] More than one school may exist that use the same wizardry.

[8] Studying two schools of the same wizardry would confer no benefits.

The G:/W: split is artificial and muddy. They are used for the same things
in the same situations with no clear difference other than descrioption.

Given the above attributes and assertions I would suggest the following :

W: Pyromancy
       - Purely kineaesthetic navigation (seat-of-the-robe) flying in a
world-view
       that allows the Pyromantic Pattern to be used.

Lore:  Dicks Discount Dorean Pyromantic school
    - Lore needed to interpret the input from W: Dicks Discount Dorean
Pyromantic school
    at an intellectual level. Necessary to design and modify any casting
within the school.

Spoken Casting Language: Dicks Discount Dorean Pyromantic school
    - Dialect of the standard language used for this type of casting.

Written Casting Language: Dicks Discount Dorean Pyromantic school
    - Read/Write dialect of the standard language used for this type of
casting.
    -needed if you are going to learn spells from written descriptions.

Rune Language: The actual reading/writing skills in the rune language
    - needed for drawing/reading these runes.

Lore: Rune Language: The lore about the properties and functions
    of the runes in the rune language.

W: Pyromancy would act as the only allowable general skill.

A character could learn as much of the lore as necessary but the W:
Pyromancy
would need to be separately learned before the college could be of use. In
fact , you could
view the AD: Magic Aptitude as the ability to learn W:Pyromancy. ""Keying""
would occur at the
point that the W: Pyromancy is learned (even at rank 0.1). Of course,
unfamiliarity mods apply.

W: Pyromancy would act as a filter skill in that the rank of the W:Pyromancy
would
govern the effective, default rank that a Pyromantic spell could be cast at.

A wizard with W: Pyromancy = rank 6, and M: Fireball = rank 8 could cast
Fireball at rank 6
by default or make a separate roll against W: Pyromancy in order to cast the
Fireball at full
effectiveness. This would further reinforce the limitations on wizards in
off the cuff casting situations.

Most of the Elven stuff could be made to wok.

I am not actually committed to overhead- I am committed to designing

It is different than Shapeshifter's has been running... but most of the
NPCs and Verun and Kilsorana have basically been running under this
""concept"" already...  I am sure we can make it work...

Remember- although you can only use one General skill you can have many
that apply- just like secondaries.  The G:school skill is the General
skill for people studying the course of study at the Running Panda
school.  It can be a secondary if not used as a general.  It is fuzzy in
the sense that we use W:s as generals but I want W:s to represent your
relationship to the pattern.

> Also - here is the big question - can you cast a spell with only G:Panda.

NO.  You can only cast them with W:s!  The point of G:s is what if you
want to study the school and don't want to key yourself.  W: is a
magical phenomenon.  You could have as many G:s as you wanted!  Do we
need it?  No.  DOes it add a flavor to have your specific school skill? 
Yes.  I think so!

Yes- you could use G: PIGPEN as a general on Sorceries.  You will also
want Pigpen school lore!!!

(2) Add more alieness to the elves.

JIm is not in any way to be held responsible though for my

The penalty does diminish over time... does anyone else think we should
use the above formula.  It makes a certain sense.  *shrug*

WHat you wouldn't get is:
(1) Having the Wizardry on all the time.
(2) Having no cost to maintaining the WIzardry in MEN
(3) The special abilities of that school of WIzardry (except as seperate
actions/skills

The mistake is the use of the singular.  A better question would be what

it involves Thaumaturgy and Disciplines...!

It depends - this will start tto answer your upcoming question as well- 
Alterationists have a heal that is based on morphing flesh, bone, and
other tissue into its original form and shape.
Life mages pour life into the ""mold"" of your pattern and accelerate your
body's healing process.  
Willworkers have it happen that you don't get any infections and you r
body happens to do everything efficiently  thus healing you far more
quickly than normal.  Some people just use Sorcery : Life. 
A Shaper might restore your pattern- and thus return you to your
""normal"" shape.

All of them have different speeds, pros and cons.

It could be either.  Fundamentally all the patterns contain elements of
the other patterns.  You could only do primitive eIllusions if you
didn't have an illusionst working with you or an illusionist didn't help
design the spell...

Well- I am not sure about pages and chapters.  I also have no thought

Yes- though they would ultimately be inside the same pattern.

That is not clear.  Their are macros, spells, secret knowledge that
would only be available from one particular school.  For instance if you
are a Mage of the Thunder Plateau school of Wizardry you would have
access to Thunder Plateau as a powersource in emergencies...  you would
also be at pluses to call lightning. 
It would change form school to school but each would be better at
different things.

Ahhh.. see above!  If you were G: Running Panda and you wanted the
special abilities of the G: Thunder Plateau school and you had a Rank 12
in Evocation, you would have to use your new 0.3 in GH:Thunder Plateau
as a filter skill for your Evocation.  Your effective Evocation would
0.6 until you raised your G: Thunder Plateau.  You could only use your
effective W: for casting Thunder Platea spells.  You could always cast
your RUnning Panda spells using your full Evocation but it would help
you learn Thunder Plateau at all. 

FOr people who think ""Gosh that is complicated!""  I agree!  I don't
recommend studying two schools of the same Wixardry.  99.9999999999% of
Wizards stay in one School.

Agreed.  Except for the part about W: being the only allowable general

use.

"RE: BT MAGIC: Schools of Wizardry/MAGIC","Great timing, Alex! You caught me just as I finished a project
and before I started the next!  Now it's Comment City time.  I'm
also concatenating the various Pook-response posts into this one.
I don't have any questions on the Jackl-Mochel response, so I'm
leaving it out.


[Myth]
Um, I thought wizards -had- overhead.  I am still trying to
buy/study E-man's casting languages and runes up to the point
where he isn't taking minuses.

If you think they need -more- overhead that is, well, fair.  (Not
happy, mind you, just fair.  And is any of this really going to
slow down Falstaff or Tolen?  I thought not.)

[Alex]
I am not actually committed to overhead- I am committed to
designing rules that create a flavor to magic- that enhance my
ability and our ability to make the story interesting...

[Myth again]
Cool.  I actually got the impression you were doing this as a
flavor thing-- to change the feel of the stories you tell with
the system into something closer to, say, Tolkien or Goodkind
than to Gygax.

Much as I dislike change, this is an area I can't argue with.  If
you feel that wizards have seemed far too commonplace, and not
nearly strange and terrible enough, and that this must be
corrected, I am unable to argue with you.  (Not necessarily
because you're right-- it's just that I am not about to dictate
your personal opinions to you, and that the BT world should be
what you want it to be.)

Now as to the -mechanics- of the change, there I am prepared to
argue, when I see fit.  So don't get cocky, kid.


[Myth]
Wait.  This looks confusing.  (Then again, after 7.5 hours of
Oracle constraints, a Happy Meal looks confusing.)  So the
procedure for a starting wizard would be something like this:

1. Start studying a school of wizardry.  Acquire a G: skill.  Get
several if you want.

2. Perform keying ritual in one school.  G:(that school)
generates a W:(appropriate wizardry) at half the level.  Special
ads/disads ensue. (Based on level of W:?)  Hopefully these will
be live-with-able.  Alex says you will still be human.  Learn
more G: skills if you want.

3. When the W: skill reaches 8, you may attempt another keying
ritual for one of your other G: skills.  Another W: skill, more
ads/disads, still human.  (Possibility of bad interactions for
those who take W:Life/W:Death and other non-amusing
combinations?)

4. A wizard may have any number of W: skills over eight (provided
he earns them), but may only have one under eight at a time.

[Alex]
All correct.... (i.e. it matches my thinking!:-) )  I think it
will be cool!

[Myth again]
Rats!  Again, nothing to object to.  Assuming the transition is
handled with dignity and grace for us old-timers, that is.


[Pook]
I am leery about things which automatically give you another
skill just based on the fact that people who learn G:Panda
Followed by W:Panda get a free skill whereas the other way does
not (or does it).  On the other hand, is G:Panda any use once you
have W:Panda.  It just seems weird.

[Alex]
Remember- although you can only use one General skill you can
have many that apply- just like secondaries.  The G:school skill
is the General skill for people studying the course of study at
the Running Panda school.  It can be a secondary if not used as a
general.  It is fuzzy in the sense that we use W:s as generals
but I want W:s to represent your relationship to the pattern.

[Myth]
I think Pook has a point here.  By completing a 'free' (in ISP's)
ritual, you gain a variable level skill at no cost.  If I start
play just after the keying ritual, I pay points for my W: skill.
If I start play just before, I get a free one for my next run.
(Ignoring GM screw-with-the-smug-powergaming-player options.)

Keying should be an advantage.  It should allow the learning of
otherwise-unlearnable W: spells, not give them away. You might
even want it to come in several levels, for learning higher ranks
of the W: skill.  Or it might vary by school.  Or schools might
want you to check-in for a keying ritual from time to time, even
though there is no real metaphysical reason for it.

(""Real metaphysical""?? Sheesh!)


[Pook]
Also - here is the big question - can you cast a spell with only
G:Panda.
If so what's the use of W: skills.  If not whets the point of G:
wizardries.

[Alex]
NO.  You can only cast them with W:s!

[Myth]
Okay.  So the keying ritual ties you into some reality-defying
pattern that allows you to perform 'magical' feats.  The strength
of your link with this force is expressed in the rank of your W:
skill.

A G: skill in the school is a technical knowledge of the field,
but only represents lore, not power.

I think some of the strength of your argument is lost to your use
of old terms with which we think we are familiar.  Please let me
know if I have interpreted them incorrectly here.


[Alex]
Characters can choose whether to use ""G: Running Panda"" or
""W:Illusion"" as their General skill (since you only get one per
roll.

[Myth]
Is the other one allowed as a secondary or tertiary?

[Alex again]
Absolutely!

[Myth again]
Okay.  We have a W: skill.  It is always up, and adds a permanent
3%/rank.  In this case, I would -strongly- recommend against
being able to use it as a General skill as well.  Let us use the
G: skill as a General (that's what it's there for) and let the W:
skills add their support outside the secondary/tertiary
structure.  Letting them add 3%/rank -plus- General skill mods
makes them to powerful.  Letting them add 3%/rank -or- General
skill mods is, well, silly.


[Alex]
They instead would learn a skill- Call it Pattern Matching.
Pattern Matching would be a filter skill in that you would have
to have your RANK in Pattern matching be equal to your rank in a
""W:"" or you would have to roll under it.

[Myth]
Hey!  This is a different mechanic for ""filter skill""!

[Alex again]
Yea- I know- I hadn't thought it through all the way!

[Myth again]
On top of the consistency issue, this 'roll higher of two' thing
makes me nervous.  Though, come to think of it, it's the same
thing we do with Magic Aptitude already.  Can I assume you will
handle things on the same ""better off with the more specific
skill"" fuzzy way you handle MAP vs. sorceries now?

[Pook]
Danger.  No impact rule for high level mages.  You should have to
roll under something like:

     Pattern Matching Skill - (70 - 10*Wizardry Skill)

[Myth again]
Okay.  I missed the joke.  What formula are you mimicking?  (And
do you see why I try to deal with this on a conceptual level,
rather than a mathematical one?)

[Alex again]
The penalty does diminish over time... does anyone else think we
should use the above formula.  It makes a certain sense.  *shrug*

Somebody comment...

[Myth again]
No comments on specific mechanics of Elven Pattern Magic at this
time.  I'll wait until the forms are a little better defined.
(Though with elves, that may take a while...)


[Alex]
You could have as many ""W:""s as you can train, but you do not get
the spabs automatically and you do not have it on all the time.

[Myth]
You might want a different name for these, too.  Maybe ""Wizardry
Pattern"" skills? (WP:?)

[Alex again]
They would be ""G:"" skills not ""W:""s - excuse me for being sloppy!
I should probably even have a new acronym for them: ""EPM:""s Elven
Pattern Matrix!:-)

[Myth]
Go ahead.  Threaten me with more acronyms!  I defy you and your
TLA's!

The point here is that elves develop skills in a subset of the
Master Pattern that are more useful for certain areas of magic,
mimicking (to an extent) the human wizardries.  Elves being smart
enough not to make permanent alteration in their personal
patterns, these remain conscious, willed acts, and require mental
endurance to maintain.


[Pook]
But I am not sure whether I buy into the Patterner thing yet.  I
am waffling.  Might I point out that unless the ""more flexible
but not as robust"" clause becomes clearer that for JimJM and I,
being a Patterner would basically mean business as usual with a
small minus which would go away after a few runs.

[Alex]
What you wouldn't get is:
(1) Having the Wizardry on all the time.
(2) Having no cost to maintaining the Wizardry in MEN
(3) The special abilities of that school of Wizardry (except as
separate actions/skills)

[Myth]
I would still favor a clearer mechanical definition.  Half effect
on the more general skill, or something like that.  (Adjust
specifics to flavor.)

Pookie is right that the Florentine penalties would be the main
disad, and could be easily dealt with at the success levels they
are talking.  The other points would be basically just advantages
that other people are getting and they are not, and could easily
be handled tactically, especially since they situations they are
used to dealing with mimic the proposed new situation quite
closely.


== Part 2 ==

[Pook]
What kind of Wizard built the net.  It is highly abjurational,
has transport lines (conj) and communication lines (div) as well
as other things we don't know about.  It is obviously has some
discipline in it but is it's base rooted in a wizardry? Is it
multi-disciplinary?

[Alex]
The mistake is the use of the singular.  A better question would
be what kinds of Wizards built the net.  Also the net's
technology isn't just Wizardric- it involves Thaumaturgy and
Disciplines...!

[Myth]
Okay.  What kind of -Wizards- built the net?

Obviously, very powerful ones.  Big deal.

I know (roughly) what Disciplines are.  Do we have a working
definition of Thaumaturgy?  What sort of people use it?


[Pook]
What school would the spell heal to pattern belong to (which
everyone in Shifters has to my knowledge except maybe Kilsorana)?

[Alex]
It depends - this will start to answer your upcoming question as
well- Alterationists have a heal that is based on morphing flesh,
bone, and other tissue into its original form and shape.
Life mages pour life into the ""mold"" of your pattern and
accelerate your body's healing process.  Willworkers have it
happen that you don't get any infections and your body happens to
do everything efficiently  thus healing you far more quickly than
normal.  Some people just use Sorcery : Life.  A Shaper might
restore your pattern- and thus return you to your ""normal"" shape.

All of them have different speeds, pros and cons.

[Myth]
Very nice, Alex, but not what he asked.

We each have a specific spell (frowned on by knowledgeable
Healers) that performs a ""restore to Pattern"".  It is the same
spell in each case, researched and learned as a group.  Some of
us will be Wizards of different stripes, others will be various
flavors of Pattern-mages.  Is there any way the upcoming system
change can handle this situation?


[Pook]
Can a warder (abjurationist) make matter shields?

[Alex]
Yes- because they can do the Sorcery.  It would be much more
powerful to have an evoker set it up though....

[Pook]
Can you cast a spell from a school if you do not have the W:
skill? I assume not.

[Alex]
No.

[Myth]
Okay.  So a Wizard can only perform -spells- that are part of the
pattern(s) he's keyed to.  He may, however do any -sorceries- he
knows, whether or not they are taught by his school(s).

And, presumably, a non-Wizard can't do any Wizardric spells at
all, though they might have other forms of magic.


[Pook]
I have a magic item which contains keys to 13 wizardries.  Why
did they make it if you are never going to find a mage who is

Good question- why would they do that?:-) :-)  Nice try, Pook!

[Myth]
Um, because they were expecting a group of wizards to use it?

"RE: BT MAGIC: Schools of Wizardry/MAGIC","Read over the post.  In somewhat of the order the questions and thoughts 
appeared here are some reactions:

(1)  Aim for hard rules.  These can always be bent or softened if it leads 
to better flavor.

(4)  How does the ""flying by the seat of robes"" differ from doing 
sorceries?

(8)  Does the filter work as a multiplier?  I think this is a very useful 
system tool that has other applications.  Weapon familiarity comes to mind: 
 if you have a rank 4 in long sword, all swords are pretty much the same 
picking up a new sword would have a filter of (just making up #'s) 75%. 
 This would give you an effective rank 3 or a 10% loss.   If on the other 
hand you have mastered the long sword, say rank 8, each variation would be 
sinificant and that same 75% filter would drop your strike chance by 20%.

(8)  Why is Lore neccessary to design and modify casting within a school? 
 How does the GM enforce this?  At what stage is the Lore roll made?  I 
think modifying spells is more of a SCF skill than an INT skill.  Lore to 
me sounds more like knowing the names of famous school wizards and what 
their specialties were.  Or knowing that your school of wizardry used to 
have a library somewhere in the Bengali hills.

As you can see I couldn't make heads or tails out of it but it did concern 
me that Alex and Jim were so close to agreeing.  ; )

Well- I am not sure about pages and chapters.  I also have no thought
that this is particularly clear.  This is not a well-formulated decision
that I am letting you know about.  It is an inquiry and hence it
wanders.

Yes- though they would ultimately be inside the same pattern.

That is not clear.  Their are macros, spells, secret knowledge that
would only be available from one particular school.  For instance if you
are a Mage of the Thunder Plateau school of Wizardry you would have
access to Thunder Plateau as a powersource in emergencies...  you would
also be at pluses to call lightning.
It would change form school to school but each would be better at
different things.

Ahhh.. see above!  If you were G: Running Panda and you wanted the
special abilities of the G: Thunder Plateau school and you had a Rank 12
in Evocation, you would have to use your new 0.3 in GH:Thunder Plateau
as a filter skill for your Evocation.  Your effective Evocation would
0.6 until you raised your G: Thunder Plateau.  You could only use your
effective W: for casting Thunder Platea spells.  You could always cast
your RUnning Panda spells using your full Evocation but it would help
you learn Thunder Plateau at all.

FOr people who think ""Gosh that is complicated!""  I agree!  I don't
recommend studying two schools of the same Wixardry.  99.9999999999% of
Wizards stay in one School.

Agreed.  Except for the part about W: being the only allowable general

use.

"BT:  Release 6.4 now up on Web site!!!!","I have finally gotten Release 6.4 of Bardic Tales up on the Web site.

www.midnight.com/~ajackl/bt/

It is mostly cleanups of errors, typos and stupidities in the 6.0
Release that we all caught.  

New Changes: 
Success Levels
SPD simplification
some secondary formulas are made simpler or simply accurate
some new sorceries on the sorcery sheet
new movement rules

I am just putting in the support skill details into the support skill
index so you may not get that until tomorrow

The major changes are in btgen (the first chapter) and the magical
appendix.  There are signicant changes in the system rules sections.

I have not done anything that hasn't been hashed over by the BT Design
list.  Oops- except for the added sorceries.... *grin*

Have fun!

Yikes!  Hold that thought... not yet.... in short it is manipulation of

That description by Jim is probably unfortunate.  Sorcery IS flying by
the seat of your pants, Wizardry is mor elike instrument flying.  You
suddenly have a panel in fornt of you that allows you to see things you
couldn't see and do things you wouldn't be able to do without it! It is
fundamentaly NOT flying by the seat of your pants but rather the
opposite.

Ummm .. no?  I haven't decided on a strong mechanism for filter skills
yet.

Becaus eit is not just a listing of the saint's names in the school- it
is like having the knowledge of Newton's Laws in structural
engineering.  You don't use it in construction but you have to account
for it in the design of the building.

"RE: BT MAGIC: Schools of Wizardry/MAGIC","Preemptive posting!

Early-morning Myth is.... beaten by early-morning Jackl-Mochel.
Sigh.

Maybe tomorrow.


[Myth]
Okay.  We have a W: skill.  It is always up, and adds a permanent
3%/rank.  In this case, I would -strongly- recommend against
being able to use it as a General skill as well.  Let us use the
G: skill as a General (that's what it's there for) and let the W:
skills add their support outside the secondary/tertiary
structure.  Letting them add 3%/rank -plus- General skill mods
makes them too powerful.  Letting them add 3%/rank -or- General
skill mods is, well, silly.

[Alex]
No- it is the general!  But if they have another general that
applies that is higher they have the right to use that one
instead.

[Myth again]
Thanks.  That was not clear before.

So Wizardries do -not- add 3%/rank simply by existing.  Instead,
they may be used as General Skills, giving the 3%/rank bonus
normal to that position.

Okay.


[Alex]
Shape change works like this->
 (ShapeChange RANK * 10) - (70 - 10*RANKinShapeDesired)

[Myth]
Ah.  I do not remember that from my Dullo days.  Thanks for
explaining.

[Myth]
I know (roughly) what Disciplines are.  Do we have a working
definition of Thaumaturgy?  What sort of people use it?

[Alex]
Yikes!  Hold that thought... not yet.... in short it is
manipulation of the fundamental forces of energy that make up
things.  You can drain energy out of objects and move energy
around and attach energy to things.

[Myth again]
Okay.  Morphus' ""pegging"" is an aspect of this.  And very
dangerous people use it. I'm cool with that.

broken links and incorrect file calls.

A couple of things that people might want to notice:

(1) The discussion of protection values in the Armor section of the
Combat chapter.

(2) The new sorceries in the Sorcery sheet of the Magic Appendix

(3) Slight nomenclature change ""Invokation"" has been replaced by
""Incantation""

(4) The support skill appendix...

(5) Success Levels everywhere...

"BT MAGIC: Wizardry ","Ahem.

Another idea- brace yourselves against immediate reaction! 

There are 8 ""macro-Wizardries"",that is to say Wizardries which have
Wizardries underneath them:

Abjuration, Alteration, Conjuration, Divination, Enchantment,
Elemental,  Evocation, and Summoning 

Now... what if those were really not ""W:""s = at least not ones that
humans had access to?  

What if all Wizardries were created equal and there were only the basic
patterns and not the one one level up.  In other words..
There would no longer be a skill called W: Abjuration, there would only
be W: Shaping, W: Binding, W:Warding. 

This is how the Elemental ones have been running for a while- I think it
would be a good thing if all of them ran like that.  

""But Alex,"" you say, ""I am have RANK 10 in Abjuration and only RANK 4 in
the sub-schools!""

I say, ""DOn't worry!""(at which point you wince!:-)) I would have you get
the Initial SKill Level Value of the macro-pattern and distribute it
amongst the lesser patterns!  This is a good thing for you!  Your SCF is
likely to go up! 

""But Alex,"" you say, ""I bacame a specialist because of the 6% per rank

I say ""Don't worry! I am going to let you increase your skill to osme

What do you think?  But there's mORE!!!!  Tell them what they have WON! 

ADVANTAGES:

No special rules!  
More variety and spice to Wizards! 

NOW: PART 2! The special RULES!  :-):-):-)

The macro-patterns existence - though not ""w:""s or skills- do give one
BIG advantage: they allow for advancment in the sister ""w:""s before you
reach RANK 8 in any one.  In other words you would be able to have RANK
5 in Binding, RANK 3 in Shaping , and RANK 2 in WARDING because they are

"Re: Sunday - Please Read","A cool thing to come up with might be list of what the special abilities
of your highest Wizardry(s) is(are).   Just pop off some ideas...

A standard format:
RANK 1 - see and identify brand of magic with normal perception
RANK 2 - can cast Workings (a change from below)
RANK 3 - do the sorceries of the school at half-cost
RANK 4 - Cast Rituals of the brand of magic
RANK 5 - Do some particular sorcery of the school at no base-cost.
RANK 6 - cast Rites of the brand of magic
RANK 7 - Do the workings of the school at half-cost, do all sorceries 
	at no base-cost
RANK 8 - cast Incantations of that brand of magic

THis is boring and cookie cutter though you can us eit as a template.

We need top come up with cool disads too! 

Remember- flavor, color and effect are the name of the game! 

The play is the thing....

Poor example I whipped out earlier:  (for breakpoints use standard
format above...)

I disagree.  I think there is alot a Warder could do.  

I think whenever you had a Warding school (a specific set of special

Hmmm.... I see what you are saying but still disagree.

Power Attack is definitley a Shaping.
Detect and Identify Power belong to all three schools.

Subject:	BT MAGIC: Wizardry

Ahem.

Another idea- brace yourselves against immediate reaction!

There are 8 ""macro-Wizardries"",that is to say Wizardries which have
Wizardries underneath them:

Abjuration, Alteration, Conjuration, Divination, Enchantment,
Elemental,  Evocation, and Summoning

Now... what if those were really not ""W:""s = at least not ones that
humans had access to?

What if all Wizardries were created equal and there were only the basic
patterns and not the one one level up.  In other words..
There would no longer be a skill called W: Abjuration, there would only
be W: Shaping, W: Binding, W:Warding.

This is how the Elemental ones have been running for a while- I think it
would be a good thing if all of them ran like that.

""But Alex,"" you say, ""I am have RANK 10 in Abjuration and only RANK 4 in
the sub-schools!""

I say, ""DOn't worry!""(at which point you wince!:-)) I would have you get
the Initial SKill Level Value of the macro-pattern and distribute it
amongst the lesser patterns!  This is a good thing for you!  Your SCF is
likely to go up!

""But Alex,"" you say, ""I bacame a specialist because of the 6% per rank
for the sub-schools!""

I say ""Don't worry! I am going to let you increase your skill to osme
fair number such that you don't get screwed!""

""But ALex,"" you say, ""I am an elf and have a RANK 14 in ABJURATION!""

""DOn't worry!"" I say, ""Elves have invented an Abjuration- we will talk
and you will, I think, be happiest of all of my Faeries!""

What do you think?  But there's mORE!!!!  Tell them what they have WON!

ADVANTAGES:

All wizardries handled the same
No special rules!
More variety and spice to Wizards!

NOW: PART 2! The special RULES!  :-):-):-)

The macro-patterns existence - though not ""w:""s or skills- do give one
BIG advantage: they allow for advancment in the sister ""w:""s before you
reach RANK 8 in any one.  In other words you would be able to have RANK
5 in Binding, RANK 3 in Shaping , and RANK 2 in WARDING because they are
related.


I like this flavor alot!  Comments?

"RE: Ward of Nuryev and the Heartstone Isolation","Well, the easy answer is ""Welcome to the club,"" but that's
E-man's bitterness speaking, not mine, and it isn't particularly
helpful.

1. It is likely that there was an in-game conspiracy to
manipulate Morphus, all suggestive comments aside.

2. It is likely that the other player-characters participated for
their own reasons, some of which they may not have chosen to
share.

3. It is not likely that player-characters conspired to
manipulate Morphus into helping remove the Heartstone so that the
gods could pull the Valhalla thing.

4. It is likely that Alex (not the gods) is taking advantage of
the situation-as-it-exists and (in a Type III reality shift)
having had the gods plan that all along.  One of the better ways
to play all-knowing (or even lots-and-lots-knowing) beings is to
define a lot of their plans retroactively, letting them 'predict'
or 'manipulate' characters when the players are inherently
unpredictable.  I suspect that is what is happening here.

5. I suspect trying to develop a full analytical understanding of
the Machine/Heartstone/Prime relationship is a waste of time.
Learn what you can, get a feel for it, and take your best guess.
I realize that the lack of hard answers is annoying to you as a
player, but many of Alex's philosophical constructs are left
deliberately fuzzy, for several reasons.  First, trying to
develop a finely detailed metaphysics for a world at least as
complex as our own will take infinite time.  Second, I suspect he
doesn't want to leave himself with a strictly mechanistic
universe, but would rather leave some 'wiggle' room so the needs
of the plot can be met.

6. As to the Rismaeon/Symbol/Power thing, I don't think we
anticipated/asked about major Reality shifts like the Valhalla
business.  Given that, Alex is free to implement any result that
will keep the story alive/interesting.

7. Gods use people.  That is one of their functions.  Either
because they are manipulative bastards by nature, or because they
are so used to maneuvering around each other that they know no
other way to behave, or because they see a Higher Vision and feel
that the sacrifice is worth it.  Either way, it's nothing
personal.  Just keep in mind that it is the gods manipulating
Morphus, not Alex manipulating Chris.


Well, that's my take on things.  Hope it helps.

"Ward of Nuryev and the Heartstone Isolation","I'm only sending this message to you three because I'm pretty sure that
Lara/Kilsorana and Britt/Khalid wouldn't care or understand.  I wasn't sure
about Myth/E-man, but decided to include you just in case.

At the moment I have no character proof for what I think is the case.  It
is possible that one or more of you have information that you did not
reveal for character reasons.  Since the original suggestion to
isolate/destroy the Heartstone came to us through Sigmund, Pookie/Sigmund
is the one most likely to have that information.  Whether that is the case
or not, Chris doesn't hold it against you.  We all asked a lot of questions
and did a lot of research, and then made our individual decisions to
participate.

I definitely felt that I didn't have a full understanding of how the
Machine related to the Symbol, how the Symbol related to the Prime, how the
Machine and the Symbol related to reality changes in the Prime, etc.  I did
think that I had asked Alex the same question enough different ways to be
sure that I understood things enough to make an educated decision.

Recent events, however, have caused me to have some serious doubts, however.

It looks like we (Morphus at least) have been seriously manipulated.  I
made some assumptions about the cause of the breakdown of the machine which
I now believe were either 100% wrong or partially incomplete.  There
appears to have been a significant Divine influence in the breakdown of the
machine with the direct intention being to then arrange for the isolation
of the Heartstone.  I never considered that the same entities that took out
the machine would be the ones that would back the isolation.  And that they
wanted that to occur so that they could initiate a major reality change.
Something really big just happened while we were in Valhalla, and I have no
idea just how widespread the effects are.

Another mistake on my part was that although I knew:
That the effect of the isolation would be to allow non-isolated Context
Symbols to expand with significantly less resistance; 
That it would be much more difficult for reality shifts that affected the
Prime to occur;
That a new Symbol representing the Prime would, over time, be regenerated; 

I did not realize that the time scale for that regeneration was non-linear
and that it would be drastically accelerated by any Context wide reality
shifts which occurred.  Ie, As soon as Rismaeon has the machine repaired he
has access to power, though it won't be at the same level as before unless
either time passes, additional reality shifts occur, or we bring back the
other symbol.

"BT: Prefix shorthand for Skills ","In all the conversations that have been going on, I've found myself picking
up on something that has rubbed me the wrong way for a while.  The prefixes
that we currently use to categorize skills on the character sheets aren't
always clear and I'd like to make a proposal to correct that.

These are the current prefixes that we use to categorize skills on the
character sheets.  In cases where we have changed the term that we use to
refer to something, I've written new-term (old-term):

G:      General Skills

R:      Rune systems
L:       Spoken Language (casting language or conversational language)
R/W:  Read/Write language (casting language or conversational language)

Lore:  Any lore skill

          Thaumaturgies  -  No official one that I know of.
          Alchemical Processes           
                                 -  No official one that I know of.  

          Natural Magics  -  No official one that I know of.  
          Craft Magics     -  No official one that I know of.

S:      Sorceries
M:      Wizardries 
             - Workings(Spells), Rituals, Rites and Incantations(Invokations)
W:     Wizardry Patterns(Schools)           
             - The skill represents your attunement to a Wizardry Pattern
          Disciplines        -  No official one that I know of.

         Divine skills       (under DVF)  -  No official one that I know of.
D:      Divine Links      (under DVF)
            - The skill represents the intensity of your relationship 
              with a Will Pattern.
G:      Divine Gifts       (under DVF)
P:      Priestly Rituals (under INF.  Basic ceremonies: weddings,

I:        Incarnate Magics
          Creation Magics  -  No official one that I know of.


This is what I would suggest using:

G:      General Skills
          For Example: 
          G: Thunder Plateau school of Electromancy.
            - General skill representing your knowledge of, 
              and attunement to, a specific Wizardry School

L:       Spoken Language (casting language or conversational language)
R/W:  Read/Write language (casting language or conversational language)

Lore:  Any lore skill

T:       Thaumaturgies
A:       Alchemical Processes

          Natural Magics   -- Alex?
          Craft Magics       -- Alex?

S:      Sorceries
W:     Wizardries  - Workings, Rituals, Rites and Incantations

WP:   Wizardry Patterns  
        -> The skill represents attunement to a Wizardry Pattern

DI:      Discipline One spells
DII:     Discipline Two spells

D:      Divine prayers           (under DVF)
         (These are not spells or skills, but rather 
           requests/prayers/supplications/invocations)
         Prime examples being Summon Divine Aid, Bless, 
            Absorb Faith, and Heal.
DP:    Divine Patterns         (under DVF)
            - The skill representing the intensity of your relationship 
              with a Will Pattern.

Subject:	BT Magic: Some elaboration.

Okay- let me explain something:

First- what Myth said.

My system does not have a SLIGHT bias that OLD might be better than
NEW.  Old IS better than NEW and a LOT better.  I mean a LOT better.

There are a couple of things which the world is dependant on:

(a) everyone moves through time at relatively the same pace and in the
same direction.

(b) context generating beings are ABSURDLY difficult to create

(c) the world as the characters know it- the ""Prime""- has a huge
""reality mass"" and ""reality momentum"" that is based on the millions and
millions of context generating beings who live in that point of view and
the fundamentals of it (elemental structure, some of the rules of magic,
DVF behaviour) are created out of the basic forces that created the
world.  These are- for practical purposes- unmalleable on any kind of
large scale.  At best you could create temporary pockets were those
things were not in place.

(d) all the other places in the ""universe"" (the Abyss, Hell, Faerie, the
Outer Planes, the Bridge) are merely mirrors and shadows of the prime.
They have almost no reality mass compared to the prime.   This is why
the Prime- and its inhabitants are so critical and why everyone is
fighting over it.  It is also why it was such a big deal at the end of
the Second Chaos War when the BiFrost was set to ward it and lock in the
""rules of engagement"" for the Gods.

(e) Most of the currently known Wizardries are based on Mardr'a
teachings in the 5 th century after the Second Chaos War.  Legend has it
that a mysterious teacher from before the Ward taught her the Rune Sets
and the basic WIzardries which became the Dorian standards.

There are some exceptions coming from the Naakor, from Rhelania and from
Tharuden.

(f) The Law of Patterns and the Law of Symbols causes patterns using
magic to grow in power as they are used more and more znd as cultures
interface with those they start to drift towards whatever the consensus
is.  I.e. a mage in Ven trying to learn Illusion will ""accidently""
develop runes and speakings very similar to Ancient Rhelanian and its
rune set. The extant to which it is not related to that is the extant to
which it is ineffective.  This is importnat to get- THERE ARE NO RIGHT
WAYS TO DO WIZARDRY!  the right ones are the one that have been done the
most and whose patterns have the most reality mass behind them.  AS it
grows in power a language might have to be abandoned as a normal
langauge because it is too powerful- the patterns of its speaking can
cause unpredictable results! :-)

Given that a new, clever language or a new WIzardry is going to be
barely a hyped up sorcery at best!! AT BEST!  The DOrian Wizardries are
EVERYWHERE because they were institutionalized very effectively by
Mardra and sooon everyone began using them and they became the most
popular and therefore the way it is done.

Older and more used is always better than younger and less used.  This
is not technologhy where the physical prinicples and lawes are out ther
eand we need to design something that uses them better... unless you
discover a ""purwer"" version of a spell that is more effective at tapping
into the pattern than the opne that everyone now uses because of a typo
that happeend in the 10th century in the copy being made of Bob the
Arch-Mages spell book.

*PHEW* does that all make sense? :_)

Ancient Dorian.

No- The modern Wizardires are cast in Ancient Dorian because that is the
language that Mardra spoke!

The modern Wizardires were not a result of gradual improvement - most of them-
thirteen to be exact- came into being within the same century.  And Madra
invented them all!!!!!!

Nobody knew(or still knows for that matter ) what a Kuo-Toa or a Slaad was-
except maybe for Mardra and her teacher- and neither of them have talked for
1200 years! :-)

"BT MAGIC: Forwarded from Jack"," Jack writes:

  The magic language system makes sense.  Old is better, or new is
better
doesn't have much to do with it.  Just because a language evolves, it
doesn't
necessarily mean that it would make magic more powerful, or more
efficient.
For example, how many ways could physicists describe a brick in free
fall
today, compared with the description of Isaac Newtons time?  I think
physicist
today could spend hours describing the motion of the brick, perhaps
using many
terms, concepts, not available to Newton, but in the end, its just a
falling
brick, and Newton probably described it efficiently.
        On the other hand, as languages evolve they often loose their
ability to
efficiently describe things that the older culture emphasized.  For
example,
in ""old"" Ugandan their is a single word to describe a particularly large
male
antelope who has been cut off from the herd.  In modern Ugandan there
exists
no such word.
        In Bardic Tales the language of magic apparently is somewhere in
between
these two realistic evolutions, therefore, Alex is on the right
tract...(once
again)

"Re: Current Date","2100 is this ERA not this Cycle.....

The date into this Cycle is the 25,XXX If you look at the time line....

In a linear chronologiocal paradigm:
Era's are typically 10,000ish years, EPOCHS 100,000ish years, and then
their are millenia(1000), centuries(100), decades(10) and years.

This is a complete BS abstraction but useful for conversational
historical speaking purposes.

2100 is also a change- I think I earlier in the gaming world set the
second Chaos War At 1800 years ago not 2100.

What do you guys think?

The Heartstone ritual was just weeks ago!    I was completely off!

One general comment.  As of late when you reply to e-mails I have
noticed that your text appears in the quoted comment section as such
 
>My Text properly indented
>Your text also indented so as to be indistinguashable from my text
> More of my text 
 
instead of 
 
>My Text properly indented
Your text more clearly demarcated
> More of my text 
 
as is traditional.  Just a nit pick.

ALEX SAYS: (inserting manually)

It is something unique in  the formatting of YOUR mail messages.  When
anyone else sends me stuff my mailer handles it properly- if it is
non-HTML it puts > in front of their text and leaves mine plain.  If it
is HTMl it jumps out of indent when I hit return and thus properly
segregates th two.  For some strange reason your messages have not been
doing that.  When I hit return they keep the indent instead of jumping
out of it.  You are the only person that this happens to me with.

JIM says: 
 
Now as to the meat of this, with corrected containment and spellings:
 
Prime
    Free States 
        (Doria, Hetasia, Bengali, Phelosia)
    Dao-Shoa
        (Dao-Shoa)
    Tolnia
        (Tolnia)
    Feudal States
        (Maera, Frankish Lands)
    Old Forest
        (Kymri, High Elves of Yris)
    The Liche's Domain
        (Fire Mountain)
    Northern Lands
        (Kern, Terethi, Dwarvish Lands)
    Southern Lands
        (Venn, Tharuden, The Kereshay, City of Law)
    Eastern Lands
        (Pentarra, Cetania)
    The Far East
        (Rhelania, Dal-Kon)
Prime-Past
    The Golden Empire
        (...?...)
    The Tri-Partite Alliance
        (Koreth, Kestor, Tarroll)
Non-Prime
    Faerie (rare connections)
    Abyss (rare connections)
    Hell (rare connections)
    Keristaen (no direct connections)
    Dragon Home (no direct connections)

ALEX SAYS:
This is fine.

JIM SAYS: 
Kusing came from Kusing Province listed as a mage center in chris's mage
notes.  I assume it is part of something else.

ALEX REPLIES:
Can't remember- I believe Kusing might be one of the dozens of
city-states in the Free States.
 
JIM ASKS:
What about the high elvish city that Gilliam (sp?) comes from.  Is that
in Bengali?

ALEX REPLIES:
It is not a high elven city- it is a wood elven city called COventree. 
Yes it is in Bengali.  Near the now ruined city of El Kahar.
 
JIM ASKS:
Is Koreth currently considered to be in Tharuden?
 I
 find it odd the way you say that Koreth is not part of the Tharuden,
instead it is a human city.  It almost implies that Tharuden is not
populated by humans.  I
assumed that Koreth was part of Tharuden because you mentioned that the
God-King ruled there.

ALEX REPLIES:
No. It is not.  I meant a human city only in that it is one of the three
classical first big human centers of population besides Tharuden.  I
always tend to place Tharuden in a place by itself.  

The God-King did NOT rule in Koreth.  Ever to the best of my knowledge! 
And Koreth is certainly not part of the peninsula of Tharuden.   It is
slightly north and east of Tolnia and 450 miles south and a little west
of Marden.

JIM ASKS:
>From your comments it appeared that Dao-Shoa is its own region rather
than part of either the feudal or free states.

ALEX REPLIES:
Yep.


Talk to you later.

"RE: Lunch tomorrow to talk about Elven Magic ?","I'll be in town, but I'm doing the Forum this weekend.  Thus, no

As far as I know, Kilsorana uses human-type Wizardries, rather
than that frothy, insubstantial Elf-stuff.  (And don't get me
started on the Elvish textile industry... )

I'd be interested in hearing about the results, however.  Have a

    Hey there,
        Is anyone available for lunch on Friday ?
    I would like to have lunch at Uno's (I have a gift
certificate)
    and I think 11:30 or 1:00 would be good times (trying to avoid
lunch crowding).

    My goal is to talk about how elven magic works.

    Asides:

        Chris, can you bring in the Campaign Cartographer disc in
tomorrow
    so that I can try doing some export/import combinations ? Even
if you
    can't lunch with us I can swing by and pick it up. I can drop
it back off
    to you at home on Saturday or Sunday.

       Alex, does Kill-some-wanna's magery work in the same way as
Mordanith's ?

Kilsorana is a funny thing- she is an exception to the rule.  As are
BTW, many of the sea-elves.    She has the potential for both but she
primarily uses what the elves call ""Isolated, Bounded Power Patterns"" 
(aka ""Human Wizardries"").
She was taught primarily the ""Alteration"" pattern.  She was taught not
in the classical Elven manner but rather by an Eldar with a slightly
skewed relationship to the Prime.  (For one thing he doesn't believe in
the Prime.  He thinks of it as a mass delusion that is the cause of most
of the suffering in the world.)

I am more inclined to call Elven mages ""Namers""  and isolate the pattern
more.

"Re: Lunch tomorrow to talk about Elven Magic ?","
This was mostly right on except for:  

High-Elves are more Life-Light-Air rather than Earth-Light.

Wood elves are Nature-Light-Air.

Golden Ones were Life-Fire-Earth-Light from Life-Light

Green Elves a re moslty interbrreding between Wood-ELves and Sea-Elves. 
A Gray or High Elf would never parent a green elf.  (There could be
exceptions.... but...)

Jim said:  

My off the cuff answers without regard to what the GM thinks:
 
The Elvish Hierarchy is a not that straightforward. The common elven
world-view is something like this:
 
Gray-elves (Air-Light), High-elves (Earth-Light), and Wood-elves
(Air-Heads) appear to have 
been designed directly by Correllan as they are now (OK, so some
fine-tuning 
has occurrred over time). Sea-elves appear to be the result of a
Corellan 
approved/aided change (Water in place of Air)  to Gray elves. The
Golden-Ones 
were the result of an unopposed but unsanctioned change to
Fire-Earth-Light from Earth-Light
in some High Elves. Green-Elves are the result of interbreedings between
Sea-Elves and 
other elven races (mostly high). These occur indecently often (at least
7 times in the last 
3000 years !).
 
Sorcery is the elvish common denominator. All the elves appear to be
strong (instinctive) sorcery 
users. Almost all elves use some sort of sorcery every day. Wood-Elves
are the strongest natural 
sorcerers among the elves.
 
Of the more structured magics, Naming is in common use by the Faer-han
and some 70-80% of High-Elves.
With some 20-30% of High-elves using human wizardries.
 
My basic take is that the early period Golden-Ones saw them using
sorceries and naming, and then creating 
some things that we would recognize as human style wizardries. They were
very big into resurrecting  the 
previous epoch's technology.
 
On a side note, I visualize naming as a very broad collection of skills
dealing with the relationship of 
visualizations such as words, gestures, and materials to power patterns.
A true master namer (of which 
I think only a few exist (= Labelas, Adonai, Sylvanus)  could create a
new ""feature"" or ""verb""  in a wizardry
power pattern by verbalizing with power. So to say that a elf is a namer
delineates a broad range of 
possibilities. They may specialize in wizardry power patterns, racial
mana-genetics, or any of a set
of skills that add/enforce structure on power. 
 
This to me is one step removed from the Draconic skill of languaging
which seems to control the Draconic 
relationship to the environment via the dynamic ateration of the
interface from either side. Elves typically only 
control it from environment's side. Ugh, me elf, you are now a new power
pattern. Hello power pattern , I am 
a dragon, how would you like to communicate ?

"BT: Run dates and otherwise","First of all, thanks for an exciting non-combat run, even if it
left me having to explain how we ""kicked butt"" when all we did was
make plans and have dinner.


Alex, Lara provided a date of ""May first"" for our time stamp.
Counting little boxes on my calendar left me with 'Day 121' in the
format I had been using.  Is either of those formats likely to
dominate in the future?  And is the conversion between them easy
to explain?  With more party time spent visiting those poor
benighted Feudal types, this may be a source of unneeded confusion
later on.


Also, is it too early to start looking for another run date?  I
know my February is booking fast, and I wouldn't mind reserving a
spot now.  Alex, since your presence is most vital to the run,
could you post a list of either good or bad dates for the rest of
us to work on?

Also, the party was left in a divided state, with several days of
stuff to work through.  I would like a solo run in there somewhere
(perhaps a weeknight, for 2-3 hours?) and I suspect others might
as well.  If this works for you, perhaps you could discuss those
days as well.

"RE: Run dates and otherwise","Well, I talked to Alex and got answers for the in-game calendar
stuff.

All months are 28 days long.  In addition, there are two
inter-calendral festival weeks, not counted on the 'official'
record, at the summer and winter solstice.  These are six or seven
days, the exact number chosen by local wizards or astrologers.
I'm assuming (for ease of calculation) that the summer week is
always seven days and they mess with the winter week, letting us
not worry about the leap year when counting days.

Using this, May 1st = 5/1 = (5-1)*28 +1 = 113

The year as such would be 12*28 +13 = 350 days long (max), making
it about 5% shorter than ours.  Thus a BT 20-year-old would look
19 to us, and a 40-year-old would look 28.  I can live with that.
(Also, Alex, if you want to mess with the length of the days,
making them, say, around 5% longer, you can do that, too.)

The other interesting date (well, to me) would be Eman's birthday,
on Day 299.

299 = 10*28 +19 = (11-1) +7(summer week) +12 = November 12th.
(Hey!  He's a Scorpio!)

...And I like the seasonality, too.

    I am not sure if I interpretted paragraph two correctly but I
think it is simpler in Alex's world:
    All months =30 days hence
    May 1st = 5/1 = (5-1)*30 +1 = 121
    Oh wait, that is the same number you came up with.  In any
case using 'human' month names should not be too bad and
reinforces seasonality.

Jim - I CC'd you to promote feedback but do not panic if what I say is
different than were you were going.  I am just playing and I acknowedge that
it is your sandbox.

I just had a long discussion with Jim about what elvish magic is all about
and I came to the conclusion that I will have to have my own internal view
if I want to make any sense about anything.  Out of our discussion I did
glean the following things:

All great inventions throughout history were actually made by elves even if
later attributed to other people.
High Elves can choose whether to use the Order/Chaos based patterns or to
use 'Naming'
Gray Elves have no choice and must use 'Naming'
'Naming' essentially means playing with other peoples toys.  As in naming is
a way to deal with other power patterns (Kua-Toa/Slaad and possibly Draconic
according to him) and produce effects.  Elvish magic by itself NEVER
produces any effects except at the discipline level.
Elvish magic never persists outside of the Aura/Concentration of the caster
unless it is supported by someone else.
Elves alter reality easier than sneezing but it does not last as described
above.

This view of elven magic was not particularly useful to me.  It does not
really give any unique character to elven magic at all.  As such I came up
with the following alternate viewpoint which I believe encompasses the same
set of facts.

I would agree. The above stated view is not particularly useful to me either
:-)

I would restate it more like this:

Elves have (Belief/Sorceries/and Disciplines). The discipline of assertion
or creation is a very low level use of will with almost no flavor
of law or chaos. It is low level enough that it could be used to imitate a
Sla'ad or Kwuato cast (why would you want to do that ?). It would not be
a Sla'ad or kwuato cast but it would quack like a duck so.... Elven magery
may be experienced as a ""talk with the anima"" scheme though
that strikes me as more a convention then a requirement. A Faer-Han asserts
something (much like a raver. Shiver !) and it is. How long it lasts and how
strong it is depends on environment. In Faery, by the will of Correllan, it
lasts until something better comes along. In the face of competition from
the
outside (like the prime or a competing CGB) it lasts only as long as the elf
can directly maintain it in the face of that competition. In either case the
negotiation/assertion with the reality may take awhile as the elf adjusts
his assertion to the existing reality. It is impolite to interrupt.

[SLIGHT ASIDE] Before starting into that I thought I should mention
something about the word pattern.  It seems to figure heavily into Jim's
concept of elven magic.  I would assert that wizardry patterns refer to
Kua-Toa created.  Specifically all of the human wizardries are called power
patterns becuase they have some aspect of Order magic in them (even Illusion
which is why humans do not go insane casting it - although the order magic
here is probably the slimmest of frameworks).  As far as the other types of
magic I would say that Dreaming does not really fit the word pattern, it is
a fundamentally different thing.  Where Slaad influences have appeared in
the human wizardries it is like a mold or a virus or a taint on the
underlying Ordered framework and in the case of Illusion the infection is
bigger than the thing it infects.  In a similar sense I would say that
Draconic magic is so fundamentally different than Order magic that a pure
draconic archetype would never be described as a pattern (although there may
be achetypical patterns or archetypical patterners as well as infected
archetypes and archetypical infections).  What I am trying to do is
establish the fundamental difference between the types of magic.

I would disagree. All castings have a pattern OR produce a pattern. Human
wizardries are neat because they have a ~fixed pattern and
produce a ~fixed pattern. Draconic castings produce a pattern (specific to
that cast at that point in reality) that could be interacted
with though there is little to no underlying pattern to the process. Elven
castings are in between. The pattern of the cast exists but adapts
throughout the cast to what is being done. The end result is a usually a
fixed pattern that doesn't last without outside aid.

Having said all of that let us return to elvish magic:

My impression of elivsh magic from the way that it has occured in the world
is that it deals with anima. (Kua-Toa=Objective World, Slaad=Dream,
Dragon=Archetype, Elf=Anima).  As such an elvish approach to magic would be
to treat everything in the world as an animate entity and interact with it
appropriately.  Sing to the trees and ask them to grow a certain way.  Sing
to the crystals and ask them to grow a certain way.  Talk to the stars and
ask them for prophecies. etc.

A matter of flavor but I would say soimething more like:
[Jim JM] . it deals with anima (aka Animate Reality or slippery reality)  .
As such an elvish approach to magic would be to treat everything in the
world as an animate reality  and interact with it appropriately.
Continually Assert to the trees adjusting to reflect the changes necessary
to allow the assertion to come to fruition in this current reality. It may
be brute force or it may be subtle negotiation.

Where does Jim and Naming fit into this.  My contention is that Mordenaith
is not a generalist elven mage but in fact an extreme specialist.  He
specializes in talking with human wizardry patterns and asking them to do
things for him.  In doing this he has developed the whole specialized
vocabulary of naming and tweaking patterns and verbs, etc.  In fact a true
generalist elven mage would talk to anything.  Why ask the geomatic pattern
to make a wall when you can just ask the earth to rise up and form itself
into a wall?  The reason is that since Mordenaith specializes he is MUCH
more fluent in the language and interactions of patterns, they are pretty
powerful and talking to the earth is probably slower and more likely to give
you lip about doing stuff.  I would suspect that most elven mages specialize
not becuase the fundamental actions are different but because it is
important to know the specific thing you are talking to VERY well.  As a
special case of this elvish enchantment is probably not ussualyy done by
talking the the enchantment pattern but ussually done by talking to humans
and having a (strangely elvish in viewpoint) knowledge of human
interactions.


As such I would propose that an elvish mage would have skills like the
following:
A W:skill in the voice being used (for Jim power patterns may be one voice,
for an earthsinger earth might be a voice)
A lore skill (G: or not?)  in each kind of thing being talked to (for Jim
each power pattern e.g. Levator, for an earthsinger each kind of earth.  I
plan on Stone, Metal, Crystal and Earth(i.e.Dirt)).
A variety of interaction within that voice (for jim the set of verbs, for an
earth singer another set of verbs like grow, animate, take the form of, have
the senses of, ...)

Well I definitely don't agree with the skill set.

Mordanith probably has

Discipline: Naming (Aka interact assertions with animate reality)
G:Abjuration Power Pattern
Spell (really a kata of naming assertions and sorcerous actions):Ward

To cast Mordanith would use naming (there is no activation involved), use
G:Abjuration power pattern as a
general, and run though the kata.

The verbs are the part I am least sure about becuase I am not sure I have
distinguished between them and the sorceries.

The wizardry power patterns are combinations and extensions of various
sorceries. The difference is not that great. The verb is
merely the ""hook"" into the matrix that (typicaly) invokes a more powerful
version of the sorcery.

In this way Sigmund would be an EarthSinger in the same way that Mordenaith
is a Namer and they would both be elven magics.  As a side note I do not see
elven magics as having a pattern anymore than draconic or slaad magic.  What
would it have?  Community is the wrong word.  I will have to think about
that.  For the moment lets call it a spiritview (please replace this term).

It is interesting to think then:  Mordenaith deals with the spiritview of
patterns, is there a pattern for spiritviewing (healing or necromancy?), can
you have a tainted spritiview or an archetypical spiritview?  Does an
archetype have a spirit (independant of its Avatars?).

Certainly there are specializations in the use of naming. Naming is merely
the term for the Correllan-Given and learned skills
involving assertions to a reality. What part of reality you want to work
with the most governs your speciality. Want to be Aliantha the
Elven Healer ? You can use Human Wizardries directly if you are a high elf
or you can use namings to interact with the individual life/nature/elemental
patterns that make up a living entity. Human Wizardries would be faster and
more powerful but far less flexible.

I actually expect that while Mordanith has specialized in Wizardry Power
Patterns he has some skill in other patterns such as dreamwalking and
_The Pattern_.

Nuff'Said

Agreed.

    Well I definitely don't agree with the skill set.

    Mordanith probably has

    Discipline: Naming (Aka interact assertions with animate reality)
    G:Abjuration Power Pattern
    Spell (really a kata of naming assertions and sorcerous actions):Ward

Just out of curiosity if a spell is a Kata do you have skill also in the
atomic actions of which the kata is composed.  For example WamBamBoom is a
kata composed of two sword techniques, 3 power sorceries, an accelerate, a
manuever and enforce reality.  As such I have skill in each of those
individual actions as well as the kata itself.  I am sure you have sorcery
skills up the yin-yang but do you also plan to take skill in specific
naming-assertions?
[Jim JM] I have to talk to Sanda about what specific skills would be
involved. I think of ""Assertion"" as one skill and the ""verbs"" in a Wizardry
power Pattern as another so I thought I would take skills in the verbs of
the popwer pattern.

    To cast Mordanith would use naming (there is no activation involved),
use G:Abjuration power pattern as a
    general, and run though the kata.

    I actually expect that while Mordanith has specialized in Wizardry Power
Patterns he has some skill in other patterns such as dreamwalking and
    _The Pattern_.

I am still a little unclear how dreamwalking (which is in essence the
antithesis of pattern) can have a pattern though I can easily see how this
could relate to _The Pattern_(tm).
[Jim JM] I think it may be fundamental to the elven viewpoint that
everything has a pattern even if the pattern has no strict
edges.  Each reality is itself a complex pattern and what differs is what
the will to word ratio.

    Agreed.

Subject: Elven Magic


    New strategy.  Rather than think about how elvish magic would work let
me state what I would desire out of Sigmund's elvish magic skills.

    1.    My elvish magics ought to be completely different in character
from my other magics.  Currently Sigmund has one Magic area in three of the
four types of magic.

    For Kua-Toa magic he has a Drawing wizardry with the corresponding
Kua-Toa discipline skills.  For Draconic magic he is a priest/avatar of the
Fortu racial archetype.  For Slaad magic he is a dreamwalker and has various
skills in calling from and manipulating the dream.  Each of these skills are
so completely different from the others that there really is no comparison.
Trying to use a single word like magic to cover all three would really be a
stretch.

    I am sure there are examples of each of these kinds of magic that are
much closer to each other.  For example the Tharuden Royal College of Will
Working (Kua-Toa) and the Rhellenian Will Working School (Slaad) are very
similar and I am sure there is some draconicly influenced 'Wizardry like'
thing which is very similar.  The point is that whether or not these things
exist Sigmund does not have these kinds of skills.  Sigmund tends to learn
things at their core.  One might say that the colleges mentioned above are
all human schools and hence are closer becuase the human outlook has blended
them and none of them are pure.  It is my contention (completely unsupported
by anything so crass as facts or consensus opinions) that in their pure
forms each of these three types of magic have nothing in common at all and
that there pure forms are never seen in the world today.  Sigmund tries to
study each of these magics as close to the pure form as possible.

    Hmmm. Our world views differ a bit here. I see them as having more in
common then not. The inputs and the outputs are the same and the techniques
for tweaking bits and bytes are the same. Everything else is window
dressing. Of course, it is IMPORTANT window dressing.
    Try and convince a Smalltalk aficiando that C is a better language and
stand back.

    OK, those last two paragraphs were getting a bit to pretentious.  The
point is that, to be honest, the only reason I am interested in studying
elvish magic is to be the first on my block to collect all four.  And the
only reason that appeals to me is that I currently perceive each of the four
types of magic as having a complely different and independant character.
So, as far as the way they work for Sigmund, I would like each of them to
operate in a completely different manner.  It does not matter to me if other
people in the world use them in ways that minimize their differences, I just
want to be able to use them in ways that maximize their differences.

    I think that one of the things that jars my ""elven-sense"" is that the
sing-songy crunchy granola look-and-feel you are giving to elven mageries is
often true yet I read your statements as ""That is all that Elven Magic is"".
I think of the Faer-Han as having taken a basic group of perceptions and
possible actions and having developed a whole slew of martial arts like
styles. At bottom you have the ""kick"", ""punch"" and other basic applications
of force to achieve a desired effect and much of the hand waving and
mysticism is there to make it easier to encompass. So a martial artist
doesn't think ""application of first fore-knuckle to solar plexus to a depth
of 3.5 inches taking into account all environmental factors such as mass,
current movement vector, etc while keeping my center mass the optimal
distance from my opponent"". Instead the martial artist thinks about becoming
one with his opponent and doing a front punch to the solar plexus. In effect
the Martial Artist is taught a simplified form of access to their physical
abilities to speed response and action.

    A  Faer-Han namer is someone who has developed their basic ""actions"" and
""perceptions"" at a very low level and can choose to apply them at that
level. So a namer would indeed be doing very fundamental steps along the
length of a cast. The downside is that if they have no experience with the
reality patterns they are trying to manipulate they would have to do
perceptions during the entire process and thus they would take a great deal
longer than others might. This is definitely the magic of a race with to
much time on their hands. In computer terms  ""Namers sing the body assembly""
patching bin-hex as they go..

    The many simplified schools of Kata and techniques such as the Geomancy
school you describe below exist for those Faer-Han or Quentar who do not
want to put the effort into learning the patterns at the detailed level  or
for those races , like the wood-elves, that have limited access to the
perceptions needed. I can easily believe that many such schools came into
being during the Golden Empire when the Moldy-Ones needed simplified forms
of magery for their troops and battle mages. I also believe that Mordanith
himself may have learned some of his magic at this level (he always was
impatient).

    If the desire is to collect all four than any of the Elven ""schools""
would do. They probably have enough of the base flexibility to give you a
good flavor. If the desire is to ""learn things at their core."" I would
suggest that you do Naming directly. I don't think that Naming lends itself
well to use by normal humans because it depends on the caster being
""un-sane"" in that they have no built-in reality gyroscope running in the
background.

    2.    Here are the things which I would like to do with an elvish based
geomantic magic.  For the sake of convenience I am going to call this
EarthSinging but I am not attached to any particular meta-physics or skill
set (he claims naively).

    General things to be manipulated:  Crystals, Stone, Metals

    Spells/Abilities/Verb Combinations/whatever
        a.. Grow (Shape) Crystals - This could be used for growing
specialized crystals for use in all sorts of things.  It could also be used
to create a crystal forest or to coat something (like a rod) with crystals
all over it by coaxing them to grow on it.
        b.. Grow (Shape) Stone - This could be used to grow stone into a
specific shape.  Especially useful for growing tall sinous towers or curving
walls and domes.  You could use this to stoneshape a whole in a wall but it
would be slow.  You might as well use the sorcery for that.
        c.. Grow (Shape) Metal - This could be used to weave the garins of a
metal in just the right way to make an excellant sword blade.
        d.. EarthWalk/Stone Form - Is this a sorcery or an EarthSinging
thing?  Take the form of earth and move through the earth easily.
        e.. Awaken Memory Crystal - Take a specially grown crystal and
awaken the earthspirit inside it to take on a new level of conciousness
thereby making it really useful for programming tasks or building net server
nodes.
        f.. Awaken Haalite Crystal - (I know that Chris already knows how to
make Haalite so this may be impossible) - Take a specially grown crystal and
awaken the earthspirit inside it to take on a new level of conciousness
thereby making it really useful for supporting someone elses reality.
        g.. Animate Metal - Take a metal earthspirit and give it the power
to control its shape and form easily.  This could be used in a spell to
allow metal wire to come to life and wrap around someone and it could be
used in the long term to make a morphing weapon like the multi-blade.
        h.. Animate Stone - Same concept but with stone.  Good for short
term golems and earths hands in the short term.  Great for making those
entrance ways that look like a giant mouth in the long term.
        i.. Commune w/ Earth - Once again Sorcery or Ability?  All I know is
that the earth is everywhere and if you have the patience to talk to it the
stories it could tell.  Where is my enemy?  How do I sneak into the castle?
5000 years ago who was at the battle on this plain?
        j.. Summon Stone Elemental - Sure everything in the earth has a
spiriti but some of them are clearly bigger than others.  Get me one of the
biggies that is self animate to pummel my enemies or tote my bails.  Do I
need a seperate skill to Enchant the elemental once I have summoned it?
        k.. Create Warders - It strikes me that earth and order are linked.
This ability would take a set of earth spirits and dedicate them to
enforcing the reality in an area.  It might be a specific reality or they
may just be insuring that the conversation changes slowly.  This might be a
real bummer for any chaos magic in the area or even any magic at all.
    I am not sure how all of these would relate to the earth sorceries?  I
figure S:Commune w/ Earth and S:Earth Form would still be good though they
would cover the basic voice and form whereas their earthsinger counterparts
would be much more persuasive/mobile.  I figure S:Summon Earth is way
different than summon elemental but really important for those low earth
environments (got to get the earthspirits there first befoer you can talk to
them).  Grow would be enhanced versions of this.  I would think EarthShape
and EarthBind would be considered crass by Earthsingers (why push when you
can ask) but might still be good backup skills or perhaps the fast way of
doing it and its OK if you apologize afterwards.

    I do not see EarthSinging as fast and more involved with creating things
(specialized earth spirits) than performing effects.

    I suppose in the long term there might be interesting things to explore
in terms of Dirt (Earth+Nature) and Magma (Earth+Fire) but for now this is
my focus.
    OK, thats it.  What do you guys think?

"E: Random Gaming Blurb","    Point counter point ""Sigmund you ignorant slut !""

    What is the Pattern(Mordanith's Opinion)
    The Pattern is a discipline 3 working that established a broadband net
broadcast of packets. Each Elf can resonate to and take in a packet. In
doing so their coordinates will come to match those of the packet. Walking
the Pattern consists of finding and accepting the correct packets and
    accepting the portion of the coordinates you need to use (very tricky).

    What is it like to walk the Pattern
    Very much like the chronicles  of Amber. The more skilled the walker the
more abrupt the jumps in reality can be. In effect the elf is reaching with
innate perceptions to determine what packets (and thus locales) are
available. The nearer realities (planes) have more packets in any given
area.

    What are the Advantages of walking the Pattern
        a.. The Pattern  goes everywhere.  It is an integral part of most of
the realities (including the prime). And there is an elf who works at
ensuring that it continues (Tyriontil). There are areas where the Pattern is
inaccessible, even though it exists there.
        b.. I cannot be teleportal trapped stepping into or out of the
Pattern.
        c.. I can pick the destination with some precision.
        d.. My buddy Correllan is there.
    What are the Disadvantages of travelling through the Net
        a.. It is not instantaneous. Faster than walking but still taking  a
matter of minutes.
        b.. It is VERY dangerous if you do not know where you are going
since a wrong turn can lose  you BIG TIME !
        c.. You sometimes get random encounters.  But since most of the
walkers are Elven , whats to fear ?
        d.. If you travel with me and I get killed it is hard for anyone
else to get out of the Pattern.

        e.. The real downside is that the packets are easily suppressed by
wards. They are low power and easily deflected. A skilled act of will can
lift the suppression but it is chancy at best.

    Actually for casual transportation it is probably safest to take a
Ghurka.
    [Jim JM] Hah ! I bet that Marden has 18 Ghurka pile-ups ! No thanks !

"Sigmund:Gaming","I think Sigmund is going to start studying a new and previously unrecognized kind of magic.  Dwarven magic.  I think people may only recognize the four basic kinds of magic (Kua-Toa, Slaad, Draconic & Elven) becuase they do not know what to look for.  Here is what I think it would look like:

Dwarvish magic relies on verbal components but mostly on somatic components.  Occasionally material components are employed as well with the most common component being a stiff shot of whisky.  Dwarvish magic works on all creatures and can even be used in the Abyss.

Here are some of the spells Sigmund was considering:

Levitate Other - Take a shot of whiskey, grab the target by the collar and belt and fling them.
Heal Dwarf - Administer shots of whiskey until the pain goes away.
Dwarvish Divination - This spell requires a human as a material component.  Slowly break the humans fingers one at a time grinning and laughing while you do so until the human tells you waht you want to know.
Dispell Magic - Take a shot of whiskey and ignore the spell being dispelled.  It probably won't kill you.
Illusion - Say you want to appear to be an elephant.  Walk up to each person in the room and say ""I am an elephant"".  Once they stop laughing pummel them severely.  Repeat this process until they agree with you.  When new people enter the area of effect this may need to be repeated.

least six months:-) People shouldn't panic- the changes are not so
drastic as ones we have had in the past, and, for the first time, we
have some serious levels of documentation.  

I am going to ask/have asked different people take on different tasks 
inside the rule set:

Chris Carlucci is working on Magic.  His current pre-occupation is 
    Foci and Keys. As soon as he is done with that section I will 
    include that.  
Mark: I am going to ask Jim Mochel and you to work on Kata- whose 
    design is, admittedly, a mess. Jim for his knowledge, enthusiasm, 
    and character self-interest in the topic, you for your 
    level-headedness. :-):-)
Britt: I am going to ask you to create an inventory of TCF skills. 
    Even if you don't have time, an inventory of Borealis's alone 
    would double what I have in the skill list now!  :-)

What are some other things that would be worth fleshing out?  Please 
let me know what you would like to work on if anything!:-)  Even the
smallest contributions.

Chris is also creating a database of all the names, places, races,
cultural groups, and other pieces of data from my fantasy campaign.
Right now he is doing it in a MS Word97 Outline format that he is going
to turn into a HTML document.  Does somebody have a good, easy, idea on
how to manage that information in a way that anyone can get at it?  

The ""BETA"" copy of the rules is on-line at:

"Bardic Tales Revision 6.0 ","This is a good start!  Write in with reactions and new proposals.

I am sending this to the people who are most likely to care about
changes to Rev 6.0 of Bardic Tales.  

I want to use this list as a forum for discussing those changes.  Your
input is needed- or who knows what I will do with the system!;-)

If you want off- please let me know!

Legitimate topics are proposed changes to the system, reactions to
proposed changes to the system, and really good dirt and gossip.. oh,
never mind.

			TOPICS:

NEW LEVEL FACTOR STAT BASIS

Right now the stat basis for level factor is (STAT-10) claculated as a
skill of that rank.  Now the stat basis for level factor will be:
	(STAT - 10)*2.
It makes stats more important in the beginning and beefs up lower level
characters a little.

NEW LEVEL FACTORS or LOSING SKILL FACTOR

I don't think so.  The level factors are a game mechanism to allow for
skill bleed and cross-skill support.  The way ""it really works"" would be
a logistical nightmare to model (because skills are grouped both by
neuro-muscular patterns of a very complicated  sort but also cognitive
associations and patterns which depend alot on the context the skills
are learned in, etc.  GROSS!)  Skill Factor is the level factor for
crafts and trades to go into- primarily those that are hands-on, skilled
labor.  It is also something of a hold-all for those skills you just
can't put anywhere else.!:-)  Am willing to hear suggestions that
enhance playability and are intuitively easy for the player to deal
with.

GUNS:

All guns are taking a -40 in rev 6.0.  They are also getting +4 damage.
You may also add your rank -2 as damage to your gun skill.

PRIMARY STATS:

I want to add build as a primary stat.  It already influences: defense,
weight, HTK, PAB, and MVM.  Why not make it a primary?

SO: 5 physical stats, and four mental.  And three attributes: height,
race, and gender.

I have decided to have age not be a stat with dependant variables in the
system.  Age is a special effect!;-) like hair color!

Yes. 

I figure I want a rank 10 gun man who rolls a full hit to do more damage
than a rank 1 gun man who rolls a full hit.  (Yeah, yeah, that's it- the
adavanced gun man tracks the target better so it's a MORE direct hit
than the direct hit of an amateur.. yeah, yeah... wait a minute... that
actually makes sense!;-))

I have decided, unless persuaded otherwise, to apply all the skill rules
to all the primary skills. (he ducks avoiding the horrible consequences
he imagines are coming...)

Ummmm... why not?  One of the most agile untrained people in a country
has a 27% 
better chance at AGF stuff than one of the clumsiest untrained people in
that 
country?   That actually appeals to me.  It is a wide range but I wanted
stats to
have a more profound imapact on skills.  I didn't want to go as far as
SH( untrained is SB*1.5(stats range is 5 to 25 so: 7.5 to 37.5, thus 30
point differential) but it gives
stats a little more weight.  

Other people's thoughts?

It is a lot- I am open to altering this.  But a 10 level factor is
nothing to 
sneeze at.  A person with a 50 LVF only gets +5 XPM.  50 is a lot!

"Re: Bardic Tales Revision 6.0","Be careful what you wish for.  Here are my thoughts...

On level factors modifying XP rolls:
Be careful taking advice from a character with a level factor over 100.
There is a chance his view of the world might be a tad skewed. :-)
Personally I do not think factor/10 is too much, and as a sworn math
athiest I greatly prefer a simple decimal place shift over even the most
basic division.  If that does not convince you, think of it as a persons
ability to teach themself in a field they understand, then compare it to
the mod for someone else teaching them (rank 1 Teacher = 30 Lvl factor).

On guns:
Just for the record I think the changes to the gun system are basically
good (even though Stephen got severly slammed by them in combo with
enforcement of previously uninforced mods).  I am very happy to see
damage per rank added back in for guns--I really like to see game
mechanics applied as broadly as possible.

I would like to propose two changes though.  First, I think all guns
should have a zero difficulty modifier.  I agree with getting rid of the
bonus to hit, and with the pattern you have set up (that short barrels
are less accurate than long).  However, you have already modeled this
with ranges.  Short barrel guns have shorter ranges, and will take mods
for range sooner than long barrel guns.  This also has the advantage of
getting rid of one more set of modifiers to remember.  (I am also a big
fan of simplification.)

I do not remember the mods to damage for range, but I thought they were
pretty severe.  Do bullets lose that much velocity by long and extra
long range?  (I do not know.)  From a playability standpoint, if I hit
somebody at extra long range (which Stephen now has a base -7% chance to
do now), I would be really disappointed if it only did a couple points
of damage.  On such a low percentage shot, I would feel robbed as a
player if the bullet didn't actually hurt a little when it hit! :-)

BT Questions (Many Gun Related):
1)  What are the effects of a general skill (like Pankido)?  +6%, what
plus to spd & damage?
2)  What skill offsets mods from a moving target?  You mentioned in a
very old e-mail a ""targeting perception"" which cuts move mods in half
when rolled successfully.  Is this the same as MCFperception?  Is this
the current way the skill works?  If MCF perception is not the same
skill, what are the differences?
3)  What are the movement mods for shooter and target?  Under what
circumstances does Acrobatic Combat cancel shooter move mods?
4)  How do speed points work, particularly in relation to how guns work
with a separate draw, target and trigger pull?  How do you speed up each
of these actions or part actions?

There are plenty more where those came from....

Generals act just like a Secondary- +3% / Rank, (Rank-2)/2 damage and
speed points. +6%! Wow! That would make Chuck gross! ;-)

I'm curious on this stuff too, as to its applications in the HtH arena.

Each has to be treated separately because there are two levels of buying
off. For simple ""cheap"" actions, they may be bought off one for one. For
""attack"" actions, it cost 10 SPD points to cut the action in half, until
you reach 1 count. To cut it in half below 1 count costs 20 SPD. I know
Alex is considering changing the class of some of these actions.. . . .

Given that Mordanith is VERY intelligent, and VERY discerning, and is

getting to RANK 4 in half the rolls is so bad.  Seriously!

I don't like the split at 100- it is TOO artificial and I like to follow
Geoff's KISS path as much as possible... I can get a cap though.
What about half your discernment, or (INT + DSC)/4?  NO!  Even easier-
It can't exceed your XPM!  I sort of like that!  It is brutal though on
slow or stupid characters.  They then get NO XPM bonus based on level
factor.   Hmmm..... We might have to go with (INT + DSC)/4 because of
that... I don't know- must think!

I assume buying off cheap actions is equivalent to, for example, making a passive perception which I was always told was four speed points.  Other things however, like activating an internal capability (sorry this is Sigmund) could take 1 count.

Also for normal actions I thought it was 10 points to halve it (7.5 points if the original number was odd/round up).  After halving the first time it is 10 points per additional count dropped until you reach one.  After one I don't know what happens next.  This yields:

Starting at 8: 10=4,20=3,30=2,40=1
instead of: 10=4, 20=2, 30=1
Starting at 7 would yield: 8=4, 18=3, 28=2, 38=1

Speed does some to be an area of mystery for most people.  I have always found it rather straightforward but I am not sure if the straightforward system that I have been using is the actual BT system or if I just like math.

*AHEM* Oops!:-)  But just think... that guard only missed by 4%, an
extra 40% would have put him into full damage at point-blank with a
long-shell, full metal jacket out of an AK-47.  Now THAT is a scary
thought!

The scale of to-hit mods for the various types of guns 
was actually thought out very carefully on the mechanics side and on
the realism-simulation side. Rifles really are THAT much better than
pistols and shotguns are really that much worse(with a few exceptions).
So I am not going to make all projectile weapons the same difficulty
AND, unless confronted with data otherwise I am going to keep the
current spread.  Therefore, the question becomes:  ""Which gun is the 
zero?"" not ""Will guns be a zero?""  My current decision is that long
barrelled rifle is the zero mark. I did this because when I ran the
numbers on pistols I started to get something matching the empirical
data I had when I had RANK 4 policemen in short-range firefights with
defending criminals(who had rank 2s in applicable skills).  Also a RANK
8 shooter using a pistol against a non-defending, small target could
match current competition statistics(assuming RANK 8 called shot and
quickstirke skills).  Rank 10 shooters and higher are still scary but
hey- that's fantasy! 

So the ""-40"" to guns wasn't a number I made up.  It was the most
workable number that generated realistic AND playable results.  AND 
all that being said I am not wedded to it.  I just need you to tell me 
why you think it isn't playable...or fun.... or whatever.

>This also has the advantage of

Agreed- but as always I am riding the razor edge of having a playable
system and one that- as much as our scope allows- maps on to ""what 
would really happen"" 

>I do not remember the mods to damage for range, but I thought they were
>pretty severe.  

Point-Blank:	+40 to-hit	2*DAM  <--NOTE TO-HIT CHANGE!!!!
Short:		+0		+0
Medium :	-20		-2 DAM
Long		-40		-4 DAM
XLong		-160		-16 DAM

>Do bullets lose that much velocity by long and extra
>long range?  (I do not know.)  

Yep.  Pretty severe loss of velocity over time.  The actual curve
differs drastically based on the type of round.  An M-16 slug for
instance, destabilizes almost immediately and begins tumbling. After a
certain point it is still moving pretty fast- and will cover alot of
ground- but is basically useless as a projectile weapon.  On the other
hand a long-shell rifle round from a sniper rifle has tremendous spin
and has a very sharp flying profile.  It will stay stable in flight for
a long time -even into what we would call ""long range"".

Get used to it!:-);-)  The best way to interact with extra-long range 
is as not in range.  It is included in the system because bullets do
travel a lot farther than they are effective, and the occasional 
zany character will go for the hail mary shot.  (<-notice the sports
analogy.  I am practicing:-)) Now... a sniper with a rank 6 in rifle,
that has a tripod, a scope, is braced, in stance, and sets up...can
actually make a shot into extra-long range.   
BTW:  In WW II there are stories of ""MASH"" units half a mile behind 
the front line having rounds- presumably at the edge of extra-long
range- ""falling"" into their soup!

Anyelse with real-world data to substantiate this- Captain Research 
perhaps?

Targeting Perception and MCF Perception are one and the same skill. 
Yes- when you roll a successful MCF PER roll on a moving target you 
can cut your to-hit mods based on target movement in half.

>3)  What are the movement mods for shooter and target?  

They are the same mods determined individually and are cumulative.
If self moving: -30% to-hit
If target moving: -30% to-hit
for every 1 ft/ct in velocity differential: -10% to-hit
	exception: if you are moving head on towards each other

		5% per ft/ct

Currently none.  Combat Acrobatics is a secondary to Shoot-While-Move
though... Shoot-While Move is a Support Skill that gives you 3% per
Rank against your to-hit mods for moving.  

I am not sure what the applications to HtH would be Mark... Flying

Yea- what he said.  Except:

10 Speed points cuts a skill in half.  Thereafter, every ten speed
points will drop the WSD linearly by one count until one is reached.  
Then 20 points cuts it in half.

It used to be that you could buy off the Draw, and the Targeting at 2
 SPD per count.  I am going to change that in REV 6 unless otherwise 
enrolled.

There will be three seperate actions: Draw, Target, and FIre.  Draw
speed is based on the length of weapon and the ""holster"".  Firing will 
always be two counts- base trigger-pull speed.  Targeting changes from
weapon to weapon, but so long as the weapon is pointed in the 
right hex it will be 4 counts.

If your target stays in the same hex(60 degree angle centered on 
your line of fire) and range (the weapon's range categories) you do 
not have to re-target.  You can keep pulling the trigger.  Any change 
in target, range, or hex causes the shooter to need to re-target.

Right now I am saying they are three seperate actions that need to be
sped up exactly as any skill.  To ease game play though i would allow
you to roll Quickstrike once at the beginning of a pre-set draw, target,
and fire sequence and have that quickstike apply to all three actions.
So: (react) + DRAW_SPEED + (react) + TARGET + (react) + PULL_TRIGGER
TARGET= 4 counts, PULL_TRIGGER= 2 counts
Then: (react) + PULL_TRIGGER + (react) + PULL_TRIGGER... etc. 
	(if on same opponent, in same hex, at same range)

BTW: Drawing, targeting and firing is slow:  one second(five counts) is
considered a laser fast draw-shoot time.  And that is with competition
holsters and cutdown guns, with hand over the gun....

I realize it is more complex, but how about a little more detail with
respect to the angle of the movement? I can see it ranging from 0 (head
on) to 90- a nice 1 to 10 progression? Seems like it should be possible
to do it without too much pain. Any geometry weenies out there?

How about hitting someone while being thrown? Or falling? Or running? Or

In the line of simplification- it would be nice if everything fell into
1 for 1 (or is it 2/1?) or halved at 10. Kind of chunky, but there is a
lot to remember otherwise!

Wait! You lost me! A single quickstike could be for all 3 actions? Do
you get to use all the speedpoints each time, or do they run down as the
actions stack up? I'm confused!

Those damn Army testers- they made me look bad!;-)  None the less- the
main point about velocity drop off is still true whether the bullets are
""yawing"" or ""tumbling"".

If you like- I am confident in my data:-)- M-16 ammo tumbling for
instance!:-)

I am afraid to add this but as an advanced rule we could have head-on 
be 1% per ft/ct differential mods and every 10%deflection off zero = 
+1% per feet per count cost to-hit up to say 90% deflection. 

That would give us a 1 to 10 range of cost.  I would do that but am I
getting too complicated? (I can't believe I just said that!;-))

Oh- yea.  I guess it is the same.  Hmmm... If you were falling I 
would declare that an unstable platform and give you a -50 and 
charge you moving mods!  Otherwise jump, roll, other combat 
acrobatic- Ahhhhhhh!  Yes- you could take combat acrobatics as a 
support skill like shoot while move to do melee action while 
executing a movement

So are there other base mods, or are you talking -50 + a minus for the #
of ft/ct? If that is the case, why wouldn't you use the same -30? Just
for consistency. ;-) Currently, a Jump attack is -30, with each rank in
Jump reducing that minus by 3% ( at least that is the last thing I have
on my sheet!).  Sounds like maybe this should be 6%/Rank, and allow
Combat Acro as more like a General at 3%. Then Guns would have a Fire
While Active at 3%, and more specific skills like Fire While Diving,
Fire While Rolling. Fire While Walking/Running at 6%. It is unified- I
don't know if it works. What do you think? Jeff? Was this at all
coherent?

I'd say you have to give the player a choice- but that they have to
state which way they are going to do it before the first die is rolled!!
Also, with the above change of no cheap buyoffs, not every sequence is
going to fall this neatly into a single quickstrike. Could make combat
more tedious as things that snuck in quickly will now require a full
reaction roll sequence. Will tend to stretch the difference between
Schmoes and Pros even farther.

"Re: BTR.6 : Gun and System Questions","More commentary... Here is my guns manifesto...

Barrel Length Mods:
   You have already got a fairly sever (not necessarily inaccurate)
system for range mods, and longer barrel weapons will have longer
ranges.  You have penalized both chance to hit and damage as a function
of range.  Adding a % difference to the base chance based on barrel
length effectively penalizes short barrel weapons in a third way.  I
agree with the idea, I just think it has been sufficiently modeled.  I
also like no mods because it is easy to remember.  If you really feel
the average gun should have a less than zero chance to be used by an
untrained person (without stance, set-up etc) then I suggest a uniform
-10% or whatever works.

Range Mods:
   The % to hit mods for distance seem good (as long as you intend that
nobody would waste the lead on an extra-long range shot).  I still have
a problem with the damage mod at extra long range.  At -16, a level 5
person firing a pistol of moderate power (a .357), if they made 1/2
their % chance (at a -160%) would do full damage of exactly zero
points.  The a fully successful shot from a reasonably skilled gunman
with a decent gun would bounce off the target.  I'm sure it would sting
a little though, but only if it is not a ""glancing blow.""  I would
propose a -8 mod to damage as being sufficient in conjunction with a
-160% chance.  (BTW, the M-16 arguement is a bit of a tangent.  The fact
that an M-16 is not effective at long distances means that it has a
shorter range than a long barreled rifle.  Your mods apply to each gun
at its own individual extra long range--a very different number of feet
for each weapon!)
   Oh yeah, and I think 2x damage at point blank range is just too
disgusting (except maybe for a shotgun).  A +40 to hit will give boost
level of success from miss to grazing to success to crit, thereby giving
more damage.  If you want to add a +4 to damage to make it even grosser
I won't complain, but people will drop like flies with double damage.

Target Angular Movement Mods:
   In my relatively simple system I apply full mods for a target
traveling between 90 and 45 degrees of the shooter, half mods for 45 to
""close to 0"" and no mods if the target is moving (relatively) straight
toward or away from the shooter.  For your more ""granular"" system, you
could apply (Angle + 10)% of the mods.  In other words, a target
traveling perpendicular would be 90 + 10 = 100% = full mods, and a
straight on target would be 0 + 10 = 10% = 1/10th the mods.  It is
logical but cumbersome--you'll probably like it ;-)

Target Velocity Movement Mods:
   I think the target velocity movement mods may be too high, or that
there may be a better model.  No police data for you, but based on my
paintball experience it seems too high.  I have been hit, and have hit
plenty of people while the target in question was running/sprinting.  I
don't set up set up significantly and have no other gun skills.  Lets be
generous and make me rank 4, and generous again and give me another 10%
in Dex/MCF and THB, and put me in stance.  I have a total of 60%
(assuming my paintball gun is actually a long barrel rifle, which it is
not--for a short barrel this only gets worse).  A sprinter will cover
6'/ct for a -60%.  Additionally they are moving, another -30%.
Statistically none of us novices should ever have hit anyone unless they
were standing still.  And a paintball gun is a pretty crappy weapon.  I
suggest this--keep the -10% per foot per count, but drop the -30% for a
moving target.  Replace the -30% with a rule like, no set up unless you
make a successful tracking roll.  The reason it is so easy to hit a
stationary target (vs. a moving target) is that you can set up, and do
not have to move your hand arm to track as you fire.  You have already
covered the tracking with the mods for angular movement (described
above) which you are certain to implement ;-), all that's left is the
set-up.
   I do like the fact that running is now more effective vs guns than
activating defense.  I still think defense against a gun (except maybe
at point blank range) is a pretty silly concept.  The army teaches
soldiers 3 second dashes to cover, not ""float like a butterfly, sting
like a bee.""

Speed Points:
   OK as a math athiest I can handle the 2 for 1 buy-down and the 10 for
1/2 speed buy-down system.  Beyond that my head starts to hurt.  Every
time I want to speed up an action I will slow down the game.  I second
Mark's comment.  Good enough--leave it alone.  I also think you do not
want to institute the
10-points-buys-you-1/2-and-2-points-per-one-thereafter system.  This
would actually make it proportionally harder to speed up a long slow
action, and proportionally easier to speed up an already fast action.
If Chuck and Stephen (and probably Mordanith and Morpheus) are grossing
you out with fractional count actions, how about 10 buys you 1/2, 20
buys you 1/4, 40 buys you 1/8, 80 buys you 1/16?  It is similar at the
low end of high speed actions, but puts a damper on things getting too
ridiculous.

Gun Quick Strike:
   I now understand how gun speeds work, thanks.  If it makes a
difference, in important situations I will almost certainly want three
separate rolls.  What is the distinction between the 4 ct targeting time
and MCF set-up?  Is it the basic minimum time needed to target in order
to fire at zero mods?  If so, what is the penalty for ""shooting from the
hip"" or taking a snap-shot?  Presumably there would be a skill that
would offset these penalties.  A successful quick strike roll would
reduce the time needed for targeting and a snapshot skill would reduce
the mods for firing without taking targeting time.

Other Stuff:
   I am not sure about Mark's suggestion for the application of
Acrobatic Combat.  It certainly should apply to striking while jumping,
being thrown, etc., but I do not know about the 3% vs. 6%.  What skills
give 6% per rank?  I only know of specific Called Shot skills.  A +6% is
pretty powerful unless the mods are pretty severe.  I would almost
suggest making everything +3% again and softening some of the most
severe mods.
   An interesting observation.  If I have a high Punch and Pankido
skill, and want to increase my chance to quick-strike, do a called shot
head, and block, what are the skills I should take?  The answer?  Kick!
Kick will give me a +3% to each of these punching actions while the
specific support skill only gives +3 to that particular action.  That
does not feel right to me.  Support skills should contribute more than
secondaries.  My suggestions would be to allow support skills to
contribute more than secondaries (which would get ugly with all BT's
carefully balanced mods) or alternatively broaden the scope of each
support skill.  Turn skills into MCF quickstrike, PCF called shot head,
etc.  That way you at least get a little more return for your
investment, even if it is still better to take secondaries.
   And one last question.  Do support skills (like quick strike or
called shot) get secondaries?

   There was probably more, but my fingers hurt.  I didn't realize how
much I missed good game design discussions.

Sure- call it -30% BUT- there is a falling mod.  These numbers must be

falling.

Ummm .. no we need fast perception rules...

I am thinking:
You can use SPEED POINTS to make perception rolls(4 SPD points gives you
a 
passive roll, 8 gives you a full roll.  

I think, due to the on-going data analysis nature of perception there
has to be
a way to model what you get on the fly.

HERE IS ONE: Everytime you have a reaction you can make a
passive(half-bsc) 
perception roll.

It will take longer to use a gun- unless you have a guaranteed negative 
init like Stephen and I believe Desciante now as well.  It will also 
tend to stretch that difference between skilled and unskilled which I
like.
ONe of the hard things about a system that has delusions of modeling
reality
is you have to work to keep the high level characters alive!:-)

Just to be clear- I don't think it is severe.  For example:

A .38 Parabellum round shot from a full-barrelled, rifled pistol by a
RANK 4.0 shooter does 14 + 2d6(avg: 21). At medium 
range it does 12+2d6(avg: 19).  At long range it does 10+2d6(avg:17).
NOW- at extra-long range it does 2d6-2, but we know all about 
extra-long range:-).  Long range is only about a 20% drop in damage 
from short range.  Actually not that severe(which models reality- 
there is an intial rapid drop off in velocity  out of the muzzle 
and then a slow, steady decline). 

> Adding a % difference to the base chance based on barrel
> length effectively penalizes short barrel weapons in a third way. 

Not really- range mods are based on caliber of the round.  The Pro 
always carries a Tek shotgun pistol with him.  It is a short-barrelled 
pistol that fires a 20-gage shotgun slug.   Short-barrelled weapons 
are not penalized by caliber except that most of them happen to be 
low-caliber.

Here is my problem with this, and why I don't understand your point (I 
am probably being dense) What is an ""average gun""- the difference
between 
a sub-machine gun and a shpotgun and a pistol  and a assualt rifle and 
a sniper rifle are as severe as a dagger, a Claymore, a long sword, 
and a lance!!!  In Bardic Tales modeling guns as a ""gun"" would like be 
like saying ""bladed melee weapon"".  

Also- again the -40 wasn't random.  It gives you a spread of chances to
hit 
that balance out the grossity of guns from a playability standpoint, and 
models the available data (I am not even going to go into the discussion 
I had this morning with Jim where he said something like ""Your velocity 
model is about right but you know there is no correlation between round 
velocity and damage,""  I told him to shut up.;-)

Let me re-name extra-long-range for you:  it is
the-distance-at-which-the
now-already-useless-round-will-travel-until-it-bounces-off-someone-like-
a-pebble range.;-)

I have no committment to giving people reasonable chance to do damage at 
extra-long range.  Let me give you an example.  

Take a low velocity round coming out of a pistol (this example is more 
dramatic with a high velocity round out of a rifle but this will show 
my point)  Let us assume that the muzzle velocity is 1000 ft/second.
That means: 1000 * .03125 = 31.25 feet is short range.
SO:
Point-Blank = 8 feet
Short Range = 31 feet
Medium Range= 62 feet
Long Range = 620 feet
Extra-Long Range = 1240 feet

A shot with a pistol of 200 yards is an unbelievable shot.  It is at the
edge
of what is doing... and it is possible.  Say it is a.38 round, shot by a
rank 4
shooter.  At OVER 620 feet, and up to 1240 feet (assuming she could hit)
she 
would do an average damage of 5 HTK.  If you look up in Jane's or a
weapons's 
guide you will find very few pistols(including high power ones- which
this isn't)
that have a MAXIMUM full range of even 620 feet, never mind 1240.  

Is anyone else as disturbe by this as Geoff?  Should I take out extra
long 
range and have a sidebar rule that says ""BTW: bullets will travel as far
as 
twice long range after they lose their power.""?  I am serious...

I agree- it is also inconsistant with the rest of the damage scale. 
Mark and 
I were talking about +16 at point-blank?  Or maybe as low as +8?  BTW:
They do
do a lot of damage at point blank.  If a bullet hits before the initial
velocity
drop off it is going to hit a LOT harder than a feet later!;-)

Done- sold to the man in combat armor!  I agree- in the simple rules I
will probably follow your lead Geoff and do 45 degree increments.  I
will include the ANGLE/10 +1 rule as an advanced option.

Also after hearing several arguments I concede on the 10%.  It is too
high.  
The top will be 5% per foot per count as opposed to 10%.  And the base
will 
be 20%.

Something was lost in translation here.  We are not thinking of changing
the 
system of speed points.  Are you suggesting a change?
Current system:
10 points buys you half(if an even speed, otherwise 8 ponts buys you
half, 
rounded up)
Thereafter every ten points buys you one count until you reach one.  

It used to be that certain actions were exceptions- targeting with a
gun, 
the first two counts of a jump, draws.  Those you could buy off at 2 
speedpoints per count.  Our proposal is to eliminate, or severely limit,
the 
exceptions.  Have everything follow the same rule.

Yes- absolutely.   Taking a snap-shot is the same as firing blind.  You 
take a -50 to the snap-shot and don't have to roll a targeting roll.

still need to be pointing in the right hex)

I thought about that but Mark is suggesting the opposite- allow for very
support skills and have them be 6% and have general support skills be
3%

I am for broadening - but not that far.  Ialready have the support
skills 
support the family of skills not a specific primary skill- like guns, or 
bladed weapons!  It makes me itch but is the only way.

If they are rolled as primaries.  Support skills that are modifying a
primary 
do not get secondaries.  So yes to Quickstrike, and no to called
shot.

"RE: BTR.6 : Gun and System Questions","This is in response to Mark's statement:

So no more fast perceptions? This will lead to a major change in how HtH combat goes!!

This may or may not make it obvious whether I am running a combat system much like, but not actually, the one used in BT.

I have used the quick buyoff system where a bunch of extra speed points (I forget how many) could be translated into a quick passive perception but for the most part I don't use this.

Usually what I do is to do a perception,  do a number of linked presets and then perceive again.   I love short streams of presets as a form of on the fly half-florentine/half-kata - I hate long sets of presets cause I feel like I am losing touch with whats going on in the combat.  When I do perceptions I always do passive perceptions which I have been running as four counts (this is because Sigmund has revolting perception numbers so why waste the extra counts).  I also never assume that I need to react in order to perceive, it has always seemed redundant.  So my secquence of actions would normally be:

Passive Perception...Decide on actions
React
Move Forward & Disable Targets Wards
Preset - React
Preset - Stab with short sword
Preset - React
Preset - Lunge backwards and evade
Passive Perception...

At my levels the passive perceptions are one count actions (>20SPD from natural speed and ranks in perception) so I still feel like they are fast.  They are certainly not as zero count passive perceptions from extra speed points but that doesn't seem to bad.  Also in actual game mechanics I appear to get very general passive perceptions for free (as part of roleplaying).  This is usually the kind of thing like ""I do a combat perception on a fighter and I get free information about how many magic items he or she has since I have a 12 SCF perception"".

BTW: Related question.  I was talking to Jim M about guns and he mentioned that PAB does not apply against bullets.  I have a spell which causes slivers of metal to be projected at a target at high velocities, does PAB apply against this attack?  Magic is only used to sliver off the metal and get it up to velocity, all damage and targeting are purely physical (this is effectively a Gauss Gun spell).

behind, but my thoughts on:

>> NEW LEVEL FACTOR STAT BASIS

>Other people's thoughts?

Thinking of a starting character, I'd be much less likely to want to role
play a character with Stats below 10 if the math had that much of a
negative impact.

  Stat-5 gives a boost to *most* characters at low levels, not just those
with stats above 10, and that is the time when they really need it.  At
higher levels, lower stats are an inconvenience and a focus for role
playing (like that character that has a horse with better stats than he has
..) but at low levels the increased negative effect of (stat-10)*2 could
be deadly.

  With stat-5, high stat characters have an impact between stat-10 and
(stat-10)*2, low level characters get a boost.  The only drawback (from a
balance perspective) is that the negative impact is almost eliminated.

  I suggest (stat-10)*2 with no negative LVF's.  The stat basis creates a
negative impact on the LVF total which makes it take longer before you get
a bonus to your rolls.
  If one person has a stat of 6 and another has a stat of 18, assuming they
have identical skills, when the one with a stat of 6 has skills high enough
to give him an LVF of 1, there is still the 27 point spread between the LVF
of the person with a 6 stat and the person with an 18 stat.  (actually it
seems to be a 28 point spread, but that may be an error in my tables)

Okay... I don't think that is a bad thing!  The intention of this 
change is to partially redress the imbalance between stats and 
skills in Bardic Tales.  

>   Stat-5 gives a boost to *most* characters at low levels, not just >those with stats above 10, and that is the time when they really

Don't forget that most people start the game with a stat pool that
would give them 12-14 across the board.  No one needs to start the game
with a stat less than ten and if they do it is because they got
something out of it- 5 stat points buy 10 ISL points or almost three
levels of advantage.

STAT-5 just doesn't mean much very quickly when every character gets 
10% per skill rank.  This change was intended to have stats be more
impactful.  Thus the *2.  As for those poor babieswith a -2% LVF 
because they have a nine- COME ON!

It doesn't really hurt untill you get to 7 and lower- and it SHOULD 
hurt then!

See above.  It is not deadly- they just won't be any good at things 
they have a stat less than 7 in.

This seems wierd- why not penalize people who have low stats? We reward
people who have high stats...

One useful thing that Sigmund takes adavntage of is that perception
rolls (active or passive- 
but not freebies) last over time.  (DRV + RANK) in counts.  During this
time you may make passive

It depends on the type of damage: if it is piercing PAB is half

PAB is not effective.

Pook: Talk to me off-line on whether your spell does projectile damage
or not.

Okay... I don't think that is a bad thing!  The intention of this 
change is to partially redress the imbalance between stats and 
skills in Bardic Tales.

Don't forget that most people start the game with a stat pool that
would give them 12-14 across the board.  No one needs to start the game
with a stat less than ten and if they do it is because they got
something out of it- 5 stat points buy 10 ISL points or almost three
levels of advantage.

STAT-5 just doesn't mean much very quickly when every character gets 
10% per skill rank.  This change was intended to have stats be more
impactful.  Thus the *2.  As for those poor babieswith a -2% LVF 
because they have a nine- COME ON!

It doesn't really hurt untill you get to 7 and lower- and it SHOULD 
hurt then!

This seems wierd- why not penalize people who have low stats? We reward
people who have high stats...

"More Gun & General BT Thoughts","OK, here's my rebuttal about barrel length and extra long range, then
I'll shut up.

Barrel Length:
   If you stood 5 feet from the end of my gun and held perfectly still,
I do not believe I would be 25% more likely to hit you with a long rifle
than with a short pistol.  I understand and agree with the fact that
range mods are by caliber of ammo, and that weapon length increases
accuracy.  Why not make barrel length modify range?  You could do your
muzzle velocity calculation for range, then add or subtract 10% of that
value for each increment of barrel length, for example.

Extra-Long Range:
   Sure, ask the martial artists and mages if anybody is worried about
extra-long gun ranges ;-)  The fact is that if you establish a range,
you should expect that people are going to try to use it.  The other
problem I have with the current system is that it is not consistent.  A
short pistol is completely useless, damage wise, at extra long range
(-16 to damage), but a .50 cal weapon would still do a fair amount of
damage at extra long range.  Before you argue that heavy calibers are
more effective at longer distances, keep in mind that ranges are already
a function of caliber.  A .50 cal will have a much longer distance for
XL range than a small caliber.  There should be a distance for both
weapons (the end of extra long range) where the round will do an average
of zero damage.  Here are three mechanisms that I think would be more
realistic (if more complex).
   Decrease damage proportionally by range.  For example, 3/4 damage at
medium range, 1/2 at long range, 1/4 at extra long range.  This has the
same problem but to a lesser degree, but is fairly simple to apply.
   I like this one better if you can make it work.  You know how called
shot mods come off your chance, but go back onto your chance to crit?
Could you apply range mods to increase your chances of a ""grazing"" shot
instead of a full damage shot?
   My current favorite.  Subtract damage per foot.  Say -1 dam per
200'.  This would make a Walther (avg dam = 15) -6 to -12 at the
beginning and end of extra long range.  A Browning .357 would be 17 -7
to -15.  Each would do a couple points at the end of extra long range.
If that is too much you could look at 150'.  I don't know about your
ranges/damages for high cal long rifles, but at 200' one mile would be
-26, at 150' it would be -35.  The disad is keeping track of the
distance of the target (in feet vs. just range).  The advantage is that
it is a more linear, and I think from what you have described, a more
realistic system.

Movement Mods:
   A -5% with a -20% base seems much more reasonable.  And I was not
complaining--I was complimenting you on a system improvement ;-)
   What all the mods for the shooter?  Move speed, unstable platform,
defense activated, etc.?

Speed Points:
   I took your basic idea for speed points and, but I changed it
somewhat.  Five points will drop you action to 3/4 speed, 10 drops it to
half.  Another 10 drops it to half again (1/4 total), etc.  I like this
better (for my system anyway) because all skills are decreased
proportionally.  The way I understand the BT system, it is actually
easier to speed up quick actions than slow ones.  To drop a 32 count
action to 1/4 of its speed would cost 10 (drops to 16) plus 10 X 8
(drops to 8) for a total of 90 speed points to get to 1/4 speed.  To
drop a 4 count action to 1/4 speed would cost 10 + 10 = 20.  Did I do
that right?  If so, I think this is a major problem.
   If I understand your system, then I do propose a change.  How about
10 drops you to 1/2, 20 (total) to 1/4, 40 (total) to 1/8th, etc.?  Play
with that if you do not like the exact numbers.  I agree that all skills
should follow the same rules as much a possible.  The above system
should work for all the ""hard to buy down"" skills.

Questions:
   What do general skills (ie. Pankido) do?  They add 3% per rank.  I
heard they also add damage and speed?  I also seem to remember Chuck
""activating"" his Pankido.  Is that still part of the system?  If so,
what does activating do for you?
   What kinds of support skills are there and how do they work.  I know
of some that increase a chance for a specific action, most of which
offset penalties (like Called Shot).  I know of some which give you
points (like Quick Strike).  Are there other types?  You can increase
the effect of Quick Strike by rolling against it.  Does it do anything
for you if you miss or do not roll?  Can you roll against a skill like
Called Shot?  If so, what does it do for you?  Are skills other than
specific area called shot skills that add 6% per rank?

   If you can answer all of these questions, I think I will know
everything I need to know in order to shoot someone again! ;-)

Generals do not need to be activated any longer, unless you are using it

BEFORE eveyone goes crazy - Jim's numbers here are NOT correct.  repeat
these are not the numbers those characters would get.

To translate a current character:
1) Take the current build, which will range from lithe(-6) to huge (+6)
and record that number.
2) Take the bone size, which is either small(-2), average(0), or big
(+2) and record that number
3) Take any race or gender mods you have to build.  Record those.
3) Add (1), (2) and (3) together.
4) Add 3) to the number 11.  Record this number- it is your BUILD
statistic.

Now calculate your HTK:  BLD*2 + CON + (DRV-10)/2

I would love it if people told me what their new numbers are.  email me
privately ith the result and I will compile and post it.  The last thing
we need on this list is more posts!;-)

I wasn't suggesting that we not penalize people with low stats, just not
low level people with low stats.  Keep in mind, your original mail message
said:

""It makes stats more important in the beginning and beefs up lower level
characters a little.""

  That is only half true.  It beefs up lower level characters only if they
have above-10 stats.  If they have below-10 stats, it makes it more
difficult for them.  My suggestion did not model reality.  It was there
only to give a boost at low levels to a player who chose to take a low stat
for his character.

That is probably true - but when you leave point-blank range that starts
to alter a lot.  Ask people you know who shoots guns:  a long barrel
rifle is 
a LOT more accurate than a short pistol.  A LOT!  It may even be that
25% 
doesn't do it justice.  You see in one domain I agree with you- it would
be nice to have a linear curve like you describe late rin your post. 
But the truth is a gun is not a gun is not a gun.   The relationship to
range and accuracy, and range and damage is not the same for all guns. 
That is why we have redundant systems in Bardic Tales.  Damage comes
from all sorts of 
places and it creates a realistic ""look-n-feel"" with guns.  Somebody
smart once said: ""a consistant system is not a good model of reality,
and a good model of reality cannot be a consistant system"".  I want to
have the numbers for shotgun behave something like a shotgun in real
life.  I want someone who 
uses a shotgun in real life to use one in my system and go ""Yeah- that's
what 
would happen!"" I know I won't quite achieve that, but I am trying
hard... and
still have the system playable and easy for people who could care less!

See above... Heavier slugs actually are still damaging when they are in 
their post-stable flight, smaller, lighter rounds are less so.  So-
independant of range modification for TO-HIT which still SUCKS in
post-stabilized flight- you should see an escalated damage effectiveness 
at extra-long range as you move up in the mass of the projectile.

See above!  What is realistic is not always what is simply modellable,
unfortunately.

This isn't bad- except damage drop seems to be small- no more than
20-25% until the round de-stabilizes(ignoring those first few feet out
of the barrel)
then there is a massive drop off.   (I am still using velocity as the
damage delta for range- in the gun industry there are massive flame wars
as to whether mass or velocity is the primary key to damage)

Good idea- too complicated for implementation.  At least for me- can you

A great system- but doesn't model bullet behaviour quite as much as I
want 
to.   AM i being too anal retentive about that?  Possibly.  But I have
done the same with other weapons and martical arts as well- we just have
more data on gun behaviour.  I am clear there arte alo areas- like
driving, for instance, where none of this rigor has happened at all:-)

I don't have time to answer that now- it will be in the rev. 6.0
Player's Handbook Alpha release, which is going to come out May 1st (no
matter what condition it is in I am printng it out, or e-mailing it, and
distributing 
it for your perusal)

I will then get your comments and by June 1st the Beta will be out.  
I expect lock down on Rev. 6 on July 1st.

Hmmm.. I really need to think about this.  A couple of things went into
the current system.  
ONE: We wanted actions to have automatic bottom line speeds that it was 
really hard to speed up beyond that.  We settled on half based on gut
instinct, feel ,and some ambiguous martial-arts data and speed-shooting
data. 
TWO: Keeping people from speeding actions up to much is desirable- it
keeps play more interesting if people need to take time to do things. 
So I want a system where people can speed up and it is harsh to do so
THREE:  The numbers a really easy right now to figure.  When we start
dividing twenty into the range between 7 and 4 then... How many speed
points to go 6, etc....blah, blah.    Seems like an added level of
complication while I 
am tryoing to be simpler.

"Re[2]: More Gun & General BT Thoughts","     Quotes from Alex:
     
You see in one domain I agree with you- it would be nice to have a 
linear curve like you describe later in your post. But the truth is a 
gun is not a gun is not a gun.   The relationship to range and 
accuracy, and range and damage is not the same for all guns. That is 
why we have redundant systems in Bardic Tales.  Damage comes from all 
sorts of places and it creates a realistic ""look-n-feel"" with guns.  

I want someone who uses a shotgun in real life to use one in my system 
and go ""Yeah- that's what would happen!"" I know I won't quite achieve 
that, but I am trying hard... 

A great system- but doesn't model bullet behaviour quite as much as I 
want to.   Am I being too anal retentive about that?  Possibly.  But I 
have done the same with other weapons and martial arts as well- we just 
have more data on gun behaviour.  I am clear there are also areas- like 
driving, for instance, where none of this rigor has happened at all:-)


General response from Myth.

I know there are people who want to know the range of their weapon to the 
millimeter, and who will cheerfully argue until 3am whether or not that sniper 
two miles away should have been able to puncture a steel-belted radial.

I just don't think you should be designing your system for them.

Your goal has been stated as 'look-and-feel' of real gun combat, and I think
you
are allowing the plethora of available data to overwhelm the playability aspect

of the whole thing.

I realize you will lose strict accuracy, but I am unsure of how 20 minutes of 
measuring range, angle, and wind velocity will help the play of a firefight.


So much for the curmudgeon's view.

"Re: More Gun & General BT Thoughts","I eagerly await rev 6.0.  Here are some final (?) thoughts...

Range Mods & Barrel Length:
   I promised to shut up and I am a man of my word.  *sigh*

HTK:
   I like the fact that body size has more to do with HTK in the new
system.  Drive has a very minimal effect on HTK.  Just an observation.

Stats & Level Factors:
   I also like the increase in importance of stats (like you couldn't
guess that), but Chris is right that it is pretty harsh on low level
characters with a low stat.  It may convince all but the really hardcore
roleplayers not to even consider a below average stat.  A compromise
might be Stat-10, *2 if positive or *1 if negative.

Speed Points:
   For the sake of simplicity and sanity, in my system I have set the
base speed of any action as the time it takes an average person to do an
action with an average quality result, whether it is building a house or
throwing a punch.  It should require extra luck, skill, and/or the
sacrifice of quality to decrease the time of the action, and it should
be exponentially more difficult to make a task shorter and shorter.  Of
course I hate exponentials, so I tried to come up with something
similar.  The net result is that most people can cut an action to 3/4 or
1/2 and still have some chance of success.  People cutting a skill to
1/4 have to be very good/lucky.
   BT generates more speed points than my system so this is a bit
awkward, but a rough translation to BT might be--1 SP buys off 1 count
until you reach 10 SP (=3/4 speed) or 20 SP (=1/2 speed, round up).
Thereafter, 2 SP buys off 1 count until 40 (=1/4 speed).  Then 4 SP buys
off one count until 80 (=1/8 speed).  You must pay the larger cost, so
cutting a 2 count action to 1 count would automatically cost 20.  I
realize it defies some laws of physics and is not a completely smooth
system, but it seems to play well and cover a pretty broad range of
action durations.  Your mileage may vary.

<Myth>

If HTK is used as a measure of physical (ie, structural) damage, then drive 
shouldn't really be a factor at all; determined people are just as injured 
as non-determined ones.  I would think the difference to be in how they 
react to injury, with the more-determined person better able to ignore an 
injury.

If, on the other hand, you want to have HTK damage measure the efficiency 
drop due to injury, then DR should be included, and Willpower saves should 
probably not be allowed.

Stats & Level Factors:
   I also like the increase in importance of stats (like you couldn't

roleplayers not to even consider a below average stat.  A compromise 
might be Stat-10, *2 if positive or *1 if negative.
     
<Myth>

A couple of points, not all in reference to Jeff's comments:

1) Low-stat characters will be somewhat penalized by not getting the bonus 
that high-stat characters get.  This will serve as somewhat of a deterrent 
already, particularly is people are just looking at it as a way to et 
points.  I think additional penalties fall into the 'punitive damages' 
category and might well be unnecessary.

2) I like the idea of one formula for level factor, without special cases 
for below ten, or already-high level factor or whatever.  

3) I am immediately suspicious of rule changes made to help (or restrict) 
certain kinds of characters.  The fact is that clumsy people play sports 
badly, or at least less well than non-clumsy people of the same skill 
level.  Intelligent people have an easier time learning history people than 
others.  Characters with low stats will have problems, and the payer should 
know that going in.  After that, let the dice fall where they may.

Speed Points:
   For the sake of simplicity and sanity, in my system I have set the
base speed of any action as the time it takes an average person to do an 
action with an average quality result, whether it is building a house or 
throwing a punch.  [lots of atheistic math not quoted]
     
<Myth>

I think I have to agree with Jeff, here.  It makes more sense to me for an 
8-count action to be as difficult to reduce to 2 counts as a 32-count 
action is to reduce to 8 counts.

Aside from additional penalties due to physics (less-than-1-count actions, 
for instance), a simple geometric system should cover it.  Perhaps charging 
10 speed points to reduce to 1/2, and an additional 10 for each half of the 
remainder.  Charge an additional 10 points to go to a 1-count action, and 
you're there.

(Okay, you can poke holes in my math now.)

Puh-leeese!  It isn't that bad!  If you have a 5 in a stat- a 5, mind
you-
a single rank in the skill will cancel out your negative mod to zero.

I hate to admit it, but a variation on this might work and might be more
realistic.
Maybe 10(or 8 if it is an odd number- I won't keep repeating this but it
will 
always be or 8 or or 16 for odd numbers) to cut it in half.  20 more
points evenly 
distributed to go to 1/4, and 30 points evenly distributed to take it to
1/8.
It is more consistant but a little less easy to calculate than the
current system.
People hit by it most are people with long weapon speeds(who can be
faster) and people
with low weapon speeds(fists, daggers, guns) who will find it more
expensive to 
be faster.
What do you guys think?

That's clear- though we have to include the fanatics too.  Otherwise we
get lonely.
Right, Jim?

Well- here's the beauty of it- once us fanatics get done we just put a
bunch of 
range numbers onto guns and then when some new gamer asks us why that
number is 
so high/low we can say: Because it says so!:-)

I agree with you AND I want our playable numbers to be as good ballpark
numbers as 
we can get.

Thanks.

So fist used to be 10 => 2 counts, 10/count lower. So 20 put it at 1
count. Now 30 for 1 count. What is the minus/speed point? 5%?

That is accurate- it would be 30 speed points to drop a fist to one
count. 
You can buy each speed point with (which is what I think you were
asking):
10% to-hit, 2 DAM, or 1 negative INIT point. 

Good- I have just done some number crunching- that system works!  I like
it.
Any major objections?  (Chuck- just think how slow those gun are going
to 
be now!;-)  If not i think we will go that way in Rev. 6.0.

Yep.  Sounds good to me!  You can probably do better than a minus 100
as well but I am clear only the best will do one count punches- or
gun shots.  Both of these things make me happy.

"RE: General BT Thoughts (re: speed et al from Geoff)","I hate to jump in so late in the game, but I like the current system.  
The new system works and I would not be heartbroken if it were 
implemented but I prefer the existing mechanism for the following
reasons:

1. Suddenly speed is flattened out for high level characters
If Sigmund had 30 speed points the difference between a power 
blast[16] (which is a sorcery) and a short sword strike[6] becomes 
4 cts compared to 2 cts as opposed to the 6 cts to 1 ct comparison 
in the current system.  This is not necessarily a bad thing but it 
dramatically changes the balance of the game. I like the fact that 
fighters are much faster than mages even at high levels and I would
not want it to change.

2. We have spent a lot of time ""playtesting"" the existing system
and I have not found any problems with it.  If it ain't broke don't fix it.

This is true to an extent- it is flatter, rather than flattened though.
This is why I hesitated toeven consider the new system- I like that 
it is difficult to move below half of weapon speed.  

In comparing the old to the new system 8 WSD actions are the mid-point.
AT 8 WSD the action speed up is the same in both systems.  The further
you get away from 8 in both directions the more extreme the difference.

Correct!

Hmmm... I am not sure drastic is the right word.  Most actions float
between 4 and 12 count actions.  Also- it is only a 3 count difference. 
I mean, what could happen in 3 counts!?;-)  Very fast weapons(6 and 
under) are most penalized.  However- PCF gives much more(twice) to SPD
than SCF, and fighters will still be much faster.  Note that in your
example Sigmund's short sword is still twice as fast as his power blast.

See above.  Still true- just not as ""faster"".

Very true.  However, we have been in a constant struglle to not turn
battles into two count hack-hack-drop scenario's and leave enough 
time for movement and tactics to engage.  This actually slows down the
hyperfast weapons a little and speeds up the claymores.  One of the
unrealistic things about Bardic Tales is that a skilled guy with a
Claymore gets trashed against a skilled guy with a knife- every time!  
Bardic Tales favors speed over damage.   This is still true but I this
evens the playing field a little bit.  

Does that make sense?  So - it ain't broke, but this is a relatively
small change and resolves some issues I have been working on.  I am 
enrollable in ""it ain't broke so don't fix it"" model.  I am just 
leaning towards this as worth it...

Talk to me- is it not worth in your eyes, Pook?  Anyone else?

Actually the ""average"" sorcery is around a 10 count action.  Some of the
sorcery 
perceptions can be an 8 count action!! The ""average"" spell is around 20
counts.

Myth:

Well, E-man, at least approves of the change.  Even though I would 
classify him as a mid-level mage in a high-level party, he routinely gets 
out-sped by fighters, mages, and monsters.  (Actually, Mordenith can 
generally act twice before E-man finishes his initial perception roll.)  
To be fair, I think this is appropriate; he is still largely a non-combat 
mage, tends to look before acting, and is lower-level than the others he 
hangs out with (including monsters).  Still, I find the -extent- of the 
difference somewhat annoying.  (I would mention 'unrealistic', but I can't 
seem to find any good data on real-world spellcasting times.)

Fighters will still be faster.  (Unfortunately, so will monsters.)  I like 
the change.

Myth:

Well, with faster spells and sorceries, mages will be less inclined to 
grasp desperately at these devices for battlefield survival. <grin>

Seriously, part of the vast popularity of both triggers and batteries is 
the fact that they let mages be a little more effective (and dodge some 
of the restraints that the world puts on them).  If the base spells and 
sorceries can be more easily sped up, then there will be less demand for 
'cheaters'.

"BTR.6: Books, spell crystals, and data storage","A funny thing happened to me on the way home from a run Sunday night.
Bestowed upon me was the knowledge of how books and spell crystals would
probably be run.  Alex requested I send it to the list for your comments.

Alex wants to have books, spell crystals and similar items have an effect
through training.  Each would have three variables:

1) Author's rank in Teaching filtered through some type of text-book design
   skill.  This would give the book's ""Teachers Rank in Teaching"" (TRT).

2) Author's rank in the skill(s) that you wish to train in filtered through
   the author's reading/writing skills.

3) The length of the book.  This would give the maximum number of hours that
   could be gained from the book or crystal (ie. you can't study just one
   basic text on Geomancy to become Rank 20 without doing anything else)

Once this process is determined, it should be possible to quickly generate
the books, crystals, CD-ROM's, memory wafers, etc. that we find during
adventuring.  

A few items that I would like to throw in:

A) My suggestion below would be the exception, not the rule.  Most books
   would be generated like this one:
   ""Geomancy by Kheldar""
   TRT = 4 (Either Kheldar was a lousy teacher or just poor in textbook
design)
   Effective Rank in Geomancy = 12 (kheldar was good at Geomancy and writing)
   Length of Book = 100 hours of training

B) It is entirely possible that a book might provide multiple  benefits.  
   For example, a book on ""Traditional Ward Structures of Dorian Mages"" might
   contain a background of warding concepts, a general discussion of basic
   spell constructs, an example of major and minor wards, and some discussion
   of the history of warding.  This would translate to the ability to train
   in W:Warding or W:Abjuration (possibly at a decreased percentage), the
   ability to train in a couple sorcery Ward's, a Spell (M:) and a 
   Ritual (R:), and Warding Lore.

C) I suggest that a comparison of your skill rank and the books skill rank
   determine whether you can use it or not just like in regular training.  
   For example, a rank 1 book shouldn't be very useful to someone with a
   rank 9 skill.  A rank 4 book could be used by someone with a rank 5 skill
   because it is within 20% of the trainee's rank (per Alex's training rules).
   Of course, there is always the possibility that there is something unique
   in a specific book.  The GM should determine this however.

D) I'd also like to suggest that most books have a usage length related to
   rank.  Some books might have a rank 4.  I might need to have a minimum
   rank of 2 in order to use the information in the book and not be able to
   use it after I go beyond rank 5.  I might also need rank 4 in a rune set
   or written language in order to use that particular book.

E) Most books might just have the ability to give you enough training to get 
   to rank 1 in a skill.  After all, how often would you expect to find a book
   that could teach you how to rip a hole in the fabric of reality?

A very sensible approach, and remarkably simple.  I like it.

>> Each would have three variables: <<

[Uh-oh.]
     
>> 1) Author's rank in Teaching filtered through some type of text-book design
   skill.  This would give the book's ""Teachers Rank in Teaching"" (TRT). <<
   
Another TLA, but a good basic determination of how good a 'teacher' the book
is.
     
>> 2) Author's rank in the skill(s) that you wish to train in filtered through
   the author's reading/writing skills. <<
   
The effective skill of the book.  Nice.
     
>> 3) The length of the book.  This would give the maximum number of hours that
     could be gained from the book or crystal <<
     
Mm-hm.  So this would be (subject to the author's design) 5 hours on 
Subject A, 20 hours on Subject B, etc.  This would be reflected 
(determined?) by how long the author spends producing the work in question, 
and in turn would determine the size of the book.

The author's skill in the subject matter and/or their writing ability might 
also factor in here.  Not everyone can write the Great Dorian Textbook.

     
     
>> A) My suggestion below would be the exception, not the rule.  Most books
   would be generated like this one:
   ""Geomancy by Kheldar""
   TRT = 4 (Either Kheldar was a lousy teacher or just poor in textbook
design)
   Effective Rank in Geomancy = 12 (Kheldar was good at Geomancy and writing) 
   Length of Book = 100 hours of training <<
   
So the book sounds like a fairly good treatment of a general subject, and would

probably teach a fair bit of W:Geomancy.  (Can I reserve my copy now?  Can I
get
it autographed?)
     
>> B) It is entirely possible that a book might provide multiple  benefits.
   For example, a book on ""Traditional Ward Structures of Dorian Mages"" might 
   contain a background of warding concepts, a general discussion of basic
spell 
   constructs, an example of major and minor wards, and some discussion of the 
   history of warding. <<
   
I think most textbooks would tend to take this approach, trying to produce 
someone with a general competence in the area, and a good idea of what has been

done and which experiments might be dangerous to try in a populated area.  Even

somewhat specific works (""Hetasian Wards and Counterspells,"" by W. King) would 
probably talk about the history, development, and uses of these skills, as well

as the skill itself.

It might be analogous to the skill assortments found in 'package deals'; a book

on Dorian Sorcery would cover each of the sorcery types, their uses and 
limitations, and maybe an example or two of each.  A book on bodyguarding would

cover awareness, tactics of ambushers, basic traps, and probably touch on 
contract law.

     
>> C) I suggest that a comparison of your skill rank and the books skill rank
   determine whether you can use it or not just like in regular training. <<
   
Good idea.  Advanced students won't get much from basic texts.  Perhaps the 
""with partner"" rules might apply if the book and student are close enough in 
level.  If texts are general, they might be expert on aspects of the field 
that a student might not have mastered; the studious bodyguard, fresh from the 
military, might only need to brush up on his trap knowledge and (sadly) skip 
the section on contract law entirely.
     
>> D) I'd also like to suggest that most books have a usage length related to
   rank. <<
     
Hmmm.  Another good point.  Most books will be written for a target 
audience.  Calculus texts will assume that the reader is familiar with more 
basic maths.  Badly written books might miss this target.  Perhaps removing 
a rank of Book Teaching Skill for each difference of 1 between the students 
intended rank and his actual rank?  (Not sure I like that, but it's 
simple.)

The limitation on reading the book also seems logical.  Some sort of 
reading skill roll should probably be made, with the effective rank 
determining how much of the book is assimilated.

     
     All in all, an interesting set of ideas.

 I just finished reading through the pre-release of version 6.0, and I
have a couple comments, mostly minor.  Of course, please disregard
anything that has changed in the released version.

I like the fact that STM is now an average (surprise, surprise).  I
think that is more representative of the number of XP invested in a
character regardless of their distribution across level factors.  It is
also easier to calculate.

I think it is possible to teach a skill to someone who has a higher rank
in the skill, particularly for physical skills.  Consider a coach for an
olympic athelete.  The coach would probably have a very high rank, but
the competing athlete would likely have a higher one.  Maybe you could
modify learning time by 15 min * (students skill rank - teacher's skill
rank), with the student's skill not to exceed the teachers skill plus
rank in teaching.  It seems trivial, but when you have people at high
levels training with good teachers, it may be important.

I still think Horsemanship belongs in VHF :-)  It is basically knowledge
of steering a large (animate) vehicle and knowing the types of terrain
it can handle, turning radius, etc.  Just like a motorcycle or other
vehicle, if you fail your roll, THEN you need AGL to stay on.  (Much
harder for a horse than a car!).  Also, I imagine cart/chariot driving
is a VHF skill, and I would think they ought to be related to
Horsemanship pretty closely.

Here's the big one:  Speed.  I would like to propose several changes to
the speed system.  The system you wrote up is different in effect from
the one I proposed, and I also have had some other thoughts.  Here
goes...

First (with some admitted self interest on this one), I think MCF should
go into speed.  When you originally wrote the speed formula you were
probably thinking about bows and slings, and maybe snipers, but not Wild
West style gunslingers or Dangerous Jazz style commando shootouts.  I
imagine this is a similar line of reasoning to the one that added SCF to
speed.

Second, I think the splitting of speed into action and reaction is
awkward.  That change seemed to be a patch-job to keep high reaction
speeds under control, and I think it could be taken care of with some
other system changes.  I think much of the problem is that it is much
easier to accumulate negative initiative than it is to suffer the
minuses to hit or to damage.  I think you can re-tune your speed point
system to allow low level characters some chance of speeding up actions
while preventing high level characters from acting in 1/8th counts, and
simplify the system at the same time.  I propose the followining:

One speed point is generated by 1 pt negative initiative, a -5% to hit,
or a -1 to damage.  One-for-one reduction of positive initiative to
zero.  Beyond zero, 10 pts drops an action to 3/4 speed, 20 (total)
drops it to half speed, 40 (total) drops it to quarter speed, 80 (total)
drops it to eighth speed.  Low level characters could afford 3/4 or
maybe half speed with luck or some sacrifice of speed/dam.  High level
characters could do half pretty easily, maybe a quarter, but would be
very hard pressed to reach eighth speed.  This gives you a limitless
system (so you don't have to make arbitrary rules about how ""the fastest
an action can be is XXX."") but keeps the scale fairly compressed so that
high level characters aren't acting in fractional counts all the time.
You can also just add your speed points up and spend them without
worrying about halving reaction speed (it has been effectively halved by
buying you half as much compared to damage and chance to hit).  It also
is pretty easy to remember:  20, 40, 80 = 1/2, 1/4, 1/8.

What do you think?

PS.  If you have not caught it already, you have the old (old) version
of the speed point formula in the combat section.

I am going to respond to comments soon (I may stay late tonight and do
it) but am buried in work right now.  Good thoughts Geoff- particularly
about Teacher's not having to be as good as the student.  I wonder if
there is a distinction between teaching and coaching on a game level...
Hmmm... DAMN!  Can't think about it now!  

Later!

I agree completley.  Consider it changed. It has changed on the Web site 
already.  I know I am breaking a cardinal rule by updating the docs as I
get input, but I decided a live document would make more sense than a 
dead one.

Noted.  Chariot driving IS a VHF skill, and will be related to
Horsemanship
whether Horsemanship is VHF or AGF.  I still think a
runner/acrobat/dancer
should make a better rider than a pilot/race car driver/cabbie.  Is it a 
really close call.  You bet.  10 GMs would probably split down the
middle
about it.  I, however, still lean towards the AGF camp

Hmmm.. I can get this, but I would be more likely to take SCF out than 
put MCF in.   Skill RANKs give SPD points now so a gunslinger's RANK in 
pistol will speed him or her up a lot.  I am not sure that knowing how
to 
shoot, or cast, automatically gives you speed.  When I gave SCF points I 
was thinking of spell duels and combat situations, but I do not know.
I am clear that PCF, AGF, and VHF all belong where they are.  I am
pretty 
sure I want DXF to be there too (nimble fingers and all:-)) but I don't 
think SCF and MCF really belong there.
I am torn on this one... Comments?

It isn't just that it is easy to accumulate negative intiative.  I don't 
mind that so much.  But I want people to be able to speed up their
actions
because of their skill AND react in positive counts until fairly high 
levels.  The split system manages that very well.

Hmmm.... That isn't too bad.  But it doesn't model that I want higher 
level characters to take time to react and act quickly.

 This gives you a limitless

Ummm... no it still has the same problem.  1 count is still one count.  
Beyond that I have to start fudging.  Just like now.

The way BT is run, speed can be used on ANY action.  In theory, every
level factor could be argued to contribute to speed.  A jazz guitarist,
for example, needs to react quickly to play those spiffy riffs and keep
up with the ever changing improvisation.  In actual play though, when is
speed really important?  When your life is in danger.  In a combat
situation.  That is when speed is really important, and I believe people
who are in lots of combat situations react more quickly because their
lives depend upon developing that ability.  That is why PCF and AGF
should contribute to speed.  High speed chases justify VHF.  And I think
that missile and magical combat is just as deadly, and those who engage
in it should be faster.  If anything, I would drop DXF since speed is
not a critical part of most DXF skills.

My point was that with a linear scale for spending SPD, high level
characters will constantly push the barrier and make you work with
smaller and smaller fractions of a count.  With a geometricallly
increasing scale, characters still have some chance of breaking a new
barrier of speed, but they will effectively ""top out"" at quarter speed,
and only the extremely good or lucky will hit eighth speed.

[Myth]
I think 'combat reflexes', or whatever you want to call them (""pilot 
reflexes"" in the Liaden books) should be a separate issue from speed 
points.

Speed points seem to model the way highly-learned skills make one faster 
to act when doing those skills, and having a bunch of highly-learned 
skills makes one faster overall than someone without them.

This whole combat reflexes issue, OTOH, seems to be implying that people 
who have had to react for their life are consistently faster than those 
who haven't.  To me, this would seem like an Advantage, to be handled 
under the Ad/Disad system.  Call it 'Faster Reaction', have it give one 
SPD per level, and price it prohibitively enough so people only develop 
it after years in the field (when it is cheaper than raising your 
Assault Rifle another level, for instance).

Just a thought.


[Jeff]
Second, I think the splitting of speed into action and reaction is awkward.

[Alex]
It isn't just that it is easy to accumulate negative initiative.  I don't mind 
that so much.  But I want people to be able to speed up their actions because
of
their skill AND react in positive counts until fairly high levels.  The split 
system manages that very well.

[Jeff]
So what can you do with the remaining SPD points from the 1st half?  I 
just dislike the idea of having a stat that you typically use only half 
of.

[Myth]
I think that may be the crux of my disliking the current speed system so 
much.  The current SPD stat was evolved to handle a one-category speed 
system, and functions only moderately well when divided into two (sometimes 
uneven) parts to deal with this action/reaction dichotomy.

Another thought.


                 -Myth, apparently without enough to do at work.

up with the ever changing improvisation.  In actual play though, when is 
speed really important?  When your life is in danger.  In a combat 
situation.  That is when speed is really important, and I believe people 
who are in lots of combat situations react more quickly because their 
lives depend upon developing that ability.  That is why PCF and AGF 
should contribute to speed.  High speed chases justify VHF.  And I think 
that missile and magical combat is just as deadly, and those who engage 
in it should be faster.  If anything, I would drop DXF since speed is 
not a critical part of most DXF skills.

[Myth]
I think 'combat reflexes', or whatever you want to call them (""pilot 
reflexes"" in the Liaden books) should be a separate issue from speed 
points.

Speed points seem to model the way highly-learned skills make one faster 
to act when doing those skills, and having a bunch of highly-learned 
skills makes one faster overall than someone without them.

This whole combat reflexes issue, OTOH, seems to be implying that people 
who have had to react for their life are consistently faster than those 
who haven't.  To me, this would seem like an Advantage, to be handled 
under the Ad/Disad system.  Call it 'Faster Reaction', have it give one 
SPD per level, and price it prohibitively enough so people only develop 
it after years in the field (when it is cheaper than raising your 
Assault Rifle another level, for instance).

Just a thought.

[Pookie]
If you really want to open the whole can of worms I think that speed is impossible to model in a workable game system.  My first instinct is to propose a mental speed and a physical speed but on reflection I realize that the speed in BT is purely mental.  It appears to me that speed is a reflection of crisis decision making ability rather than the speed at which limbs move or even nerves react.  For this reason I think MCF is actually appropriate, AGF may be over rated, PCF is definitely the most important and SCF should contribute for Sorcery style skills and not for Spells and Rituals.  Of course the last of these is a pain to model and so I am happy with the current system recognizing that it is a reasonable approximation. 

[Jeff]
Second, I think the splitting of speed into action and reaction is awkward.

[Alex]
It isn't just that it is easy to accumulate negative initiative.  I don't mind 
that so much.  But I want people to be able to speed up their actions because
of
their skill AND react in positive counts until fairly high levels.  The split 
system manages that very well.

[Jeff]
So what can you do with the remaining SPD points from the 1st half?  I 
just dislike the idea of having a stat that you typically use only half 
of.

[Myth]
I think that may be the crux of my disliking the current speed system so 
much.  The current SPD stat was evolved to handle a one-category speed 
system, and functions only moderately well when divided into two (sometimes 
uneven) parts to deal with this action/reaction dichotomy.

Another thought.

[Pookie]
Just to make sure everyone is on the same page.  I like the current split between reaction and action speeds for the reasons that Alex put forth (allowing characters to have faster action times but still non-zero reactions).  The thing I am confused about is peoples complaint that the reaction portion of speed is wasted.  Both parts of speed have uses:  for reaction speed each point reduces reaction time down to zero and then the remainder can be translated at one-to-one to action speed points.  For action speed some of the points can be used to speed the action (depending on the system being used but always in integral chunks) and the remainder can be applied to to hit bonuses (micro-setup).  Perhaps it is because I am a spreadsheet weeney but I always chart out all of my weapons ahead of time so that no speed points are unused.  It also may be easier for Sigmund since at higher speeds the split becomes irrelevant.  Since extra reaction points flow to actions Sigmund just subtracts his initiative dice from

[Markd]

My understanding and experience parallels Pook's- again, running a fast,
high level character makes the split irrelevant. 

Personally, I think the split isn't all that important- 

1st case- low speed:  Ok, I can get negative, maybe, on a good roll. But
then my action is at normal speeds since I don't have any points left
over to buy it down.

2nd- Medium speed: Can react negative, and still have a little left
over, or can speed up action and be just positive.

3rd- Fassssst: Doesn't matter as Pook and I attest- split is ignored.

So why bother splitting? It slows down slow and mid people, but has no
real effect on fast people. Seems like extra bookkeeping just to slow
down reaction speeds a tick or three.

Pretty much what he said.  They are also usually ""sentient"" in a way in
that they are guided by the will abstraction they were generated from.
[Practical terms: Do what the god they are linked to wants!]  They are
insanely hard to break (Dora broke one with the hammer- it was ugly),
they ignore armor (YES YOU HEARD ME!), and they do permanent damage.

Jim description of their ""special ability"" is accurate.

"BT Rev 6A -SPEED - Please respond!","Okay- there seem to be three related topics:

(1) What should influence SPD

(2) Should SPD be split?

(3) Should SPD be mucked with since it is inherently 
flawed?:-) [Just kidding- okay!  Two topics]

First let us look at SPD in B.T. Revision 6.0 Alpha.  


Discernment and Agility both impact it.  Okay- I can buy that!

Now level factors.  Here is the key- given that the level 
factors are arbitrary game-design given factors, the question 
isn't which level factors in real life contribute to reaction 
speed but rather what highly skilled character types that 
the level factors represent do we wnat to be faster?  

PCF: I want warriors to be faster.  I am clear the high-level 
fighter should have lightning fast reflexes.  Okay PCF is in 
and is a major contributor!

MCF: I don't buy it.  Snipers, archers, gun slingers?  Yes- they 
are fast- but at what they are good at.  There are too many 
people in this class who wouldn't need to be fast at all so it is 
a poor generalization for me.

AGF: Acrobats, gymnasts, runners, cat burglars, climbers.  This one 
is less clear than PCF.  However, I think of these people as fast 
reacting.  They use their muscles a lot, are coordinated and aware 
of their bodies (I am in awe!;-))  Maybe less impact than PCF!  Maybe
/20.

DXF: Jewelers, safe crackers, pick pockets, sleight-of-handers, 
sailors, etc.  Hmmm.. a mixed bag.   I imagine these people at high
level 
being somewhat fast but I guess it is like MCF.  There are fast people
in 
the professions (pick pockets, sleight-of-handers) but most are just
precise. 
Sigh.  .05 would work.  /20?  

VHF: Drivers, racers, pilots... yea they are fast.  I even visualize 
the slow- easy driving chauffer being able to react instantly if need
be.  
This one is up there with PCF.  I am clear this should be a major stat
in SPD.

SCF: Nope.  Shouldn't be.  Many mages are just concentrated plodders.  
Combat mages should take quickstrike skills, and combat reflexes.  :-)

KIF: Puh-leese!

SKF/INF/CTF: NOPE. I was slightly tempted with CTF, but I got over it. 


Okay- but lets look at the current system....

(1) Next the formula:

    (DSC + AGL - 20)/2 + PCF/10 + DXF/10 + AGF/10 + VHF/10 + SCF/20

(2) Let us define some characters (I am ignoring SCF for now...:->)

Joe Loser(sorry Joe): STR:7, DEX:7, AGL:7, DSC:7, PCF:-6, AGF:-6,
DXF:-6, VHF:-6
Lisa Average(sorry Lisa): STR:10, DEX:10, AGL:10, DSC:10, PCF:0, AGF:0,
DXF:0, VHF:0
Lara Cool(Your Welcome): STR:13, DEX:13, AGL:13, DSC:13, PCF:8, AGF:8,
DXF:8, VHF:8
Britt Supreme(Pay Later): STR:17, DEX:17, AGL:17, DSC:17, PCF:17,
AGF:16, DXF:16, VHF:16

(3) The Inititative Rules
        a) SPD_MOD = SPD + {(RANK in skill to be used) - 2} + {(RANK in 
           secondaries to be used) - 2}/2 + QUICKSTRIKE_MOD -
SITUATIONAL_MODS

	b) INIT = 2d6 - SPD_MOD/2

	c) SITUATIONAL MODS = stunned +8; DAZED +4; MISSED LAST SHOT +4; CRIT 
                              MISSED +8; WOUNDED +2/qrtr; ENDURED
+2/qrtr; 
                              SURPRISED +12; FLORENTINE +4; OFF HAND +2
           QUICKSTRIKE = RANK in QUICKSTRIKE * CRIT MODIFIERS(if any)

(4) Let's see the spread (based on 2d6, using a rank 2 skill, with no
quickstrike 
skill or secondaries, and no situational modifiers.)

Joe Loser: SPD-> -3 -2.4 -> -5.4 / 2 -> -2.7  
  QUICKEST REACTION: 4.4 counts = .8 seconds / loses 2.7 counts of
Action spd
  AVERAGE REACTION: 9.7 counts = 2 seconds / loses 2.7 counts of Action
spd
  SLOWEST REACTION: 14.7 cts = 2.9 seconds / loses 2.7 cts of action spd

Lisa Average: SPD -> 0
  QUICKEST REACTION: 2 counts = .4 seconds / loses no counts of Action
spd
  AVERAGE REACTION: 7 counts = 1.2 seconds / loses no counts of Action
spd
  SLOWEST REACTION: 12 cts = 2.4 seconds / loses no cts of Action spd

Lara Cool: SPD -> 3 + 3.2 -> 6.2 / 2 -> 3.1  [This, by the way, is an
ordinary 
                                             START character)
  QUICKEST REACTION: 0 counts = 0 seconds / gains 4.2 spd pts
  AVERAGE REACTION: 3.9 counts = .8 seconds / gains 3.1 spd pts
  SLOWEST REACTION: 8.9 cts = 1.7 seconds / gains 3.1 spd pts

Britt Supreme: SPD -> 7 + 6.4 -> 13.4 / 2 -> 6.7

  QUICKEST REACTION: 0 counts = 0 seconds / gains 11.4 spd pts
  AVERAGE REACTION: 0.3 counts = .06 seconds / gains 6.7 spd pts
  SLOWEST REACTION: 5.3 cts = 1.06 seconds / gains 6.7 spd pts

Interesting isn't it?  Remember most PCs have at least one skill they
are good 
at so say they have one 5.0 starting out.  Add 1.5 to all their
initiatives and 
1.5 spd points.  That means Britt Supreme is a 0 reaction on average! 

Likewise look at what every 10 level factor points do in the appropriate
skills!   
THat is a -0.1 to their init for every 2 level factor jumps.  People
with 50 PCFs 
will have 2.5 lower INIT and 2.5 more SPD points.  Check that out... Say
using a 
RANK 7 weapon(3.5 ADJUSTED SPD)... say with 1 ADJ SPD pts worth of
secondaries.
That is 7 more ADJ SPD pts.  So...
Joe Loser: 0/2.7/7.7
Lisa Average: 0/0/5
Lara Cool: 0/0/1.9
Britt Supreme:0/0/0

If we used the old SPD Joe Loser with the above mentioned skills would
react 
instantly on his worst roll- never mind Lara Cool.

These numbers I think show why I want the split.  It keeps Lara Cool
with a 
50 PCF, RANK 7 skill, still on her toes. She still COULD react in
positive 
counts which would be impossible otherwise.  

Unless someone can show me something else I want to go with this method.
I 
have become enrolled though in a new formula:

    (DSC + AGL - 20)/2 + PCF/10 + VHF/10 + AGF/20

Also what do people think of and ACTION SPD and REACTION SPD? Would that
be 
easier if it was designed as two stats?  Then negative init would add to
your 
ACTION SPEED MOD?  Something like this:

ACT SPD = (AGL - 10)/2 + PCF/20 + VHF/20 + AGF/40 + SPD_MOD +
NEGATIVE_INIT_MOD
RCT SPD = (DSC - 10)/2 + PCF/20 + VHF/20 + AGF/40 + SPD_MOD
SPD_MOD = [{(RANK in skill to be used) - 2} + {(RANK in 
           secondaries to be used) - 2}/2 + QUICKSTRIKE_MOD -
SITUATIONAL_MODS]/2
INIT = 2d6 - RCT SPD

ACT SPD would generate spd pts to speed up actions.  If you generated
negative 
init with your RCT SPD they would become spd pts ( the above
NEGATIVE_INIT_MOD 
refers to this).  

Thoughts?

For what it is worth, I agree with your relative ratings of PCF, VHF and
AGF, and most of your arguments about the other level factors.  However,
in play, speed is USED by people in all classes.  It is critical to
shooters in a gunfight and mages in a mage duel, even though magic
doesn't even have a physical aspect to it!  What does it matter to a
mage's reaction time if he can punch people quickly?  Since you USE
speed for the complete spectrum of skills, and since it can be critical
(as in life or death) for people using a wide range of skills, I think a
wide range of level factors should contribute (although maybe even at
lesser percentages than AGF).

I also think you are very biased toward PHYSICAL speed and toward
martial arts (just because you like them so much).  Although most of the
actions that require tracking counts and speed points are physical and
combat related, it is a mistake to assume they are the only ones
important enough to model.  You realize that except for DSC, there is
absolutely no representation of mental speed, yet half of your level
factors are based on speed.  Try telling Borealis that speed is not
important when he is trying to jam a comm signal or deactivate a bomb. 
Try telling Mordanith that speed is not important to him because it is
only based on physical actions.  In case I have not been clear :-) I
think there is a big difference in your personal concept of what speed
is compared to the way you apply it in actual gaming.

I am also very much against having an action and reaction speed.  As I
said earlier, accumulated system changes and higher level characters
have made it obvious that speed points are too easy to get.  Rather than
create two types of speed, or split the old number in half and use two
sets of rules for each half, why not just divide the whole formula by 2
and use the points as is?  That way you do one calculation when you make
your spreadsheet and/or manually update your character rather than using
a fractional stat in play.

OK, enough ranting...

Joe called as I was finishing this e-mail and we discussed this whole
issue.  Of course, he agrees with me completely ;-)  And actually, we
generated some food for thought.

Considering all the above arguments, the most realistic thing to do
within BT might be to go to level factor based speeds.  Your speed would
be, say level factor over 10 or level factor over 5.  Forget about base
speed because each action would use the level factor speed most
appropriate.  Then you would add your rank in your skill.  If you want
to reflect crossover (martial artists quicker at shooting guns, etc.)
you could have a physical base speed and a mental base speed.  You would
then add, say physical or mental base speed, level factor over 10, and
rank-2 to get total speed points for each action.  And as MY personal
bias, I would still throw DSC into physical speed to reflect the need to
figure out what the hell is going on before you can react.

There.  Hopefully you are now unenrolled.  Your refund is in the mail
;-)

"Re: BT Rev 6A -SPEED - Please respond!","This is a summary of a discussion between Alex, Joe and me about speed,
and some more food for thought (as if you weren't full already ;-)

After much discussion, I believe the three of us agreed:
1) Trying to model speed sucks.  It is very hard to base it on any hard
data from real life, so the best option is to go for what ""feels right""
and works well from a game balance point of view.
2) People generally first go through a reaction phase, in which they
figure out what is going on.  People are more likely to figure this out
quickly and more accurately if they have a high discernment and/or if
they are familiar with the type of situation they are in.
3) People then choose a response and execute it.  Certainly expertise in
the skill and similar skills helps them act more quickly.  Possibly
other factors help to lesser degrees.
4) Physical skills probably should not greatly affect speed of mental
actions and vice versa.
5) I think we even all agreed that the current BT system unfairly
emphasizes only physical skill even though it is to all skills, physical
and mental.

Here is a proposal for a new method of calculating speed points.  This
is not meant to be the perfect system, but should be a good starting
point for discussion:

At the risk of making things too simple for Alex ;-) I would propose not
making the distinction between reaction and action, but including
elements of both in one pool of speed point as the current system does.

Speed points would be: STM/2 + LVL FACTOR/4 + SKILL-2 + SECONDARIES, ETC

Or to include DSC:  (STM + DSC)/4 + LVL FACTOR/4 + SKILL-2 + 2NDRY, ETC

Using STM reflects the idea (particularly Joe's) that all skills help a
person to see patterns more quickly and understand situations more
clearly.  It also crosses the division between mental and physical
skills, allowing both to contribute.  DSC if included reflects the
persons natural ability to see and understand patterns.  If there were
to be a separate reaction phase, STM and DSC would probably be heavily
involved (although they are just added into the pool in this system). 
The skill and secondaries are as in the current system, for all the same
reasons.

The other big change outside of STM is using a level factor.  It would
be whichever level factor is most appropriate to the situation.  If you
are sparring it is PCF, if you are in a mage duel it is SCF.  It would
be the level factor of whatever skill you chose to use for your upcoming
action.

Here is another twist that would simplify things (but probably too much
for the level of detail in BT):  Instead of LEVEL FACTOR/4, use LEVEL
FACTOR/2, but no longer let secondaries and tertiaries contribute to
speed or damage.  Use LVL FACTOR/2 for both.  This would cut down on the
number of calculations of fractional speed and damage points that need
to be done in play (but does not reflect the fact that some skills
within a level factor may have better secondaries than others).  Just a
thought.

A quick mental exercise made it look like any of these proposed formulae
would keep average speed points in the same ballpark as they are now,
but they would be considerably higher for specialists in their level
factor of expertise, and maybe notably lower for people in areas in
which they have no skill.  I would be interested to know how anybody
else's characters would come out with this system, particularly lower
level characters.

SPD = (DSC - 14)/2 + STM/2 + LVF/10 

SPD_MODS = RANK_MODS - SITUATIONAL_MODS + QUICKSTRIKE_MODS

     RANK_MODS = (PRIMARY -2) + (GENERAL - 2)/2* +  (SECONDARY1 - 2)/2*
                 + (SECONDARY2 - 2)/2*
          * Can never be less than 0.
     SITUATIONAL MODS = stunned +8; DAZED +4; MISSED LAST SHOT +4; CRIT 
                        MISSED +8; WOUNDED +2/qrtr; ENDURED+2/qrtr; 
                        SURPRISED +12; FLORENTINE +4; OFF HAND +2
     QUICKSTRIKE = RANK in QUICKSTRIKE * CRIT MODIFIERS(if any)

What do people think?

____

INITIATIVE

INIT = 2d6 - (SPD + SPD_MODS)/2

I heard what people said about action/reaction.  However it is a
significant cut in realism to go to a single number reaction.  You will
have medium level people reacting instantly and then taking as long as 
a rank beginner to perform the action.  The split creates skilled people
both acting and reacting faster.   As the numbers in my original post
show this is significant in a lot of the range that PCs enter into.

Some people are so high level they USUALLY don't have to worry about the
split- unless they are wounded, etc.  It provides a game-play worthy
event in that it causes people to have positive reactions at medium
levels AND it has peons be even slower for those of you that engage in
multi-opponent fights.  

SPEED POINT GENERATION for QUICKER ACTION:  (SPD + SPD_MODS)/2.  You 
can also gain one SPD point per: 
	negative initiative point
	10% to-hit
	2 points of damage
	
Speeding up actions is ten points to half, twenty more points to a
quarter, twenty more points to an eighth, etc.  When the division 
in half means cutting an odd number, one always rounds up but only 
pays 80% of cost(8 instead of 10, 16 instead of twenty).

One can make partial spd adjustments by evenly distributing the 
twenty(16) or ten(8) between the range of counts in each category. 
I.e.:

(these are some possible spreads just off-the-cuff examples)
BAstard Sword -WSD = 14 cts	FIST - WSD=4 cts   SORCERY - WSD=10 cts
WSD     #SPD POINTS             WSD     #SPD PTS   WSD     #SPD PTS

9       7                       KICK - WSD=8 cts   5       10
8       9                       8       0          4       18
7       10 - 10 to half -       7       2          3       26
6       15                      6       5          2       42
5       20                      5       7          1       62
4       26 - 16 more to 1/4 -   4       10
3       36                      3       20
2       46 - 20 more to 1/8-    2       30
1       66 - 20 more to 1/16 -  1       50

Thoughts?

Look at the math and you will seewhy I like the split I think - it 
means a mage will react 20% quicker AND cast 20% quicker which is 
much more realistic.  ANd it creates the combat effects I want- longer
fights, higher level people acting more quickly, more of a realistic
feel.  AND it isn't that hard just to divid ethe damn number in half!;-)

That was too short and abrupt - what the heck are you talking about?

Let me use Mordanith.  I am going to make up your ranks but they will 
be ball park I think...

SCF: 193  PCF: 25  STM 27  DSC 19  AGL: 17?  DEX: 15?  AGF: 15?DXF: 3?
Abjuration: 10;  Spell casting: 9 Secondary: 8; Secondary: 8

THE NEW formula:(DSC-14)/2 + STM/2 +SCF/10
THE OLD formula:(DSC +AGL -20)/2 +PCF/10 +AGF/10 + DXF/10 +VHF/10+SCF/20

RANK modifiers are: (RANK -2) + (SECONDARY1-2)/2 + (SECONDARY2 -2)/2 + 
                    (GENERAL - 2)/2.

In the new system: 35 base + 17 rank ->52 speed - 26 applied to INIT
In the old system: 21.6 base + 17 rank->38 spd - 19 applied to INIT

And the difference is only 7 SPD points to INIT.  I could have some of
your factors or stats wrong but it won't make that much difference.  I
don't understand your point.   We must be calculating current speed
differently!  You ARE an extreme!  It would take a character YEARS to
get to your level, and they would have to have your XPM.  You are THE
example of the top end... and you can still react in positive time if
double stunned, missed your last attack, and you roll bad!:-) 

I am assuming i missed something-  please elaborate!   NOTICE though-
your speed goes up in your specialty but CRASHES when outside of it.
Observe you in a sword fight:
Sword: 7  Secondary1: 5  Secondary2: 5 General: 0
 SPD= 2.5 + 13.5 + 2.5 -> 18.5 -> 18 
 RNK= 5 + 3 + 3 ->11
TOTAL SPD-> 18 + 11 -> 29 - 14.5 applied to init.

"Re: BTR6A - SPEED The response","(DSC-10)/2 + STM/2 + LVL/10 + SKL MODS looks like it would work pretty
well.  I think peoples' speeds will generally decrease in all but their
main areas, but maybe that is not a bad thing.  I take it that DSC-14
was a typo.  Do tertiaries still add (SKL-2)/4?

I yield on the splitting speed in half argument.  I did not understand
the mechanism, and it is much simpler than I thought.  The system as I
understand it now seems pretty good.

More questions...
The total costs to speed up actions are now 10 (=1/2 speed), 30 (=1/4
speed), 50 (=1/8 speed), 70 (=1/16 speed)?  Is that right?

Is there a penalty for dropping below one count?  I do not believe there
should be (especially if, as you said, you do not have a problem with
actions that take less than a count existing in your system).  It is
arbitrary, and will make short actions harder to speed up
(proportionally) than long actions, given the new system.

I am glad you decided not to add other skills as secondaries to defense
(although Stephen is bumming!).  I like the fact that nothing else is as
important as the Defense skill, with one possible exception.  I would
suggest some number of tertiaries, plus Combat Perception as an
extra--above and beyond the number of tertiaries--because of its
importance.  Or let Combat Perception add 3% per rank like the Defense
skill.  You cannot defend against what you cannot see coming, and the
better you see it, the better you can defend.  In a sense it is as
important as the Defense skill.  Since Combat Perception does not need
to be rolled to use active defense, it should weigh heavily into the
base defense stat.

I would also suggest adding skill in the opponent's attack form as an
additional bonus since it is a situational modifier that will change
from one combat to the next.  This may have been your intention, but I
was not sure from the write-up.

In addition, all of my speed calculations have always truncated before
addition, just like the Level Factor calculations

so in the example above I have a 8+2+1+0+0+9 = 20 speed. When added to
the rank mods of 7+3+3=13 gave me a speed of 33 versus the new system of
2+13+19 = 36 base speed plus rank mods of 13 gives me 49. Either way
there is an increase of 50% in the total speed points (reaction and
action ) available to a character.

As I said above - low STM people actually drop in SPD in this new model.
It is a change I admit.  


[Jim Jackl-Mochel]  Crash, hardly. Yes, it goes lower but without any
_real_ difference. My reaction speed is still negative on all
(no-stunned , no miss) rolls. What is more a character reaches this
point in their specialty much sooner because they have a LVL Factor and
the STM boosting them into that range.

All of my objections are based on the fact that it changes the scale

Maybe that was true.  No longer.  I am actively trying to simplify as
well as make more ""realistic"".  

Combat Perception should be a tertiary for Defense.  Without question.
See Jeff's comments and my reply belwoabout that.

Thanks.  Here is the scoop- in the ""BASIC"" rules secondaries and
teritaries do not add to SPD and DAM.  In the ""ADVANCED"" rules
secondaries add SPD and DAM, but tertiaries don't.  In the ""DESIGN""
rules tertiaries do add (RANK - 2)/4 to SPD and DAM.  I am writing the
user's guide for the ""ADVANCED"" rules.  This is what is most commuonly
played.  I will ""publish"" an addendum that has the DESIGN
modifications.  
Basically what i am cutting out of ADVANCED to put in DESIGN are the
things I think SHOULD be there but are edging over into too much
math/complexity in play time.

Okay.... 
1) See above about tertiaries.  I am, in general, going to run the
Advanced rule set so NO, teriraies do not add tertiaries for RNK and 
SPD.

2) DISC - 14 was NOT  a typo.  It was an across the board linear SPD
drop by two points.  The PROs: It gives people a little more realistic
speeds .  It generates closer to the range ofd numbers I am looking
for.  
The CONs: While it works great with PCs and mid -range characters, and
really doesn't have much effect on high-level characters, it bumms out
low-level peasant types who aren't using a skill they have 2.0 in or
higher.  Basically if they have 10s in their stats, no secondaries,  
and their primary skill is less than 3- they will be dirt slow.  
They will react- on average- in 9 counts (wince). However- everything
else about it is positive so I think it shouldn't be a problem.

Geoff continued with:

Yeah!  I am glad.  For a few brief moments I thought I was going to be
talked out of the split.

That is correct.

I didn't think it was a problem that short actions were harder to 
speed up.  As a matter of fact that was one of the intientions of 
the new system.  

But, nonetheless, I agree.  No penealties for going faster than a 
count.  Once you are at a count it will only cost you 20 more spd 
points to cut it to half/count.

I tend to agree.  But what do people think?  Should I add Combat 
Perception as a secondary to Defense.   It makes sense to me.  What
about COmbat Perception as a secondary and two tertiaries.  Or three?
People?

It wasn't -but now that you say that - we could just keep the system
consistant.  <RANK in opponent's attack form> and Combat perception can
be used as secondaries and two tertiaries can be used from the approved
list.  Does that make sense?  Who agreees?  (Okay all the smart people
obviously)  Who disagrees? (the smarter people...;-))

Let me know.

Is the only argument that it takes too much time? Chuck has been running
at the Design level for most of his career, and I don't think it slows
me down any. Are there problems with mixing level of play?? I'd like to

Either way- it should be at least a Tert. That would make it sort of fit
the formula- just that the only allowed Secs are CP and Def. We are
talking just about the Def STAT here, right? There aren't any plans to
change how the Def SKILL is run, right?

I like the idea, but I'm not sure what level of the rules it belongs at.
Seems like it could really slow things down, as well as make for some
causality problems. Gets messy with feints and stuff too. I'd probably
kick it up to Design, and it needs a lot of work.

Tertiaries are gone from SPD and DAMage in the BASIC and ADVANCED rules
but still there in the DESIGN level rules (the place where all the rules
I Think should exist live)  You might prefer running under the Advanced
rules because they will be a lot more playable than the DESIGN level 
ones.

Your STM must be higher than that!  Your PCF is around 60 isn't it?  So 
that alone gives you 6 STM.  Formula for stm:

Add ALL Level Factors together.  Divide by 10. Voila!  And remember- all
your LVFs will go up because of the new stat addition to level factor.

Not at all!  We can run at a mixed level- you just have to let me 
know which one you are running at.  If you choose DESIGN I will 
expect you tpo run by the rules.  If you run at ADVANCED- don't 
complain if someone finesses some points and you don't get them. All
of you competitive weenies think about that- you may want to run at 
DESIGN.  ALl of you who just want to role-play and wish we would just
finish talking about the rules want to choose ADVANCED or maybe even
BASIC.  BASIC is the stripped down version of the rules, quick and 
dirty.   I, being one of those weenies who would want to run at DESIGN, 
do not understand, but I am making the BASIC level available. :-)

Okay... I do need a working plan:  Here goes->
BASIC RULES: 
The DEF stat is as it is plus DEF as a secondary.
ADVANCED RULES:
The DEF stat takes DEFENSE and C.PER. as secondaries.  People can choose
two(2) of the selected other skillsto use as tertiaries- one of which is
<opponenent's other weapon if the player chooses.
DESIGN RULES:
The DEF stat takes Appropriate Perception, and DEFENSE.  One can choose
two tertiaries from the selected list including knowledge of opponents 
weapon.  Appropriate Perception could be MCF if under archer- or
gun-fire, SCF if matter blasts, pyromantic attacks, etc., PCF if in 
combat...

What do you think? Is relatively simple no?  :-)  I don't mind it-
I did some quick number crunching just now:
Appropriate Perception, Defense, Opponent's weapon skill at RNK 10 
gives +0 in BASIC rules, +70 in ADVANCED and DESIGN rules. 
ADD + RNK for one more tertiary to ADVANCED AND DESIGN
 
Simple Simon: AGL: 10, BLD: 10, PCF: 4, AGF: 4  DEF-> 0.8
Just John: AGL: 14, BLD: 12, PCF: 50, AGF: 25   DEF-> 39
Handy Harry: AGL: 18, BLD: 10, PCF: 100, AGF:100, DEF->58
Outrageous Oliver: AGL: 20, BLD:5, PCF:200, AGF: 100 DEF->90

Ok at Basic- I'm still not sure about opponents weapon type- this will
get really messy. Say you react to a feinted thrust from my rapier, and
do an active defense. During the count or two that it takes, I reveal my
true attack which is a slug from my weighted cloak (with which you have
no familiarity). What a GMing nightmare!!! Theoretically, if you are
defending against the wrong weapon, it should REDUCE the efectiveness,
maybe even give a plus?? I don't know- it seems like a real can of
worms. Where do you draw the line? How much of a plus is my HAND vs an
ELBOW? 4/5s? HAND vs a GRAB? Long sword vs Short sword? Bleagh! 

I agree that it should go in there- I'm just not sure it is that easy to
model.

In addition, all of my speed calculations have always truncated before

so in the example above I have a 8+2+1+0+0+9 = 20 speed. When added to
the rank mods of 7+3+3=13 gave me a speed of 33 versus the new system of
2+13+19 = 36 base speed plus rank mods of 13 gives me 49. Either way
there is an increase of 50% in the total speed points (reaction and
action ) available to a character.

get a little faster, medium STM stay about the same and low STM get a

As I said above - low STM people actually drop in SPD in this new model.
It is a change I admit.  


[Jim Jackl-Mochel]  Crash, hardly. Yes, it goes lower but without any
_real_ difference. My reaction speed is still negative on all
(no-stunned , no miss) rolls. What is more a character reaches this

the STM boosting them into that range.

All of my objections are based on the fact that it changes the scale
significantly. And on the statistical level it definitely does. This

Maybe that was true.  No longer.  I am actively trying to simplify as
well as make more ""realistic"".  

Combat Perception should be a tertiary for Defense.  Without question.
See Jeff's comments and my reply belwoabout that.

Thanks.  Here is the scoop- in the ""BASIC"" rules secondaries and
teritaries do not add to SPD and DAM.  In the ""ADVANCED"" rules
secondaries add SPD and DAM, but tertiaries don't.  In the ""DESIGN""
rules tertiaries do add (RANK - 2)/4 to SPD and DAM.  I am writing the
user's guide for the ""ADVANCED"" rules.  This is what is most commuonly
played.  I will ""publish"" an addendum that has the DESIGN
modifications.  
Basically what i am cutting out of ADVANCED to put in DESIGN are the
things I think SHOULD be there but are edging over into too much
math/complexity in play time.  

Geoff said:

Okay.... 
1) See above about tertiaries.  I am, in general, going to run the
Advanced rule set so NO, teriraies do not add tertiaries for RNK and 
SPD.

2) DISC - 14 was NOT  a typo.  It was an across the board linear SPD
drop by two points.  The PROs: It gives people a little more realistic
speeds .  It generates closer to the range ofd numbers I am looking
for.  
The CONs: While it works great with PCs and mid -range characters, and
really doesn't have much effect on high-level characters, it bumms out
low-level peasant types who aren't using a skill they have 2.0 in or
higher.  Basically if they have 10s in their stats, no secondaries,  
and their primary skill is less than 3- they will be dirt slow.  
They will react- on average- in 9 counts (wince). However- everything
else about it is positive so I think it shouldn't be a problem.

Geoff continued with:
>I yield on the splitting speed in half argument.  I did not understand
>the mechanism, and it is much simpler than I thought.  The system as I
>understand it now seems pretty good.

Yeah!  I am glad.  For a few brief moments I thought I was going to be
talked out of the split.

>More questions...
>The total costs to speed up actions are now 10 (=1/2 speed), 30 (=1/4
>speed), 50 (=1/8 speed), 70 (=1/16 speed)?  Is that right?

That is correct.

I didn't think it was a problem that short actions were harder to 
speed up.  As a matter of fact that was one of the intientions of 
the new system.  

But, nonetheless, I agree.  No penealties for going faster than a 
count.  Once you are at a count it will only cost you 20 more spd 
points to cut it to half/count.

I tend to agree.  But what do people think?  Should I add Combat 
Perception as a secondary to Defense.   It makes sense to me.  What
about COmbat Perception as a secondary and two tertiaries.  Or three?
People?

It wasn't -but now that you say that - we could just keep the system
consistant.  <RANK in opponent's attack form> and Combat perception can
be used as secondaries and two tertiaries can be used from the approved
list.  Does that make sense?  Who agreees?  (Okay all the smart people
obviously)  Who disagrees? (the smarter people...;-))

Let me know.

Is the only argument that it takes too much time? Chuck has been running
at the Design level for most of his career, and I don't think it slows
me down any. Are there problems with mixing level of play?? I'd like to

Either way- it should be at least a Tert. That would make it sort of fit
the formula- just that the only allowed Secs are CP and Def. We are
talking just about the Def STAT here, right? There aren't any plans to
change how the Def SKILL is run, right?

I like the idea, but I'm not sure what level of the rules it belongs at.
Seems like it could really slow things down, as well as make for some
causality problems. Gets messy with feints and stuff too. I'd probably
kick it up to Design, and it needs a lot of work.

Tertiaries are gone from SPD and DAMage in the BASIC and ADVANCED rules
but still there in the DESIGN level rules (the place where all the rules
I Think should exist live)  You might prefer running under the Advanced
rules because they will be a lot more playable than the DESIGN level 
ones.

Your STM must be higher than that!  Your PCF is around 60 isn't it?  So 
that alone gives you 6 STM.  Formula for stm:

Add ALL Level Factors together.  Divide by 10. Voila!  And remember- all
your LVFs will go up because of the new stat addition to level factor.  
Stats now add (STAT - 10)/2 to each level factor!  Your high stats will
serve you well in that!  Here is a list of how that will add on to your
level factors base don stat:
STAT	NOW	NEW	DIFFERENTIAL
3	-4	-14	-10

Absolutley!  But i think feints with alternate weapons happen
infrequently
enough that it will be worth it- and it is an added incentiuve to do
that 
kind of feint.  In real life the drill into martial artists that people
will tend to focus on the weapon you are using and you can use that
against them,
and they coach martial artists not to focus on the wepaon because that
can 
happen.  MOre complicated feints?  YEP!  But in general you are fighting
an opponent who is going to use a consistant weapon.  That is 90% of
fights.
And the method isn't that hard- let's say you were assuming your
opponent was 
using a long sword  and they attack with  a front snap kick.  You were
getting
minus 21% for your rank 7 in long sword - if the feint is successful I
think you should get a +21%.  NOw, is their bleedover?  Probably.  Is a
kick like a punch? Probably!  But It is too detailed to model playably.

I actually know a technique that is an elbow strike off a feint of a
punch.  
You make them think you are punching, let it be blocked, and as the
block 
pushes your forearm aside you rotate your elbow in and do a crane-strike
with 
the elbow.   The answer- if it is a differnet skill you can feint for
full 
value (in BT:-))

As a suggestion- how about putting an = in front of the equations? That
way the entire equation can be yanked into a spreadsheet without needing

Yes.  STM is the (sum of all level factors)/10.

That should be in there!  Absolutley.  If STM is higher than the
italicized level factor then you can replace the level factor with 
STM.

I fixed it.  I know it is bad documentation form in one model, but i am
keeping the on-line docs current with the changes as we make/discuss
them.  That way if someone pops ove rto the site to check on something 
they have the most current stuff.

I don't completely follow you- where would I put the ""=""?  I would

But in the other direction, set-up is 2%, and no direct damage
conversion? This strikes me as one of the only places in the system
where the two sides of the equation are not balanced- I can see that
there are game balance issues, but that may point out some deeper flaw?

Setup is 3% per count in Revsion 6.  I suppose you could do damage
conversion... hmmm.. one point per count?  2 points?  Nahh.. too much!

Don't have time to crunch the numbers now but it could very well 
point out some deeper flaw (namely the creator-muhuhuhuhuha!) but
it may just be a function of the fact that speed points and counts are
not the same.  It just happens that negative initiative will give spd
points... at an apparent(sic?) one-to-one ratio. :-)  Ahhh.. typing 
too fast thinking too slow!:-)

Ummm...understood.  This problem comes from two design paths.  Set up
was designed as a way that people could add to their to-hit by ""setting
up"" their attack.  This became 2% per count(in Rev5, 3% in Rev 6).
Then when we needed to figure out how much spd points give to hit, we
said, well- it can't be more than a real counts worth of difference.
Therefore SPD PTS = set-up bonus.

Let's look at worst case- Mordanith doing an Abjurational spell. 
His STM is 35.  His SCF is 193.  His G:Abjuration is 13.  He has
secondaries of at least RANK 8 to the spell, and has RANK 10 in the 
16 count Power Blast sorcery(an Abjurational sorcery).  His DSC is 17.
Therefore...

FSC= 187 + 193 = 380%
His base speed is 1.5 + 17.5 + 19.3 -> 38.3
His RANK_MODS are 8 + 5.5 + 4 + 4 -> 21.5
Total SPD = 59.8-> call it 60! 

He rolls average(7).  Therefore, he reacts in zero and has 53 SPD
points.  He could, in a one to one conversion:

Using all of them in each category:
DO + 106 points of damage.  Okay I can live with that!
Have + 530% to hit. Yiiiikes!
Do the blast in two counts, and be at +20 DAM or +100% to-hit

Okay... breathe, Alex.  Breathe.  Now- this is an extreme case I 
expect to have maybe one or two others like a Mordanith ever run in
Bardic Tales.   So he is an extreme!

Now, what if it were 5% per spd point.  Would that make spd points 
to easy to buy?   -50 to-hit would buy you half speed.  -150 to-hit
would buy you quarter speed.  

God- that's not so bad is it?  Help!  I am being seduced by the dark
side!:-)

We could have a ""5% to-hit = 1 SPD point = 2 DAM = 1 negative init"" 
sort of deal.   

Okay- maybe I am too harsh...  What do you think? Anyone?

This is the kind of thing I was aiming for- not sure if anything else
needs to change in respect to it- here is Chuck:

SPD (PCF):19
Hand bonus w/ secondaries and Ters:18
Total- 37
Avg roll 7
Leaves 30
4 count action- 
Leave at 4 counts, +150% or  +60 damage.
Cut in half - 2 counts, +100% or +40.
Cut to 1 count- nothing left over.

Seems gross, but maybe not. Chuck has 19 STM, and a 68 PCF. What do you
think?

Hmmm- clearly there needs to be a limit in purchasing dam and to-hit.
Tjhis would be true even if we don't change the system.  +60 DAM on a 
punch is way too much.

Something like you can't buy more than your:
base damage(DAM + WDB + RANK_MODS) [assuming maximum dice of damage]
or 
base success chance (RANK*10 + LVF + THB + RANK_MODS)
with spd points.

"Re[2]: BTR6A - SPEED Buying Speed Points","Okay, so Mordenith is obscenely fast. We knew that.  Unfortunately, I 
didn't bring E-man to work today, so I can't throw out more rational 
mage-numbers to you.  (Alex, if you have the file copy with you, feel free 
to use it.)
     

Chuck, on the other hand, looks just scenely fast.  1-count punches at no 
mods do not seem out of line.

     
My major concern in all of this is that setup speed percentages be roughly 
equivalent to negative-initiative percentages.  If you can react at -10 and 
have a greater chance than someone (of equal skill, naturally) who spent

It was not a typo.  It was my intention with the ""-14"" off of
discernemnt to compensate slightly for the other formula changes AND
to provide a general across the board lowering of the SPD number by 
at least one, and for most people two.  I failed.  Only very low 
level characters were effected as I predicted because I failed to take
into account the jump in STM because of the new stat adjustment to STM.
Therefore I am compensating for that with a /3 on the STM.  I am not
wedded to this- show me why it doesn't work (a one or two point drop in
your speed is expected- it will take more than whining about that to get
me to change my mind:-);-);-)

Damage? Absolutely!  Set-up?  Hmmm... In order to keep it balanced I
owuld have to change the max set-up to 10 + KIF/2 counts instead of 
20 + KIF counts.  That makes sense though to keep the system consistent.
I hate that max set-up for most will be 14 cts = 2.8 seconds.  *SIGH*
Admittedly not that much different from 5.6 seconds.  But... WHat do you
guys think?  Go with 5% per count?

"Re[2]: BTR6A - QUICK E-MAN"," Well, E-Man finally made it to work (Sorry, Lisa), and I have the first 
 numbers.
 
 
 STM 9.8 -> 16.5  
 
 Very nice, but not too surprising given the larger LVF numbers and the 
 smaller divisor.  I expect to see fallout from this all over my 
 spreadsheet this weekend.  (Though I'll be careful not to gloat about my 
 new SCF near Mordenith.)
 
 
 SPD 7 -> 12 -> 10 -> 7.5
 
 Well, it was a fun ride, anyhow.  Actually, I'll be making out quite well 
 with SCF skills.  The save here is mostly due to E-man's high Discernment.
 
 
 MAB 15 -> 15
 
 The higher level factors cancel out the harsher (to E-Man, anyway) 
 formula.
 
 
 DEF 28 -> 15
 
 Sad, but not critically so.  E-Man has never really been a combat 
 character, and should be able to survive the loss.  (Besides, it's a fair 
 trade for that higher SCF.)
 
 
 Sample Action:
 
 Ladiees and Gentlemen!  For your amusement and edification, Erithmaeon the 
 Weaver will now cast an Air Shield!  <wild applause>
 
 This is normally a 10-count sorcery at 118%.  
 Not using his focus gets E-Man a penalty of -10%.
 
 
 Basic Speed - 7.5
 SCF Mods -    5.45  (Hm.  Better raise that SCF.)
 Skill Mods -  2     (Rank 4 in Air Shield)
 G: Mods -     1.5   (Rank 5 in S:Air)
 Secondary -   2.5   (Rank 7 in W:Air)
 Secondary -   1.0   (Rank 4 in Summon Air)
              -----
 Total Speed   19.95  
 
 We divide this into action (10) and reaction (9).
 
 
 Roll 2d6 for initiative.  This is reaction time.  Get the typical '7'.  
 Buying this down to zero leaves me with 2 reaction speed points.  I put 
 them into instant set-up, gaining a few extra percent in the skill. (+6%)
 
 The action takes 10 counts.  For 10 action speed points, I can buy this 
 down to 5 counts.  The next level of reduction (3 counts) is 16 points, or 
 8 points per count.  
 
 A) At -10% per speed point, I stop here.  Further reduction is not worth a 
 -80%.
 
 B) At -5% per speed count I look into further reduction.  -40% is livable, 
 at my skill levels, particularly if I invoke my focus.
 
 
 A) 118% + 6% - 10% = 114% in five counts.
 
 B) 118% + 6% + 10% (decide to use focus) - 40% = 94% in four counts.
 
 
 Option A seems fine.  E-Man can pretty consistantly do half-speed 
 castings, but is unlikely to reduce things much further.  I am comfortable 
 with that at his level.
 
 Option B makes him a little faster, a little more daring, and a little 
 more inclined to play up the mods.
 
 
 
 All comments are welcome, especially ones complaining that E-Man is too 
 gross and warps the system just by being there.

Gacks- I did totally underestimate the effect of the new stat

The only thing I didn't like about it is that it demonstrated to me that
E-man is too gross and warps the system just by being there.

I like the STM/3 change.  When you reduced the effect of level factor to
LVF/10 I was afraid that the system would favor high level characters
too much over lower level specialists.  The STM/3 change addresses this.

I do not like the DSC-14 change/idea/typo.  In BT, the effect of
formulas in play has been more important than using similar mechanisms
throughout the system.  But there is one example where there is a
concept which has been applied consistently and in several areas--the
idea of the average stat being 10.  Many stat based formulas give a
bonus for being above average and a penalty for being below average. 
Since the difference between (DSC-14)/2 and (DSC-10)/2 is only 2 speed
points, I do not think it is worth sacrificing the average stat concept.
If 2 points makes a critical difference to the speed system, then it has
bigger problems than DSC.

.. and HTK?  100% of the characters I know of (Stephen and Chuck) had
their HTK drop.  Is this generallly true?  The old HTK to damage ratio
seemed to work OK--do you want HTK to drop in general?  If you need to
increase HTK a bit, you could drop the /2 from (DRV-10).  That would
also have the nice side effect for (math neatnicks like me) of getting
rid of half-HTK points.

Well, with a Build of 9 (having re-found the Build discussion in my 
archives), E-Man retains his HTK of 32.  Further numbers as they develop.

While I liked the speed formula a lot last week, I spent a bunch of time
stewing over it this weekend, and now I'm having some pretty serious
second thoughts. Here are my cogitations:

1) Why should a very learned scholar have fast reflexes? Or for that
matter, an accomplished artist or technician? Personally, I don't think
that my ranks/experience in  my technical field have any bearing
whatsoever on my speed of reflex.

2) We point to certain people (athletes, pilots, etc) as having fast
reflexes. I don't think it is true that they DEVELOP them, I think that
having them is a PREREQUISITE to being in the fields that they are in.

I know that people have been arguing (Jeff ;-) That musicians (for
instance) need speed to do their thing- I don't really think that this
is true. What musicians need is timing, not raw speed. Remember that the
scale of speed that we are talking about here is very small- sub-second
range. And why should a musician be faster at ducking a thrown bottle?
(Don't answer that!! ;-)

>I like the STM/3 change.  When you reduced the effect of level factor to
>LVF/10 I was afraid that the system would favor high level characters

You think this is true? Do you realize that Stephen is faster than Chuck
in PCF skills? 

Here is where I was headed, tell me if I'm crazy.

1) Speed is based far more on Stats than has been accounted for. Who
have some of the fastest reflexes/action speeds around? Teenagers. While
they lack the DSC to always make the RIGHT action, they still make some
fo the fastest actions.

2) STM is too broad. I just can't buy into it. The old weighted system
was better. Also, it is a double kicker- a high facter adds twice, once
to STM, and then again directly.

3) I think the factor addition is still too small.

So I was thinking something more like: (the factors may need tweaking- I
don't like the /8 either, but 10 is too much and 5 is too small)

(DSC - 10)/2 + (AGL-10)/2 + LVF/8

This is more heavily stat based and more heavily SPECIFIC skill based-
it will keep those damned bookworms and mages from winning at slappsies.
What do you think?

I am not sacrificing the average stat concept- just when I did some
preliminary (and by no means, I fully admit, exhaustive) number
crunching it seemed like this set of formulas required a two point
drop.  SO I just plunked and extra -4 in the DSC formula.  You could
also write the formula as:
	(DSC-10)/2 + STM/3 + LVF/10 - 2

Critical difference?  No.  I just thought the minus two would generate
more reasonable numbers.   I could do STM/4?:-) [See upcoming speed 
post in response to Myth, Mark and Geoff]

I agree.  I have no problem with going to (DRV - 10) instead of 
(DRV - 10)/2.  The HTK to damage ration does work.  If no one objects

Okay- this is a tough one.  Usually an artist, scholar, or engineer has
no reflexes to speak of!;-) In 95% of cases where someone is running in
Bardic Tales the VHF, PCF rule of dominance applies.  

However- Geoff, Joe, and I (and reluctantly Lara:-)) went over it and
one of the conclusions we (at least Geoff and I- Joe was having too much
fun playing devil's advocate to do anything constructive like 
agreeing to something!:-);-)) came to was that there is a another thing 
we do not currently model in Bardic Tales which i am afraid to even 
talk about modeling. That is that people who take actions under duress, 
threat of life and limb etc.  Build fast reflexes in that area.  VHF and
PCF happen to be full of that and obvious.  However, imagine if you will
the following scenarios and ask yourself if that person would have a
fighter pilot or warrior's reflexes....

MCF: The gun slinger/gambler of the Old West.
AGF: Stunt man who does multi-stage, acrobatic stunts (this is a 
     weak one in some ways)
DXF: Pick-pocket
KIF: Beats me.  I couldn't think of one one for this.  Anyone?
SCF: Combat mage
DVF: Priest of No_rennnan(They conjure Fire Demons whose main intent 
     in life is to eat the Priest and then the priest has to bind and 
     banish them lickety split....:-)
INF: Game show participant;-) 
TCF: Netrunner battling black ice.
SKF: Couldn't think of a good one here either.  ( The pottery is about 
     to be over baked- QUICK- douse the fire!:-))
CTF: A bard in a riddling contest with a dragon...

Should we split between physical and mental reaction?  Where do we stop?
SPD sucks to model.  

We could add a secondary LVF.  LVF/20... say you are doing martial arts.
You could use PCF/10 as your primary and then AGF/20 as your
secondary...

We could also lower the STM number to compensate. 

So:

SPD = (DSC - 10)/2 + STM/4 +LVF/10 + LVF/20 - 2

Well- that is the question.  Is there an increase in SPD becaus of 
general growth of experience? 

Some say no.  Some say yes, but limited and some say absolutley.  
I  am a ""yes, but limited"" man myself.  Thus the proposed change to /4
on STM.  <shrug>

AGL - 10 huh?  However SPD is used often on strictly mental things
(spell casting, technolgy, etc.) so AGL is not a common denominator.  

PROPOSED CHANGE:

We could go (DSC + {Appropriate Stat} -20)/2 +STM/4 + LVF/10 + LVF/20 -2

>>  WITH SPEED FORMULA
>>    (DSC - 14)/2 + STM/3 + LVF/10


[Mark]

     
1) Why should a very learned scholar have fast reflexes? Or for that 
matter, an accomplished artist or technician? Personally, I don't think 
that my ranks/experience in  my technical field have any bearing 
whatsoever on my speed of reflex.
     
     
[Myth]

Hm.  An unfortunately good point.  (And I was just getting used to E-Man as 
having useful numbers of speed points, too. Sigh.)


[Mark]

2) We point to certain people (athletes, pilots, etc) as having fast 
reflexes. I don't think it is true that they DEVELOP them, I think that 
having them is a PREREQUISITE to being in the fields that they are in.


[Myth]

Rats.  Another good point.  Just goes to show the dangers of thinking 
about these things on your own time.

Of course, it does support my sub-point a while back about a combat 
reflexes advantage, seperate from SPD.


[Mark]

Here is where I was headed, tell me if I'm crazy.

1) Speed is based far more on Stats than has been accounted for. [...]

     
2) STM is too broad. I just can't buy into it. [...] Also, it is a 
double kicker- a high facter adds twice, once to STM, and then again 
directly.
     
3) I think the factor addition is still too small.


[Myth]

Well, 1) is a conceptual thing.  Is speed a constant, or does it change 
dramatically as the character advances?  I could (and probably will) argue both

sides of this, but would prefer it not be too complicated.

Point 2) is hard to argue with.  STM, as I understand it, is the quickest 
correlation to the old D&D 'levels.'  If that is why it is in the SPD formula, 
then the Level Factor should probably not count.  (After all, the skill itself 
counts a great deal; a high=level skill really has a triple whammy.)

Number 3), though, I disagree with.  As long as the whole world is using the 
same standard, does it really matter that the numbers were higher (or lower) 
before?  Besides, LVF is something that's going to be added on a regular basis;

/8 is much trickier (and slower, in combat) than /10.
     
     
[Mark]

So I was thinking something more like: (the factors may need tweaking- I 
don't like the /8 either, but 10 is too much and 5 is too small)
     
(DSC - 10)/2 + (AGL-10)/2 + LVF/8
     
This is more heavily stat based and more heavily SPECIFIC skill based- 
it will keep those damned bookworms and mages from winning at slappsies. 
What do you think?
     
     
[Myth]

But I *liked* wining at slappsies!

Oh, sorry.

I like the ""(DS-10)/2 + (AG-10)/2"" bit.  It gets us back to the 'Stat-10' 
model that Jeff is so fond of.  As stated above, I'd prefer a LVF/10 to the 
proposed LVF/8.

Normal humans (with no major skills) will have a SPD of zero.  Megastat 
monsters (the Batman Type) will have a SPD of 10, plus LVF mods of maybe 
another 10 or so.  

E-Man, using magic, would have a SPD of 4 + 1 + 5, or 10. (at 1/10)
                                           or + 7, for 12 (at 1/8).

(Yes, it really is all about me.  Ha!)

Getting closer. . . .  maybe some simplification is still possible
though, since (STAT-10) *2 is part of the LVF already. I hate to say it
too, but a separate physical and mental speed base may be the way to go.

I still don't like STM in there.

Remember the example of the netrunner fighting a virus or something like
that.....  I agree that general speed should be lower and
factor-specific and skill-specific ranks should be more weighted.

Disagree.  I think :
(1) Characters can take quickstrike skills.
(2) I think clutzes (even me) can learn to be fast using particular 
skill sets. 
(3) Ther eis truth that the process wees out people with slow reaction
speeds.

I think more experienced people in any field can react faster and
handle/process new data quicker in general.  I agree it is not major. 
Perhaps STM/5?

LVF is important- I think we all agree that a person very experienced 
at fighting in general will be faster than somone who isn't.  

I think that general experience also does (see above) but that is
clearly not a shared thought.  

I think the primary skill itself the most influential variable.

SIgh- remember I actually believe that general experience gives you

Notice that Mark has cleverly changed the topic from ""reaction speed""
which can be physical OR mental to ""reflexes"" which typically refer only
to physical actions?  Fortunately I was too quick (mentally) to fall for
that ;-)

Actually I was arguing that Alex applies speed to both physical and
mental situations, but that the stat based almost entirely on physical
skills.  Perhaps Alex's example of a TCF virtual reality battle is a
better example.

I don't have a problem with that ;-)  Actually I believe it is also true
in the current system and even in the system you proposed.  I do agree
that STM is probably still overpowered in the STM/3 LVF/10 formula, but
I really believe that general life experience helps people understand,
evaluate and react to situations more quickly.  Obviously skill should
have more to do with it, which is why LFV AND Skill AND Secondaries go
into the total formula.  I think my original proposal was STM/2 +
LVF/2.  Obviously this generated numbers that were uncomfortably high
for Alex, but I think the proportion was pretty good.  Maybe STM/5,
LVF/5?

It is only a significant ""double kicker"" when it is a high factor and
the character is performing a skill in that factor.  I don't have a
problem with that either.

Agreed.

If you get rid of the -3 (which you should do) Stephen comes out a few
points lower in speed in his best LVFs than he is in the current system.
Based on Stephen, my one data point, I would suggest:
    (DSC - 10)/2 + STM/5 + LVF/5
This would put him right where he currently is in his best LVFs and
several points lower in the others. 

I think you have to make a decision about complexity versus realism.  We
can argue forever finding ridiculous examples on the edge of any model,
asking why one remote skill should affect another.  I think there is
enough of a belief in the influence of ""general life experience"" to
justify putting STM in if you feel it should be in there, granting that
it is never going to be a perfect model.

If you are willing to go one step more complex, I think one area of
general agreement, and the focal point of all the ""why should skill X
influence skill Y"" arguements is the division between mental and
physical skills.  I have chosen to make this split in my system, and I
think BT would support it well.  LVFs are already divided into mental
and physical.  If you wanted to go this route you could even adapt the
above formula (mine, of course, not yours ;-) by calculating a
""mini-STM"" for mental and physical LVFs (like an average of all physical
LVFs and an average of all mental LVFs):

   Physical speed = (DSC-10)/2 + ""Phys STM""/5 + LVF/5
   Mental speed = (DSC-10)/2 + ""Mental STM""/5 + LVF/5

Or if you want to keep some influence of life experience in physical
skills affecting mental and vice versa, you could do something like:

   Physical speed = (DSC-10)/2 + STM/10 + Phys STM/10 + LVF/5

This stacks the deck more and more in favor of the specific skill and
type of skill (physical vs. mental), but still keeps the STM concept.  I
have a dire prediction to make about going _too_ far in this direction,
but I think I'll wait to see if anyone actually mentions it...

Uh-huh.  This example, like most of the examples thrown out on the floor, is of

a person reacting quickly in his specialty area.. mages cast quicker than 
non-mages, fighters fight faster, drivers drive faster, engineers engine
faster,
etc.  While this is hard to argue with, it is not really the point.

The point is whether good engineers fight faster than bad ones, whether good 
mages drive faster than mere apprentices.

And, just to throw salt on the fire, Mark has pointed out that some of the 
higher-speed professionals may have become such due to fast natural reflexes, 
rather than developing those reflexes as they became more skilled.

To restate the questions (I love restating things), what we have is:

1- Are some people notably faster than others?  
        [Well, yeah.]

2- Is this difference related to differing attributes?  
        [Again, yeah.]

3- Do people get faster in a skill as they develop expertise?  
        [Yeah. *How* much of my grade depends on this?]

4- Do people get faster in related skills as they develop expertise in one?  
        [Probably.]

5- Do people get faster in all skills as they develop expertise in one?
        [Well, ther's the rub.  I don't think so, other people do.]

  [Myth]

Well, I agree with both Alex and Mark.  I don't think that anything Mark said 
precludes any of Alex's statements.

Characters *can* take quickstrike skills.  Some characters need them to
survive.
 Even quick-reacting characters will want extra speed points.

Klutzes *can* become fast with a particular skill.  They have skill-to-SPD 
points (Rank-2) and LVF bonuses (of whatever magnitude).

  [Myth]

My favorite at the moment is (DS-10)/2 + (AG-10)/2 + STM/10 + LVF/10

The math is simple, it acknowledges the need to notice and move, higher-level 
characters will be a point or two faster, and everyone will be better off in 
their chosen field.

Ah, well.  I'm thinking on my own time again.  Bad habit.

Yes! Which is why I keep emphasizing that LVF should have more of an
impact than STM. And that's numerically, not relying on the data that
says that typical characters have lower STMs than LVFs in a given area. 

I disagree that generally experienced people make faster decisions and
action. I think it is just plain wrong. They make BETTER decisions, but
if anything, the more experienced people seem to make _SLOWER_
decisions. They weigh more factors, more data, more stuff. Remember that
we are talking about sub-second numbers here!! REALLY REALLY fast stuff.
Just not a factor in most people's lives.

An example that I sent Alex last night- I play a lot of volleyball. (I
think you all know that ;-) I am exposed to a wide range of ages, skill
levels, and physical talent. When it comes to raw speed, high skill
levels rule, with physical talent right there. It isn't clear to me that
the two are separable. (** ) The President and founder of my company
plays with us- he is an extremely high level engineer, salesman, leader,
and skiier. He plays a lot of soccer, and has been playing volleyball
for several years. He is not as fast as I am. He probably never will be.
His STM is easily double, maybe triple mine. His AGF is probably
similar.

Jeff has valid points about mental and physical speeds, and I like his
concept of having two speeds. Anything to keep the two from washing into
each other!


					Markd



**You could easily make an argument (just to digress) that physical
stats strongly limit the effective level of a player. Even though
someone knows what to do, if they are not fast/strong/dexterous enough,
they may never be able to do it, no matter how much they practice.

"BTR6A - the Speed Formula","Ahem!  Wow!  Great conversation.   Thanks to everyone who contributed.  
The proposed new speed formulaS(2 of them) are at the bottom of the
post.  This is a long but worthwhile post (please read and respond to 
if you can)

My guess as to Geoff's Dire Prediction:  ""Gee, you know the old speed
formula did that really well with its layed-out level factors. 
Let's just go back to that!"":-):-)

I like what Myth did.  ""Let me explain.  No, not enough time, let me 
sum up!""

Our intention is to derive a formula that will give us a number which
we can use to model the time it takes anyone to react to stimuli in 
ANY situation.  Okay. 

We had one. It was:
(DSC + AGL -20)/2 + PCF/10 + VHF/10 + AGF/10 + DXF/10 + SCF/20

But NOOOOO.. that wasn't good enough!;-)  Some people correctly pointed
out that we were using that formula for every type of speed and it made
martial artists and drivers faster at calculus.  So we began looking 
at alternatives.  At the time, in my all-seeing and all-knowing wisdom, 
 I flatly rejected having two speeds.  Ahem....

The objects we have to work with to create this new number are:
The character's Statistics. 
The level factors associated with the action(s) being performed.
The skill being utilized.
The skills closely related to those skills(secondaries)
The person's general experience in life.  
Situational modifiers(physical/mental state, time flow rate:-), etc.)

Let me now state somethings that appear to be generally agreed upon,
some of which we even have more than anecdotal evidence for!;-)

(1) Fast people are fast.  Slow people are slow.
  
*SIGH*  This profound, yet true, truth does appear to have some 
correlate in the real world.  Unfortunately I think people in real 
life do have structural and programmed in speeds which guide what 
kind of professions they go into etc.  Do I think people can learn to be
fast? Yes. Do I, against what I naively think is fair, beleive that
faster people can be trained to be even faster than slower people?  
YEP.  Therefore in a realism model- stats would be VERY important to
speed and would provide somesort of horrible cap as Mark suggested.
I am willing to model stats being important- but will not model the 
cap on player fun principles.

(2) People are fastest in their specialty skills. 

I think we can all agree that some combination of LVF and SKill and
secondaries should be the greatest component of SPD.  I personally think
that in the highest levels LVF could give more SPD points than the skill
itself.  I think as people move up in an area of skill they begin to 
master the principole disticntions in the area and start inventing
actions and skills from the concepts behind it.  Did that make any
sense?  All I am saying is LVF is important. 

(3) Older people are NOT faster. If anything they are slower. 

I give.  Uncle.  Stop hititng me with reality. It hurts.
  
(4) Do people get faster in all skills as they develop expertise in one?

[Myth]  Well, ther's the rub.  I don't think so, other people do.
[Alex]	i want to think that!  Please Auntie Em!  DAMN!  Here is the
honest to God truth as I know it (in other words- my opinion!:-)): 
I don't think so either.  

Unfortunately there is limited interaction between widely divergent
skill areas.  Tech writers do not have higher reaction speeds as far as
I can tell.  I know tech writers who seem to be physically fast but they
are martial artists or athletes.  I know tech writers who seem to be 
physically slow- and they are not martial
artists and athletes.  Hmmmm..... 

HOWEVER:  I do think there is sufficient bleedover between physical
skills that someone who is a fast martial artist will be quicker at
catching a ball out of the air, or even... picking a lock?  Shooting a
bow?   *SHRUG*  
 
I think it might be worth having (God it is so painful agreeing with
Geoff so much!;-)) a physical speed and a mental speed.  Or rather i
think it is worth having one SPEED formula but have it use:
(a) either physical or mental STM
(b) the appropriate LEVEL Factor
(c) (DSC and INT) for mental; and (DSC and AGL) for physical?

Then primaries skill would give (RANK - 2), and secondaries and general 
skills give (Rank - 2)/2. 

If we accept that, the question becomes one of scale/weighting both for
realism and for playability.  Remember inititive is rolled on 2d6, so
half of what this formula generates in an average, medium scale 
character should not be higher than 6 or so INCLUDING RANK MODS!

What is most important: Primary skill?  I think, at the very least 
that is what we want to model.  So, at normal levels the primary skill
should have the most influence.(Obviously if someone has a 30 Agility
or a 193 LVF the primary skill may occasionally get overshadowed!:-)) 

Let us look at the formula.
(c) STATS: 
The standard formula for stat influence is (STAT - 10)/x  where
X is often 2.  With two stats (DSC + INT - 20)/2 generates a range 
from -8 to +8 speed.  Your average starting BT character will have a 
3 SPD based on stats.  That sounds okay... 8 is a lot and it requires 
2 18s.  This would be too large for me but remember the stat
conversation above.  However it may be too large as stats figure
prominantly in the Level Factors and STMs.  If we go with the /2 a 
volley ball player of RANK 10 with a 10 DSC and AGL would be the same
speed as a RANK 2 volleyball player of 18 DSC and AGL. Does that 
sound right?  That is an uncomfortable strenth of stat for me though 
it is an extreme case...

(b) LEVEL FACTOR:
I think it is clear from our conversations that the appropriate LVF-
the one for the skill grouping being used is important.
If we use LVF/5[/2, /4, /5, or /10 are just so much easier than other 
divs...) then a person with a LVF of 10(first level character:-)) would
have 2 spd points from that.   An LVF 50(quite a high level character)
would have 10 spd points and be faster then stats would give a double 18
person. A LVF 100 person(extraordinarily high level) would have 20 spd
points.  When you crunch the numbers for likely RANKs to generate those
kinds of Level Factors  that measn somewhere around 60 or 70 LVF the 
level factor becomes more influential than the skill itself in speed.  
Truthfully- I am okay with that.  LVF/10 gives obviously a smaller
spread.   It would have the primary skill be more important until you
were well into the 100s.   Lets go with that.  Say LVF/10.

(c) STM
*SOB*  *WHINE* CRY!!!!!   SOme of us (Jim and I) think STM is an
important addition to SPEED.  But, the majority of you disagree and 
even went so far as to produce well-thought-out arguments against.
So there.  I think it is worth including an STM.  Let us have a physical
and a mental STM(I am convinced that whatever bleedover there is is not
worth modeling between mental and physical).  By the way there are
skills which could go either way, right?  You could even argue VHF could
go either way, right?  Too bad!:-) Also notice this will make MLF and
PLF smaller than STM was.  You caused this!:-):
MLF (Mental Level Factor): (SCF + KIF + INF + TCF + SKF + CTF + DVF)/10
PLF (Physical level Factor): (PCF + MCF + DXF + AGF + VHF)/10 

The speed effect in formula would be: XLF/5.  A little tiny effect.

This also impacts Saving throws(this made me happy when I realized the
potentials of a split STM).  Most are obvious.  What about System Shock?
Do I keep STM for system shock?

SO... Drum roll please... the proposed formulas:

MSD(Mental Speed): (DSC + INT - 20)/2 + LVF/10 + MLF/5
PSD(Physical SPD): (DSC + AGL - 20)/2 + LVF/10 + PLF/5

Look familiar at all? *SOB*

I think this is flat wrong.

Older people in declinging health are slower yes, but your system
already models this through stat drops with age.

How many thimes I have I heard the expression that while
a person has physically declined, their mind is still very sharp.

Go talk to a few aged scholars and see if they aren't better of
for their years and experience.

Now an older person who has lost mental stats wouldn't be
as quick, but again this goes to the stat lost due to age thing.

In all the talks I had with Jeff about this we always talked about the
reaction pahse not the action phase.  I think it is definetly true that 
any life experience helps poeple to understand new situations/parse 
stimuli

Example:

high level martial artist is faced with a tough calculus problem
he will very quickly react and know that he is being face with a 
problem he cannot solve.  His action speed would then suck
as he stands there and says Duhhh!  Of course he could react
lightening fast to punch the person how gave him the problem :)

>skills that someone who is a fast martial artist will be quicker at

>bow?   *SHRUG*  

I agree with this.  Jeff and I discussed three different peices of the speed
formula each with a different wieght

1. General Life experience (STM) 		- Weight X
2. Experiece in a similar skill 		- Weight X(2)
3. Experience in the specific skill		- Weight X(4)

Now 1 could be even furthur defined to Mental STM and Pysical STM
but that tend to diliute the prinicple.  And just using STM would be
more playable.

Only comment I have here, not really a complaint, is that a 60 or 70 LVF
means the character has a boatload of secondaries, and is likely at
significantly more that +6 or 7 due to skill.

I like it, overall. I think the m/p break is worth modelling, especially
if this is the extent of the pain. Well, I'm sure we'll find a couple
more places that it will wash into, but this is pretty simple.

Just for reference-
Chuck- MSD ~8
           PSD (PCF) 15

If you want to deflate speed, you could still use a subtraction. This
makes Chuck marginally faster at PCF, and significantly slower at that
thinking stuff.

Another deflation possibility is that you could require more mental
reactions when characters are surprised or faced with a complex
situation.

Jim's suggestion of splitting sys shock could work- or you just add PLF
and MLF, which gives the same result as the old STM. I can see system
shock as one of the few places where physical and mental overlap!!

What we are talking about is time on the scale of .02 seconds. I agree-
as I said, older people make BETTER decisions. But they are not FASTER
at making them.

I don't think he should react quickly at all! I think he would have to
figure out what all those squiggly lines are! He could react quickly to
being handed a piece of paper, but not to realizing that this is a tough
calc problem.

I disagree- I think the split whould be made. For the same reasons INF

I don't currently have an aging systemn in place.  It is an even
trickier topic than SPEED and not a can of worms I am going to open now.

So in BT people do not slow down because of age unless you role-play it 
that way.

I agree- but think of their skill levels.  They have had time to

I agree.  Thus my stand for keeping some in.  But when Jim and I looked
into this several years ago there wasn't ANy data to support any speed 
benefit from cross-fertilization of skill and experience and some data
that
directly went against it.  Jim- can you pull out some of that stuff?

*SHRUG*  I think the Martial Artist will react more slowly to stimuli 
that is a spoken question, while a mathematician will react more

Joe, your computer thinks it is 1995, so I almost didn't see your posts
at the top of my inbox.

Jim (Jackl-Mochel), your computer thinks I have a movie screen instead
of a laptop.  Can't you limit your characters per line for those of us
without a Sparc station? ;-)

Ack! No!  Don't deflate it any more!  The physical speed formula
basically takes the old formula, divides the contribution of level
factors by 5, then lets you add one back.  If anything I would increase
the contribution of MLF and PLF, they are pretty paltry.  And I don't
know about anyone else, but Stephen has been ""deflated"" across the
board, thank you very much ;-)

This ideal I like, but I'm not sure how you would model it.

No, actually I haven't stepped back, I just WORK during the day, so I
don't send out a reply to each post ;-)  (I try to make up for that in
length).  I still believe that life experience helps you in the REACTION
phase.  It's effect should be significantly less than the effect of
skill and similar skills, but I still think it is there.  The problem is
that there is no good way to separate all of these factors in the real
world.  You cannot accurately rate Mark's rank in volleyball, similar
sports, DSC, AGL and STM versus the president of the company.  And maybe
Mark's STM is higher than he realizes! ;-)  I could cite several counter
examples, like the less physically fit executive who bolted across the
plant floor to shut down a burst solvent line while several young
athletic operators, who were also supposed to know the system inside and
out, stood by and went ""Guh.""  He wasn't physically faster, but he
committed to, and completed his course of action before many of them
even realized what had happened.  I think it was because he immediately
understood what had happened and how to solve the problem.

Fact is that since we cannot accurately dissect all the ""stats"" and
""factors"" of real life people, we can only take a stab at what ""feels""
right.  And I say, particularly in a gaming system, that a small effect
of level/STM/world experience is still warranted.

"Re: BTR6A - the Speed Formula","A couple more thoughts on why STM should still go into speed...

I think the current perception formula is a good example of what ""feels
right"" and is playable.  Many LVFs go into perception to the point where
it is similar to STM in that high level characters are generally likely
to have higher perceptions.  In real life you would have a hard time
convincing me that a gourmet chef would be more likely to notice a
sniper on a distant roof than anyone else.  For that matter, you would
have a hard time convincing me that a great martial artist would. 
Still, I like the fact that higher ""level"" characters are more
perceptive.  Even though it is ridiculous to try to apply a broad
concept like ""level"" to real life, it is completely appropriate and
useful in a gaming system.

Consider the characters who are likely to have high STMs.  They will
generally be older more experienced NPCs or PCs who have run a lot. 
Either way they are people who have seen and experienced a lot.  I think
it is appropriate for them to be a little faster, even though I could
never dig up discrete data to prove it.  Sure there may be the
occasional librarian with a 300 INF and a 50 STM, but how likely is
Chuck to battle him to the death?  Come to that, how much would a couple
speed points help a librarian in a battle to the death against Chuck?

I would still propose putting STM (as is) into speed on top of the
currently proposed formulas.  I would suggest STM/10, but STM/20 is
probably easier for most others to swallow.  That would give at most 1-2
speed points to fairly high level characters in a system where you need
8-10 to make a big difference.

"Re: BTR6A - the Speed Formula Survey","Okay.  Let's take a vote.  (I am going to pretend it is a democracy, 
for a second).  

It sounds like people are, in general, happy with the formulas for 
speed as they have been presented.  However Joe, and Geoff have
indicated a strong feeling for putting STM in as well- even if in a 
minor fashion.  I am willing to do that but do not feel strongly 
about it.  There also has been discussion about the scale of division
of the LVF and the meta level factors(PLF and MLF)

I would like to finalize (*GASP*) the SPEED formula so please 
respond (directly to me not the whole list) to the
following questions/ideas.  These represent the things still in
question.  When I get people's response I will tally them and 
make my final decisions.  Feel free to post to the list by the 
way if you have something for everyone in your post.  (Don't 
want to suppress anyone).

SPEED FORMULA:
(1) Leave it as described in yesterdays post.

(2) Add STM/20

(3) Add STM/10

(4) Increase the meta level factor effects(MLF and PLF) from /5 to /4

(5) Increase the meta level factor effect from /5 to /3

(6) Increase the meta level factor effect from /5 to /2

(7) Increase LVF effect from /10 to LVF/5

Obviously, there wll be crossover points.  I'd also like to point out, 
though, that with a 60 or 70 LVF, the person has spent a *lot* of time 
learning agility-skills or driving-skills or whatever.  I don't think a 
crossover is that out of line.  (To be fair, my characters tend more to be 
generalists, and are more more likely to reach the 70 LVF from several 
dozen mid-range skills than half a dozen superhigh ones.  This may be 
biasing me somewhat.)

  I like the LVF/10 idea.  I like it a lot.  Simple, easy math.

  I also like the Stat-10.  Tens are cool.

  As far as MLF and PLF, though, I don't like them.  Their use is too specific 
  to the speed formula(e), and might as well be handled directly in the
formulae
  themselves.

[Myth]

  Uh-oh.  Mark's not gonna like me anymore.

  First of all, the individual LVFs are now reduced to a combined /50.  
  This is not a very large effect, and could probably be replaced in the 
  formula with a straightforward /100 calculation (easy!) without much 
  effect on the oferall number except for a few overskilled characters. 
  (You know who you are!)
  
  Second, I'm not sure if the mental/physical breakdown is the right place 
  to stop.  After all, with the LVF addition, we're effectively making an 
  AGF-Speed, a PCF-speed, and all the rest.  Why muck about with this 
  midrange mental/physical stuff at all?  Go right to the level factor, 
  calculate your speed, and be done with it.  I'd drop the STM addition, 
  while I was at it.  Leave it there for saving throws (that WAS the 
  original idea, no?) and not much else.
     
     
[More Myth]
  As long as I'm waxing heretical, you might want to consider (Stat-10) for 
  the level factors, rather than your (Stat-10)*2.  The higher resultant 
  numbers seem to be causing indigestion in other parts of your system.

Which is what I think is really the right answer. But I am willing to
allow the STM stuff in if it is split P/M to keep those IRRITATING

And how long did this take? From the description, more than 2 seconds,
right?  I can't emphasize this enough- the numbers we are talking about
are less than 1 second intervals!!! Reaction time is completely washed
out after a couple of seconds!!! (maybe even faster- I'm too weak to do
the math)

I am tempted to build a little electronic test to measure reaction times
so we can some form of hard data. Hmm. Maybe one of those kids games? I
saw one at Christmas that was pretty good. ... . I can't remember that
name, but is was like a big jack (the kind you pick up while the ball is
bouncing) where each end was a different color. One of the games would
call out a color, and you had to turn it so that that color was facing
up. It would call them faster and faster until you blew it. What do you
guys think? Would that be useful data? It would be dex and dsc.

mainly reflex based, and performed in a well understood setting (playing
volleyball, sparring in martial arts, etc.)  I actually agree with most
of what you have said in regard to these types of situations, but I
believe they are only a subset of the possible situations one encounters
in real life (or in BT for that matter).

In a reflex situation, muscle memory and natural ability are the most
important.  That is why AGL, LVF and Skill + Secondaries contribute the
large majority of speed points in any of the proposed formulas. 
However, many situations in BT are surprise, new or unique where
characters must figure out what is going on first, possibly even before
reflexes kick in.  (We have all heard many stories about very competant
martial artists getting nailed with a couple surprise punches before
their training kicks in).  When the situation is not fully understood,
that is when DSC and I still believe STM (at a lower level), are
critical.

I agree with what you said, but disagree with your conclusion. 
_Reaction_ time in BT is 2d6--0.4 to 2.4 seconds with 1.4 average.  That
is the amount of time (unmodified) somebody would stand around before
_starting_ an action.  In my experience, that is a pretty reasonable
timeframe.  In my example, the exec. finished completed everything in
about 2-3 seconds.  The others were still in their reaction phase when
he was done.  The fact that reaction time is washed out after a couple
of seconds does not mean that a couple of seconds is an insignificant
amount of time.  In fact, I have been arguing that those few seconds can
be critical.  But, I do not necessarily believe that _reaction_ speed
spills over into action speed.

Alex, Joe and I discussed the idea that it would be more realistic to
have separate reaction speeds (probably based on DSC, maybe STM) and
action speeds (probably based on Skill, LVF, Stats).  Even Alex (wisely
I think) balked at the idea of making speed that complex, so all of
these factors got rolled into one formula which is meant to roughly
model all the various situations a character might have to react to.

Finally, I think presets help (at least a little) to model reflexes.  In
a well-defined situation like volleyball or martial arts sparring, you
can make much more use of presets.  I imagine you have a preset to hit
the ball when it comes to you, and probably even know in advance where
you want to hit it.  Likewise, many martial arts teach block, kick, or
block, punch combinations so that the martial artist has a preset
response to an incoming attack.  You could argue that presets do not go
far enough, but they do significantly reduce the reaction time which is
the difference between DSC based and reflex based REactions.

  Interestingly enough, my brother constructed such a device for his IQP, 
  several years ago.  It was part of an exhibit on reaction times for the 
  New England Science Center.  I dunno it it's still on display, but some 
  of our NESC connections might have access to data if it is.

The intention was to make stats more important- it has done that

I'm not. Kidding that is. Chuck's numbers:

PCF speed: 25.28, with an 11.68 before LVF
Avg  MSD : 10.69, with an 8.29 before LVF

Seems high to me. Not that I'm complaining, mind you. ;-) But it seems
really high. To measure generalist vs specialist- Jeff? Do you have

I didn't have him handy, but now I do...

In BT 5.0 Stephen had a 20 SPD

In BT 6.0 with the old speed formula but new level factors he had a 23.2

With the proposed formulas Stephen has these base speeds without LVF:
   pSPD of 18.2
   mSPD of 16.7

Using LVF/5 Stephen has a 29.0 in his highest LVF, 20.7 in his lowest,
and an average of 24.1.  If you compare to 6.0 with the old formula but
new LVFs, he gains a point on average, but as many as 6 points. 
Compared to the 5.0 formula he gains several points on average.

I also calculated LVF/10 and got a high of 23.4, low of 18.7 with an
average of 20.8.  At LVF/10, his best speed is about equal to his speed
in to 6.0 with old formula & new LVFs, and loses about 2.5 points on
average.  For Stephen, LVF/10 is a gives speeds across the board that
are very close to his old BT 5.0 speed.

Personally I think it is good that Chuck gains a lot of speed in PCF
(and maybe loses some relatively in mental skills).  The point was to
widen the gap and make people better in their specialty.  To my mind,
the important thing is whether peoples' _average_ speed increases.  And
what are we measuring against, btw?  Speed from BT 5.0 or BT 6.0 old
formula, new LVFs?  What were Chuck's changes in speed from these
systems?

LVF/10 makes an 18 for PCF, and about a 9 for everything else. (For
Chuck, of course) This is a 4 point boost in my specialty and a 5 point
drop in everything else. Signifiacant average drop, but then I am a
specialist.

See above. I agree- I think faster in specialties, slower in general is
the way to go. /5 seems to give numbers that are a little too high
though. I really like /8 even though the math is slightly harder. Its
still just a /2, dammit! Is that so hard to stomach?? How many character
will not have pre-calculated their LVF additions?

Can everyone on the list supply the following for their character.:
DSC,INT, AGL
Highest LVF, Lowest (non-zero)LVF
MLF, PLF (mental and physical LVFs added up and divided by 10.
STM (all LVFs /10)

The above formula generates numbers that are too high.  Here is how 
it is looking:

> >> >PSD(Physical SPD): (DSC + AGL - 20)/2 + LVF/10 + PLF/3 + STM/20

This generates the following ranges:
STATS: 1 point per 2 (-8 to +8 SPD)
LVF:   1 point per 10 level factor points (currently -10 to 20 SPD)
PLF/MLF: 1 point per 3, which is 1 per 30 individual contributing 
level factor points.(currently  1 to 12 SPD)
STM: 1 for 20, or 1 per 200 individual contributing level factor
point.(currently .05 to 1.9)

BTW:  i am going to be calling STM ""Total Level Factor(TLF)"" in the DOC 
set so prepare yourselves.;-)

We could have KIF/20 in both formulas.  I think there is a certain 
amount of sense to that.  Thoughts?  

No, there is alot of sense to that.  KIF really is a bridge stat 
between the physical and the mental.   Let's do it!

     Hm.  Would this be replacing any of the dozen-or-so perceptions 
     out there?  I think you already have an LVF-Perception skill for

     Hm.  Would this be replacing any of the dozen-or-so perceptions out 
     there?  I think you already have an LVF-Perception skill for each

(drum roll please):
MSD(Mental Speed): (DSC + INT - 20)/2 + MLF/3 + TLF/20 + LVF/10
PSD(Physical SPD): (DSC + AGL - 20)/2 + PLF/3 + TLF/20 + LVF/10

I think it does too, but it is only really workable for physical
perceptions.  All i am proposing is adding a mental perception default
like PER, using the same rules as PER, but for mental perceptions.  FOr
somne character sit will rarely come in use.  FOr others it will be 
very useful.  It provides a dfault human perception for every tytpe of
perception.  PER for physical, MPR for mental, MAP for magical.

I do- and that is why I have those skiolls because I think there are 
people who specialize in speed and some who specialize in accuracy 
above and beyond the tradeoff. I want to model that.

It was a weak concept.  But it seemed logical at the time.

You still have your tradeoff.:-)  A -60 ain't so bad!  You can 
eliminate that by being in stance with a two handed grip and some 
set-up!  I realize it would take a -20 to have 0 mods for a called shot
head but that is okay with me.   Now as to how called hot skills would
collapse into each other:  

Add the initial skill value of the skill ranks. Those are thus:

1-4 = 1-4
5   = 6
6   = 8
7   = 12
8   = 20 
9   = 36
10  = 68

You have an 8 and a 4?  Therefor ethat is 4 + 20 = 24.  You can
therefore convert that into a hmmm...
8=20, 9=36, the difference is 16, therfore every 1.6 ISL = a .1...if we
round up that gives you an 8.3 in called shot!;-)  Did anyone not 
follow that?:-)

No- It would just add a mental default for mental perceptions just 
like there is a physical default for physciacl perceptions(PER)

[Alex, to block]

What did I miss here?  Those ARE parallel formulas!


[Myth (big finish)]

No, they are not.  They may be parallel CONCEPTS (though with a three-way
versus
a two-way split, I am not sure of even that), but the formulae are strongly 
different.

Speed = (stat base)/n + (MLF or PLF)/x + TLF/y + LVF/z

Perception (proposed) = (stat base, sometimes /4) + (some LVFs)/2 + (some 
LVFs)*2 + (skill)*3

As far as I can tell, this is a noticeably different model.


While I'm ranting, is magical perception different enough from mental 
perception to justify yet another number?

If it is, is there a magical speed, as well as a mental one?

"BT:  Weapon Damages","This is from Geoff Hodge.  It is a pretty good note- I would love
people's comments on it.  I have two comments to think about:
(1) Weapons have one fundamental adavantage over hand-to-hand skills-
range.  Now, I suspect this may have been lost in the documentation- I
need to check- but for every foot in weapon length difference the
shorter weapon addsa count to it's weapon speed.  So- while knee is a
very effective high damage strike, it has a very short weapon length.
This makes it really slowe when facing, say a club or a staff.
(2) I think low speed weapons need to do more damage or high speed
weapons like fist and dagger might need to be a little slower.
Essentially I agree with Geoff.

Here is what Geoff said.....

Hi Alex,

  As you know, I abandoned Stephen's use of weapons through Desperate
Offense in favor of martial arts training because it seemed to be more
effective.  To put that impression to the test, I just reviewed the base

damages listed for crushing attacks (which covers unarmed combat and
most weapons that would be used in Desperate Offense attacks).

  In cases of armour or high PAB, higher damaging weapons will obviously

be more effective.  In the case of an unarmoured low PAB opponent though

unarmed combat looks superior to using weapons, which is not what I
would have expected.  Hopefully I am missing some rules somewhere that
balance things out.

  Below is a theoretical excercise listing, for each type of attack, the

average damage (assuming no skill or strength bonuses), the weapon
speed, the number of counts it would take to do 40 HTK damage (assuming
you hit each time), and the number of counts it would take to do 40 HTK
(assuming a Rank 6 attacker hitting each time at +4 dam), and finally
time to do 40 HTK assuming a total of +10 dam from primary, general,
secondary skills, STR bonus, etc):

               Avg Dam  Spd  ct/40HTK  ct/40HTK@+4  ct/40HTK@+10
Fist              4      4      40         20            11
Foot              6      6      40         24            15
Knee              8      4      20         13             9
Club              7      6      34         22            14
2 Hand Club       9     12      53         37            25
Quarterstaff     11     10      36         27            19

  This example discounts advantages of weapon length and difficulty
factor which would not tip the balance much.

  For an unskilled fighter, all weapons are roughly equal in their
ability to take down an opponent.  The difficulty mods might make Club
and Fist the top choices if you had no PCF.  With a decent PCF, Knee
looks like the bargain of the century.  Generally all attacks are in the

same ballpark.  I would have expected weapons to have an advantage as
long as they are not too tricky to use.

  Things change for the worse when you add some skill.  That not only
diminishes the effect of difficulty mods, but makes the quickest attacks

more favorable.  Two weapons, 2H club and Quarterstaff are left behind,
and only club is in the running with unarmed combat attacks.  At a
decent level of skill (+10 dam), Knee and Fist are definately the way to

go.  At this skill level you could drop unarmoured opponents with
unarmed combat almost twice as fast as you could with a 2H club or
Quarterstaff.  Stephen is not very strong, and only has rank 6 in most
martial arts skills, but he still racks up +14 points of damage on an
average punch, so these are not off-the-scale examples.

  I think the damages for unarmed combat attacks are too high (or maybe
the base times are too low).  Especially for Knee.  I'll let you take
your best Knee strike to my hand if you let me take my best shot at
yours with a good oak club ;-)

  Let me know what you think, and feel free to forward this to the BT
discussion group if you deem it worthwhile.

I agree that weapon length is a major factor in combat, and adding the
count per foot to short weapons does make the damage dealt per unit time
look much more reasonable.  Maybe some small tweaking of knee and 2H
club damage is all that is needed.

I also agree with Jim's observation that weapon length rules are very
seldom used, so this nice balance doesn't make it into play much.  Maybe
what is needed is an easier way to use these rules in combat.  My other
concern about weapon length is that all of these advantages are
cancelled (in fact they are reversed) if the opponent with the shorter
weapon closes.  I think it should be much easier to escape from a press
than it is to initiate a press.  From what I have seen, jamming is very
efffective, but also very hard to maintain.  People tend to stay at the
edge of their effective weapon range, and return to that range very
quickly and easily.

Weapon length, if enforced, would solve one problem, but I see a second
problem which it does not address--that is that damage bonuses from
strength and skill can be so large that the weapon is almost
incidental.  The difference between 4 and 6 points of average damage is
significant, but the difference between 24 and 26 points is not.  Chuck
Lee could kill you with a mushy banana almost as quickly as he could
kill you with a quarterstaff because his strength and skill bonuses are
much more important than his weapon.  Even among highly trained martial
artists I think weapons are a significant advantage.

I discovered a similar problem in my system and did a couple things that
did not solve the problem, but at least minimized it.  I doubled body
points and base weapon damage and left the level of effect bonus
(similar to skill bonus) and STR bonuses the same, so that they
contributed half as much relatively.  I also put a cap on max weapon
damage.  Each weapon has a max rolled damage.  STR and success/skill
bonuses cannot contribute more than the max rolled damage.  (Although
honestly I seldom enforce this rule since I don't like caps.  I am now
thinking that maybe you could get 1 extra point of damage per 2 levels
of effect beyond the max weapon damage.)  At any rate, I would like to
see the base damage of weapons increase relative to the strength and
skill bonuses in BT.

"Re: Weapon Damages"," I am always a proponent of skill making a tremendous difference, not
becuase I think it is terribly realistic, but because I think it leads to
more dramatic play.  I would therefor lean much more towards Geoff's second
proposal, capping damage bonuses from base weapon damage in the same way
that setup bonuses are capped by base success chance.  I like the current
balance between damage due to weapon type and damage due to skill in most
cases other than the squishy banana.

Here is a guide to fighting that Chris Bowe had written at least a year ago.  I have never perused it in to much depth but I notice that it has even more detail than the BT discussions we have been having and it is based on ""real life"" experience.

Now - the question becomes:  Is that a physical-physical florentine or
aphysical-maneuver florentine?  AND
is that florentine skill a PCF skill or an ETF skill (EaTing Factor)?
This raises some very serious issues....

First off- a Q-tip would get through Borealis' PAB.  As a matter of
fact, in a recent breakthrough Borelais stopped adding damage to weapons
that struck him and now has a positive PAB!:-)  (Sorry Britt- couldn't
resist!)

On a more serious note- ther eis a cap but it is VERY high.  The cap is
in the rules and it is thus:

3*[(MAX rolled Damage)+(RANK MODS)+(MAGICAL or MATERIAL bonuses)]

This can be quite high.... FOr instance a fist wielded by Joe Average
who has no RANk at all would be: 3*[7-2+0]=3*5=15!!!!  That is pretty
damn low!!!!

Chuck's max damage with a fist is somehting like(making it up- 10 in
fist, 12 in pankido?)
3*[7+12+0:-)]=3*19=57 points.

WIth a squishy banana DAMAGE=2d4-7 CRUSHING so chuck' max damage would
be:  3*[1-2+0]=3*-1=-3 HTK unless it were a magical banana or made of
good steel.
Now- could Chuck then regenerate HTK by hitting himself with a squishy
banana...? Hmmmmmm....

I don't think it is unreasonable at all.  My issue is with what Geoff
originally pointed out that due to the frequency of strikes a person can
more easily punch an opponent to death
then a clubber can club an opponent to death all things being equal.

Maybe this isn't so bad- I brought up the idea of slowing down the
faster weapons slightly and sp-eeding up the slower weapons slightly to
make it  mor elike Jim's suggestion of STRENGTH being it!:-) Just
kidding- but making wepaons alittle more like each other.
Bardic Tales wepaons are alittle far apart.  Compare two-handed sword to
long sowrd.
Long sword is considerably more damaging over 40 counts than a
two-handed sword
is.... 44 base damage points versus, 32 base damage points- but maybe
that is not so bad.... Maybe not.... Doing alot of damage at once gets
you cool knockback(I have
been running knockback) and better system shock effects.....

Absolutley- remember- automatically you are at the longest wepaons
optimal distance that is the default.  The shorter weapon adds as many
counts as the difference in feet(rounded up) between the two weapons, it
ALSO IN ADDITION take s the retreat penalties for whateve rlevel of
retreat it is in.  RETREAT level is equal to thenumbe rof feet from
optimal wepaon distance(i.e.differnce in wpn length in feet)  Harsh!!!

I am going to have a CLOSE skill that allows on to close on a longer
weapon, and a FEND action that allows one to stop that.  The fend has to
be aloowed to be reallay fast-Maybe faster than half weapon speed?  What
do you guys think?

If you look at the table Jim did with the penalties to weapon speed for
weapon length figured in, the numbers don't really look too bad.  You
might want to decrease the base damage for unarmed attacks a bit, but I
don't think you need to do anything with the speeds as long as you
enforce the weapon length rules.

I would recommend just having one skill do both ""close"" and ""fend"" for
simplicity's sake.  I have a ""Combat Movement"" skill which acts as a
contest of skills between opponents.  For every level of success the
winner has greater than the loser, the winner can change the combat
distance by 1/2'.  In order to make long weapon length the default, you
might give something like +10% per level of press to Combat Movement to
escape from the press.

I have seen Chuck use quick-strike quite effectively when eating, so I
don't think this would be much of a problem.

Well, don't forget you get criticals too, but in general I agree.  I do
not like the idea of a cap.  It is too extreme in the opposite
direction.  I through that out more as food for thought.  (It works a
bit better in my system because weapon damages are higher in proportion
to body points.)

No, it is not at all unreasonable for a PCF 60 person to be much more
effective than an unskilled person.  I like the skill bonuses.  I just
think they are too high in proportion to the weapon based damage.  I
think Chuck should be dangerous with a mushy banana, I just think he
should be much much more dangerous with a club or staff.  When you add
20 points of damage from strenght and skill, the weapon doesn't count
for much.  I think if too martial artists squared off, one highly
skilled in punch and the other highly skilled in a weapon, the martial
artist with the weapon should still have a significant advantage.

We have several martial artists of moderate skill in the group, but even
though I am completely unskilled in club, I would trade one punch for
one club swing with any of them.  I might not be so bold with Stephen
Segal or George Forman, so there is some point at which skill bonuses
definately do outstrip the weapon damage.  My point is that I think this
level is much higher than in the current BT system.

As it stands, weapons lose their advantage as people get more skilled in
them.  Ideally point of skill would increase the rolled damage by 5% or
something like that instead of a flat point adder.  I don't like the
idea of a cap in BT either.  In my system the weapon damages are much
higher relative to body points, so a cap works a bit better.  Even at
that, I think I will change my system to allow adding one point of
damage per LoS up to the max damage of the weapon, then one point per 2
LoS beyond that.  That will let people still potentially add infinate
numbers of points, but will give an advantage to large weapons even at
high levels of skill.  I don't know if some version of this would work
in BT or not.

A person with an 18 STR and rank 10 in primary, secondary, tertiary and
G: skills would have a +32 to damage.  This is about the realistic max
for a BT character, since it is pretty difficult to go above 10.  I
would like to see the choice between a punch and a club still have an
noticeable effect even at this level.

This is a little too specific- after all, Chuck is a specialist, but not
that narrowly! Maybe a General: Hand to Mouth skill would be more
appropriate, with good ranks in Mastication and Gurgitation.

What is Menahan's PCF? I think you are probably around Chuck's rank.
Regardless, I think Chuck would mop the floor with Segal. If it was
George Foreman, the winner would probably depend on whose rules we were
using. ;-) At this point, Chuck is a professional class A open circuit
martial arts contender. I don't think he is quite ready for UFC, but
Alex might disagree. 

I think enforcing the range rules will help, and adding Combat Manuever
skills will complete it. I agree with Fend being a weapon based action.
One thing to keep in mind are close quarters- is there a model for
constricted space?

90!! And you think he is the LOWEST??? Get a little perspective! Maybe
the lowest fantasy (I don't know much about those characters), but Chuck
is probably the premier Spy Tales melee specialist, and he has a 60.

As a movie entity, Segal fights a lot of Thugs, and very few really
skilled MAs.

I guess it wouldn't affect Fend too much- assuming that there is room to
swing the weapon effectively. But Retreat, or any manuever to maintain
distance gets MUCH tougher with constricted/bad terrain.

Someone, I'm not sure who in the flurry of emails, said the above.  

To understand why Chuck is almost equally dangerous when armed with a
club, a fist or a mushy banana you have think about what he is going to
do with them in combat verses what a non-skilled combatant would do.
Let's assume for a moment that both combatants, skilled and non-skilled,
actually hit.  Now let's look at the effects:

                     Non-skilled Combatant (Borealis)
Skilled Combatant (Chuck Lee)
Club              hamburger attack #1 - Borealis strikes         Chuck
drives the club in below
                     some random target (probably in the            the
rib cage, crushes internal
                     upper torso, arms or skull...some of
organs and stunning the
                     the most heavily armored parts of the
solerplexis nerve center, 
                     human body) and does weapon damage       delivering
nasty damage and
                                                                        
                causing system shock

Fist	hamburger attack #2 - Borealis' fist strikes    Chuck's knuckles
hit the nose at
                    the jaw or chin bones, causing pain and
precisely the correct angle to
                    bruising to the face, with possible
 shatter it, driving shards of 
                    complications of tooth loss.  Borealis'
cartilage up into the brain,
                    knuckles are bruised, as well.
  killing the opponent and, 
                                                                        
                incidentally, giving him a nose

Banana         smears the banana into the face of

I parsed the above while on a boring conf call into
the below, figured I would send it out to maybe
save people a couple of minutes and perhaps a
few brain cells.

-Joe

                     
Skilled Combatant (Chuck Lee)
Non-skilled Combatant (Borealis)


Club                     

Chuck drives the club in below rib cage, crushes internal
organs and stunning the solerplexis nerve center,  
delivering nasty damage and causing system shock

Using hamburger attack #1 - Borealis strikes some random 
target (probably in the upper torso, arms or skull...some
of the most heavily armored parts of the human 
body) and does weapon damage      



Fist

hamburger attack #2 - Borealis' fist strikes the 
jaw or chin bones, causing pain and  bruising to 
the face, with possible complications of tooth 
loss.  Borealis'knuckles are bruised, as well.

Chuck's knuckles hit the nose at precisely the 
correct angle to shatter it, driving shards of 
cartilage up into the brain, killing the opponent 
and, incidentally, giving him a nose bleed 

Mushy banana attack #3 - 

Borealis savagely smears the banana into the 
face of his opponent, annoying him, while 
giving his body a much needed boost  in potassium

Chuck decisively inserts the banana through 
his opponent's eye and into his brain, causing 
instant death (which negates any potassium 
benefits from the banana)

Skill really does make a difference.

"RE: Weapon Damages","Some thoughts on how much damage a fist does and chance to hit:

I was thinking that in most of the fights I have see/participated in, the youthful
male unskilled types tend to not do general strikes against an opponent, they
tend to do called shot head (or face).

Now since most of the BT creation was based on two things (in this area)

1. People's Martial Arts experience
and
2. observation of unskilled people

how is this tendancy of unskilled people to do called shot head
affected the punch skill in Bardic Tales?

I can't remember if people were paying the called shot mods when
punching people in the face.

Jeff did you pay called shot location mods to hit the thug in the
throat the other day?

Just some thoughts

Any Comments?

"BT: Weapons","Originally this post started with massive amounts of quoting everyone
and replying to
everyone, and several jokes spinning off Mastication skills, Kyle's
comparison of what
Chuck and Borealis would each do with various weapons, and Borealis
thinking Chuck
to death.  However I am commtted to getting input form people so I will
keepo this a medium size post in the interest of those who have limited
bandwidth- because I value your input too!:-)

First off, weapon length/closing rules will be used more often  That
will resolve many
of the issues.The rules include:
    (a) 1 WSD/foot difference to shorter weapon when at longer weapons
range
    (b) Retreat mods for shorter weapons when at longer weapon range(cum
with above)
    (c) ""Combat Maneuver"" skill allows for Press/Retreat
    (d) Closing could be done with an attack against opponent's weapon,
using weapon
          skill, to take it out of line, combined with a Press action
using ""Combat Maneuver"".
    (e) FEND as a combat option with a weapon- get a to-hit roll at big
plusses and
         at full press if  opponent is closing and has not taking weapon
off-line with
         an attack, feint, or active defense.

I am not so sure-- I think Jim's point is right on when he said we have
inflated our perception of skill mods due to the high level of out
characters.  (Even though he
then goes on to characterize his 90 PCF, RANK-12-Katana character as a
relatively
low level character!:-):-) Much to Mark's disgust and my amusement:-).

Chuck Lee is a match for Stephen Seagal.  He is a pro-Class A tournament
fighter.
He could be on his way towards become a world champion eventually.   I
was thinking
over Seagals films, and (ignoring military skills, etc) Chuck can easily
- and I mean EASILY- take on the opponents that Seagal takes on.  The
person who has the +28
due to secondaries is a GRAND MASTER and has the punching strength of a
world-
class bozer.  <shrug>

Look at fist, club, staff, sword, 2h sword:
FIST base damage: 2d4-1 -> 1-7-> 4 HTK ave.(4 SPD, 0 LGTH, +15 MOD)
CLUB base damage: 2d4+2 -> 4-10-> 7 HTK ave.(6 SPD, 1.5 LGTH, +10 MOD)
2H CLUB b.dam.: 2d6+2-> 4-14 -> 9 HTK ave.(12 SPD, 3 LGTH, +15 MOD)
STAFF base dam.: 2d6+4-> 6-16 -> 11 HTK ave. (10 SPD, 5 LGTH, +5 MOD)
SWORD b.d.: 2d6+4 SL->6-16-> 11 HTK ave.(10 SPD, 3 LGTH, -5 MOD)
2H SWORD b.d.:2d8+7->9-23-> 16 HTK ave.(20 SPD, 6 LGTH, -20 MOD)

Now the variables to this are strength, primary skills and secondary
skills:
Strength(6-18) gives STR-10 to this little mess.  So the range is from
about -4 to +8.
Skill(0-10) gives RANK-2.  So it gives -2 to +8
Secondaries(2 SEC and a GENERAL) give (RANK-2)/2.  So 0 to 12.

So the total range is around -6 to 28.

+ 28(18 STR, 3 RNK 10 secondaries, RNK 10 primary) would give 8* average
punch damage.  Okay I can be with that.  It would also give almost 3*
average two-handed sword damage.  Okay- given thewielder I can be with
that too.

This +28 guy would do 12 points more damage with a 2-handed sword as a
fist.   Again-
given who were talking about - getting your neck broken by Bolo, or cut
off by
Conan the Barbarian is much the same experience....:-)  and 2H sword
sdoes do a good chunk more damage.... 44 vs. 32! You will probaby be
125% wounded from the 2h sword and only 75% from the fist of fury.  AND
it is slicing rather than crushing but that is another matter...

However when laid out this way one thing becomes obvious doesn't it?
Secondaries give too much.  The secondaries -even all together should
not be as telling as the skill itself..
Wow!  Maybe we need to divide by three for secondaries?  That would make
the range 0 to 8.  Which would actually make strength, skill and
secondaries all equally weighted in terms of damage.

What do you guys think of that?

"RE: Weapon Damages","
I have a much better scenario:

Chuck approaches Broealis with the banana in hand.  Borealis cleverly   
suggests making a Daiquiri, and while his opponent considers the yummy   
beverage he turns and runs for his life.  After losing the opponent in   
the crowd, and disappearing off the face of the earth, he hacks into the   
bank and police records, destroy his opponent's credit rating and puts   
out an APB for his arrest.  All this from the comfort of his basement lab   
while wearing a pair of boxers, and basking in the glow of his CRT.  :-)

Someone, I'm not sure who in the flurry of emails, said the above.

To understand why Chuck is almost equally dangerous when armed with a
club, a fist or a mushy banana you have think about what he is going to
do with them in combat verses what a non-skilled combatant would do.
Let's assume for a moment that both combatants, skilled and non-skilled,
actually hit.  Now let's look at the effects:

                     Non-skilled Combatant (Borealis) Skilled Combatant

           therib cage, crushes internal
                     upper torso, arms or skull...some of organs and   
stunning the
                     the most heavily armored parts of the solerplexis   
nerve center,
                     human body) and does weapon damage       delivering   
nasty damage and   
                                                                        

                causing system shock

Fist hamburger attack #2 - Borealis' fist strikes    Chuck's knuckleshit   
the nose at
                    the jaw or chin bones, causing pain and  precisely   
the correct angle to

driving shards of
                    complications of tooth loss.  Borealis' cartilage up

                    knuckles are bruised, as well.    killing the   
opponent and,

                bleed

                 the banana)

Are you sure? Without looking at the math, having 3 skills at R10
equaling a +12 doesn't seem that out of line to me!!! 3 at R10 is a
pretty impressive thing. Right now, the damage is weighted the same as
the % to succeed- do you want to change that?

Spoken, of course, as a specialist. Rules changes that reduce the value
of secondaries benefit generalists as they cut specialists.

That is also in the rules in the section on Press and Retreat in Chapter
3: Combat.

If someone gets in under your weapon length you are at half chance and
half damage.  If they get in under half your weapon length it is quarter
chance and quarter damage.  Quite harsh!  I just looked at the write up-
sloppy and unclear.  I will have to file a DOC bug report on that
section!

You need to beat your opponent'a success number by 20 just to move 1
foot of combat
maneuver so once you get to a stage it is fairly easy to keep it unless
your opponnent is
a lot better than you and (s)he successfully retreats or fends you off.

Yes- If you can get to your stage(of press) before they are 1/3 through
with their swing they can no longer fend effectively.

Yes- but at half or quarter chance!

No- a world-class bozer.  It is a Bardic Tales character class that the

No- not really- it was a good idea while it lasted.  *SIGH*

Originally this post started with massive amounts of quoting everyone 
and replying to
everyone, and several jokes spinning off Mastication skills, Kyle's 
comparison of what
Chuck and Borealis would each do with various weapons, and Borealis 
thinking Chuck
to death.  However I am commtted to getting input form people so I will 
keepo this a medium size post in the interest of those who have limited 
bandwidth- because I value your input too!:-)
     
First off, weapon length/closing rules will be used more often  That 
will resolve many
of the issues.The rules include:
    (a) 1 WSD/foot difference to shorter weapon when at longer weapons
range
    (b) Retreat mods for shorter weapons when at longer weapon range(cum
with above)
    (c) ""Combat Maneuver"" skill allows for Press/Retreat
    (d) Closing could be done with an attack against opponent's weapon,
using weapon
          skill, to take it out of line, combined with a Press action
using ""Combat Maneuver"".
    (e) FEND as a combat option with a weapon- get a to-hit roll at big
plusses and
         at full press if  opponent is closing and has not taking weapon
off-line with
         an attack, feint, or active defense.

I am not so sure-- I think Jim's point is right on when he said we have 
inflated our perception of skill mods due to the high level of out 
characters.  (Even though he
then goes on to characterize his 90 PCF, RANK-12-Katana character as a 
relatively
low level character!:-):-) Much to Mark's disgust and my amusement:-).
     
Chuck Lee is a match for Stephen Seagal.  He is a pro-Class A tournament 
fighter.
He could be on his way towards become a world champion eventually.   I 
was thinking
over Seagals films, and (ignoring military skills, etc) Chuck can easily 
- and I mean EASILY- take on the opponents that Seagal takes on.  The 
person who has the +28
due to secondaries is a GRAND MASTER and has the punching strength of a 
world-
class bozer.  <shrug>
     
Look at fist, club, staff, sword, 2h sword:
FIST base damage: 2d4-1 -> 1-7-> 4 HTK ave.(4 SPD, 0 LGTH, +15 MOD) 
CLUB base damage: 2d4+2 -> 4-10-> 7 HTK ave.(6 SPD, 1.5 LGTH, +10 MOD) 
2H CLUB b.dam.: 2d6+2-> 4-14 -> 9 HTK ave.(12 SPD, 3 LGTH, +15 MOD) 
STAFF base dam.: 2d6+4-> 6-16 -> 11 HTK ave. (10 SPD, 5 LGTH, +5 MOD) 
SWORD b.d.: 2d6+4 SL->6-16-> 11 HTK ave.(10 SPD, 3 LGTH, -5 MOD)
2H SWORD b.d.:2d8+7->9-23-> 16 HTK ave.(20 SPD, 6 LGTH, -20 MOD)
     
Now the variables to this are strength, primary skills and secondary 
skills:
Strength(6-18) gives STR-10 to this little mess.  So the range is from 
about -4 to +8.
Skill(0-10) gives RANK-2.  So it gives -2 to +8
Secondaries(2 SEC and a GENERAL) give (RANK-2)/2.  So 0 to 12.
     
So the total range is around -6 to 28.
     
+ 28(18 STR, 3 RNK 10 secondaries, RNK 10 primary) would give 8* average 
punch damage.  Okay I can be with that.  It would also give almost 3* 
average two-handed sword damage.  Okay- given thewielder I can be with 
that too.
     
This +28 guy would do 12 points more damage with a 2-handed sword as a 
fist.   Again-
given who were talking about - getting your neck broken by Bolo, or cut 
off by
Conan the Barbarian is much the same experience....:-)  and 2H sword 
sdoes do a good chunk more damage.... 44 vs. 32! You will probaby be 
125% wounded from the 2h sword and only 75% from the fist of fury.  AND 
it is slicing rather than crushing but that is another matter...
     
However when laid out this way one thing becomes obvious doesn't it? 
Secondaries give too much.  The secondaries -even all together should 
not be as telling as the skill itself..
Wow!  Maybe we need to divide by three for secondaries?  That would make 
the range 0 to 8.  Which would actually make strength, skill and 
secondaries all equally weighted in terms of damage.
     
What do you guys think of that?

Consider a person with R10 Short Sword and R1 Long Sword. I think the
Secondary SHOULD overwhelm the Primary- or is there another rule
covering this?

Just in case I wasn't clear... Chuck is a high level martial artist.  I
have no problem with the fact that he could knock somebody out with a
single punch.  I have no with the fact that he could trash somebody with
low skill who was using a weapon.  BUT, I think that if Chuck, or any
very high level martial artist, squared off against an Escrimador of
equal skill, the Escrimador should have a _significant_ advantage.  Of
course, that advantage can be countered with good tactics, etc., but I
think the weapon itself should be an advantage at any level of skill
over having no weapon.

Below is the table Jim created to add in the effect of weapon length on
weapon speed.

There seems to be a consensus that weapon length rules, if enforced,
takes care of my original concern about fist being a faster way to drop
somebody that weapons.  However, this table assumes that the combat
range will be at the distance of the quarterstaff for the whole combat. 
If somebody with a short range weapon closes, the long weapon will be at
a disadvantage.  (No problem there, that's definately true).  The
problem is that if it is no easier to retreat than it is to press, then
a long weapon will be as likely to be a disadvantage as it is to be an
advantage.  That is why I really think it needs to either be very
difficult to close inside a weapon range or very easy to retreat back to
the longer weapon range.

> edge.

I like the idea of making combat movement a separate action, because
people will be less likely to use it unless there is a real tactical
advantage.  It would not really give an advantage to longer weapons
because as long as the first opponent spent an action and successfully
closed, the second opponent would have to spend an action to retreat
back to his effective range.  Or did you mean make press an action but
retreat free?  That would be a pretty simple mechanism, and would
certainly give the advantage to longer weapons.

At the risk of sounding like a broken record.  I still think even a club
does significantly more base damage than a punch, or probably even a
kick.  (And maybe even the dreaded Death Knee).  If somebody took a
punch at me I would be worried about a broken nose.  If somebody took a
swing at me with a club, I would worry about getting my skull caved in.

What level of skill does a brown belt or black belt have in BT? 
Straight rank 6's?  Straight 4's?  Lets be conservative.  With 4's in
punch, G:, and secondaries, a martial artist would be +5 from skill.  Do
you martial artists who were in that range think it would be easier to
break someone's arm with your skilled punch or with your unskilled club
swing?

I don't know how the number of joules of force was calculated, but if it
was just F=MA, that may be an oversimplification.  Fists, knees and feet
are compressable and will reabsorb some of the energy they impart.  A
solid wood or metal club will absorb much less of the energy, so more
will be transferred to the target.

I'm with Mark.  It is pretty impressive to rack up several 10's in one
area.  That person should be very effective.  My point was not that
people were too effective at these high levels, but that weapons should
be a higher proportion of the effect.

Geoff, as one of the above mentioned brown belts (who has no skill in
club), I have many thoughts on your question.  I'll try to capture them
all.

1) If my goal was to break the arm, and not just do general damage to
the opponent, then I would be more likely to succeed with karate than
with the club.  My precision is greater, so I good accept the ""real life
called-shot modifiers"" and still have a chance of success.

2) If my opponent was not armed and had no skill in combat (some hapless
low level villager waiting to be bludgeoned) and if my goal was to do
general damage to the opponent, then I think I would do more damage
faster with the club than with my fist or foot.  Note:  I not sure this
is true of inanimate objects.  I suspect I good kick a door open easier
(faster) than I could beat it open with a club.

3) If my opponent was armed or has skill in combat (so now I need to
worry about defending myself) and if my goal was to do general damage to
the opponent, then I would probably damage my opponent and preserve my
own health more effectively with a combination of karate and club.  I
would use  karate's precision until the opponent was stunned or
disarmed, then pummel him/her with the club.

4) To get to what I think you are really asking:  If I was striking my
opponent and they threw up their arm to fend off the blow (random strike
to any arm location), I would be more likely to break the arm if I were
attacking with a club than with my fist or foot.  

Just my opinion.  I hope this helps.

"BT: Weapons","Forget what I said about secondaries.  Secondaries are clearly (duck
under thrown fruit)
just FINE!(dodge tomato- or is that tomatoe? - Dan Quayle)

Also I withdraw any noise I was making about increasing WSDs they too
are just fine.

Secondaries should overwhelm the primary if they are sufficiently high.
At the current moment, if you had a general, and two secondaries, and
two tertiaries all at the same RANK as the primary they would JUST have
a little bit more effect all together than the
primary itself.  I.e. RANK 6 prim=60%; (6*3)*3+(6*1)*2=66%
I guess I don't have a problem with that!

I will send out another post on the scale of weapon damage versus the
modifiers in a moment.

Hey man- some profound thoughts arose from the banana thread.  Mock not
the yellow fruit lest ye be peeled...

I think it is.  All things being equal a standard wooden club's
averagedamage is almost double a fists.  If the club is a ""solid oak""
club it
probably has a +1 or +2 bonus due to material (another adavantage
of weapons- quality influenced damage and to-hit).  So in untrained
hands I have no question that the difference is sufficient.

However, the difference in raw damage does get washed out at higher
levels.  An Master Escrimador using a club versus Chuck would wash
out thye difference - three points would be as nothing!  I am not sure
I have a problem with that though- and the advantage still lies with the

Escrimadore.  Chuck's hand has 0 feet WPN LGTH.  The Escrimadore's
club is say 2 feet WPN LGTH.  That means that- with out closing- Chuck's

fist is an 8 count weapon (+2 for the difference in wpn length, and +2
for being
at a Stage 2 retreat.  Rememebr retreat rules and wpn length rules are
CUMULATIVE!) and he is at -2 DAMAGE and -20% to hit.
This means that if CHuck doesn't close he will be using a wepaon that
does 5
points  less damage and is 2 counts SLOWER, AND he will be at -20 to
hit!

I think that constitutes an advantage for the Master Escrimadore.  Of
course- if
Chuck does manage to close then the Escrimadore is unhappy....
Chances are that Chuck will have to attack the Excrimadores wepaon and
then
close because the Ecrimadore is likely to succeed with a fend...

It is difficult to close.  Pressing right now is a contest of skills- if
you winby 20% you close one foot.  If you win by 40% you close by two
feet.

It is difficult to close unless you are really good at it and your
opponent isn't.
I don't have a problem with closing being easy in a massive skill
disparity-
Reinhard (my Shotokan Karate instructor) was a bug for footwork and
stance!

Well- that is tricky.  The truth is there are two adavntages a club has
thataren't even modeled in BT really- damage taken from a strike, and
penetration
due to rigidity.  Ther ear eparts of the body where a hand and a club
would
feel much the same.  Captain Research surprised the shit out of me when
he
came up with a study that actually demonstrated the transfer of kinetic
energy
from a staff and a hand.  They were surprisingly the same, or very
similar.
However, and this is what BT doesn't model- you whale the heck out of a
club
and not take damage your self, while a handstrike needs to be calculated
and
targeted well if you aren't going to break all those little bones.  Now-
am I going
to model that?  No!  It is partially modeled by the fact that staff and
club do do
more damage than a hand (which they would anyway- greater moment arm and
all)
and partially not modeled.    As you start comparing dagger vs. sword
this doesn't
become as much of an issue.(sword=4+2d6=11 average, to
dagger=2d8-1=8 average ) and the sword has a 2 foot length advantage as
well.

Some argue that strength and skill make up most of the damage anyways
and
the weapon is merely a modifier.  GURPs models weapons this way.
Looking
at some of the data to be found it is arguable that a weapon is a wepaon
and length is actually the difference maker... <shrug>.  Bottom line:  I
think our method works well
enough.  And it is slightly unrelaistic in that some crushing blows with
rigid objects are more like chopping blows than crushing blows with
softer object, less rigid objects.
<shrug> .


> What level of skill does a brown belt or black belt have in BT?

Belt levels are way arbitrary- and I mean WAY- there are some styles
where a blck beltwould get wiped out in a seocnd by ANY of the brown
belts in our group- no matter
how out of shape, and some schools where a black belt is an Expert.
That being said:
Brown belt: RANK 4 in style, 4s in main attacks, 2s and 3s in support
skills, and maybe
a surprise advance skill between 1 and 3.  Black Belts - 2 ranks higher
in all.

To tell you the truth- an unheld arm is hard to break, I think even with
a club.  I think a club would be better gainst a held arm than a punch
but a hammerfist strike(the punch equivelant to a club swing) could
break an arm in a held position.  I can't imagine a non-rigid object
like a fist breaking an arm that wasn't secured.  (AND it would be
difficult to do with a club as well.  )

Exactly..... but remember- material mods will up the damage of a club-
iron isa +1 material! (ooohhhhhh...:-)

Bottom line:  Yea- in real life any rigid object swung in an arc will be
better
at breaking an arm than a hand.  I don't see an easy way to do that
though without
increasing weapon damages (which I am not willing to do unless I have
to) and I
think strength and skill is mor eimportnat than what you happen to be
swinging.

That is correct- a really fast close could be devastating to an opponent

Exactly.  It is a -20, -20  to-hit.  -20% to the close and -20% to the

Originally this post started with massive amounts of quoting everyone 
and replying to
everyone, and several jokes spinning off Mastication skills, Kyle's 
comparison of what
Chuck and Borealis would each do with various weapons, and Borealis 
thinking Chuck
to death.  However I am commtted to getting input form people so I will 
keepo this a medium size post in the interest of those who have limited 
bandwidth- because I value your input too!:-)
     
First off, weapon length/closing rules will be used more often  That 
will resolve many
of the issues.The rules include:
    (a) 1 WSD/foot difference to shorter weapon when at longer weapons
range
    (b) Retreat mods for shorter weapons when at longer weapon range(cum
with above)
    (c) ""Combat Maneuver"" skill allows for Press/Retreat
    (d) Closing could be done with an attack against opponent's weapon,
using weapon
          skill, to take it out of line, combined with a Press action
using ""Combat Maneuver"".
    (e) FEND as a combat option with a weapon- get a to-hit roll at big
plusses and
         at full press if  opponent is closing and has not taking weapon
off-line with
         an attack, feint, or active defense.

I am not so sure-- I think Jim's point is right on when he said we have 
inflated our perception of skill mods due to the high level of out 
characters.  (Even though he
then goes on to characterize his 90 PCF, RANK-12-Katana character as a 
relatively
low level character!:-):-) Much to Mark's disgust and my amusement:-).
     
Chuck Lee is a match for Stephen Seagal.  He is a pro-Class A tournament 
fighter.
He could be on his way towards become a world champion eventually.   I 
was thinking
over Seagals films, and (ignoring military skills, etc) Chuck can easily 
- and I mean EASILY- take on the opponents that Seagal takes on.  The 
person who has the +28
due to secondaries is a GRAND MASTER and has the punching strength of a 
world-
class bozer.  <shrug>
     
Look at fist, club, staff, sword, 2h sword:
FIST base damage: 2d4-1 -> 1-7-> 4 HTK ave.(4 SPD, 0 LGTH, +15 MOD) 
CLUB base damage: 2d4+2 -> 4-10-> 7 HTK ave.(6 SPD, 1.5 LGTH, +10 MOD) 
2H CLUB b.dam.: 2d6+2-> 4-14 -> 9 HTK ave.(12 SPD, 3 LGTH, +15 MOD) 
STAFF base dam.: 2d6+4-> 6-16 -> 11 HTK ave. (10 SPD, 5 LGTH, +5 MOD) 
SWORD b.d.: 2d6+4 SL->6-16-> 11 HTK ave.(10 SPD, 3 LGTH, -5 MOD)
2H SWORD b.d.:2d8+7->9-23-> 16 HTK ave.(20 SPD, 6 LGTH, -20 MOD)
     
Now the variables to this are strength, primary skills and secondary 
skills:
Strength(6-18) gives STR-10 to this little mess.  So the range is from 
about -4 to +8.
Skill(0-10) gives RANK-2.  So it gives -2 to +8
Secondaries(2 SEC and a GENERAL) give (RANK-2)/2.  So 0 to 12.
     
So the total range is around -6 to 28.
     
+ 28(18 STR, 3 RNK 10 secondaries, RNK 10 primary) would give 8* average 
punch damage.  Okay I can be with that.  It would also give almost 3* 
average two-handed sword damage.  Okay- given thewielder I can be with 
that too.
     
This +28 guy would do 12 points more damage with a 2-handed sword as a 
fist.   Again-
given who were talking about - getting your neck broken by Bolo, or cut 
off by
Conan the Barbarian is much the same experience....:-)  and 2H sword 
sdoes do a good chunk more damage.... 44 vs. 32! You will probaby be 
125% wounded from the 2h sword and only 75% from the fist of fury.  AND 
it is slicing rather than crushing but that is another matter...
     
However when laid out this way one thing becomes obvious doesn't it? 
Secondaries give too much.  The secondaries -even all together should 
not be as telling as the skill itself..
Wow!  Maybe we need to divide by three for secondaries?  That would make 
the range 0 to 8.  Which would actually make strength, skill and 
secondaries all equally weighted in terms of damage.
     
What do you guys think of that?

Consider a person with R10 Short Sword and R1 Long Sword. I think the
Secondary SHOULD overwhelm the Primary- or is there another rule
covering this?

Just in case I wasn't clear... Chuck is a high level martial artist.  I
have no problem with the fact that he could knock somebody out with a
single punch.  I have no with the fact that he could trash somebody with
low skill who was using a weapon.  BUT, I think that if Chuck, or any
very high level martial artist, squared off against an Escrimador of
equal skill, the Escrimador should have a _significant_ advantage.  Of
course, that advantage can be countered with good tactics, etc., but I
think the weapon itself should be an advantage at any level of skill
over having no weapon.

Below is the table Jim created to add in the effect of weapon length on
weapon speed.

There seems to be a consensus that weapon length rules, if enforced,
takes care of my original concern about fist being a faster way to drop
somebody that weapons.  However, this table assumes that the combat
range will be at the distance of the quarterstaff for the whole combat. 
If somebody with a short range weapon closes, the long weapon will be at
a disadvantage.  (No problem there, that's definately true).  The
problem is that if it is no easier to retreat than it is to press, then
a long weapon will be as likely to be a disadvantage as it is to be an
advantage.  That is why I really think it needs to either be very
difficult to close inside a weapon range or very easy to retreat back to
the longer weapon range.

> If closing were run as an action in and of itself then that, combined

> edge.

I like the idea of making combat movement a separate action, because
people will be less likely to use it unless there is a real tactical
advantage.  It would not really give an advantage to longer weapons
because as long as the first opponent spent an action and successfully
closed, the second opponent would have to spend an action to retreat
back to his effective range.  Or did you mean make press an action but
retreat free?  That would be a pretty simple mechanism, and would
certainly give the advantage to longer weapons.

At the risk of sounding like a broken record.  I still think even a club
does significantly more base damage than a punch, or probably even a
kick.  (And maybe even the dreaded Death Knee).  If somebody took a
punch at me I would be worried about a broken nose.  If somebody took a
swing at me with a club, I would worry about getting my skull caved in.

What level of skill does a brown belt or black belt have in BT? 
Straight rank 6's?  Straight 4's?  Lets be conservative.  With 4's in
punch, G:, and secondaries, a martial artist would be +5 from skill.  Do
you martial artists who were in that range think it would be easier to
break someone's arm with your skilled punch or with your unskilled club
swing?

I don't know how the number of joules of force was calculated, but if it
was just F=MA, that may be an oversimplification.  Fists, knees and feet
are compressable and will reabsorb some of the energy they impart.  A
solid wood or metal club will absorb much less of the energy, so more
will be transferred to the target.

I'm with Mark.  It is pretty impressive to rack up several 10's in one
area.  That person should be very effective.  My point was not that
people were too effective at these high levels, but that weapons should
be a higher proportion of the effect.

Geoff, as one of the above mentioned brown belts (who has no skill in
club), I have many thoughts on your question.  I'll try to capture them
all.

1) If my goal was to break the arm, and not just do general damage to
the opponent, then I would be more likely to succeed with karate than
with the club.  My precision is greater, so I good accept the ""real life
called-shot modifiers"" and still have a chance of success.

2) If my opponent was not armed and had no skill in combat (some hapless
low level villager waiting to be bludgeoned) and if my goal was to do
general damage to the opponent, then I think I would do more damage
faster with the club than with my fist or foot.  Note:  I not sure this
is true of inanimate objects.  I suspect I good kick a door open easier
(faster) than I could beat it open with a club.

3) If my opponent was armed or has skill in combat (so now I need to
worry about defending myself) and if my goal was to do general damage to
the opponent, then I would probably damage my opponent and preserve my
own health more effectively with a combination of karate and club.  I
would use  karate's precision until the opponent was stunned or
disarmed, then pummel him/her with the club.

4) To get to what I think you are really asking:  If I was striking my
opponent and they threw up their arm to fend off the blow (random strike
to any arm location), I would be more likely to break the arm if I were
attacking with a club than with my fist or foot.  

Just my opinion.  I hope this helps.

"BT: Weapons","Forget what I said about secondaries.  Secondaries are clearly (duck
under thrown fruit)
just FINE!(dodge tomato- or is that tomatoe? - Dan Quayle)

Also I withdraw any noise I was making about increasing WSDs they too
are just fine.

Secondaries should overwhelm the primary if they are sufficiently high.
At the current moment, if you had a general, and two secondaries, and
two tertiaries all at the same RANK as the primary they would JUST have
a little bit more effect all together than the
primary itself.  I.e. RANK 6 prim=60%; (6*3)*3+(6*1)*2=66%
I guess I don't have a problem with that!

I will send out another post on the scale of weapon damage versus the
modifiers in a moment.

Hey man- some profound thoughts arose from the banana thread.  Mock not
the yellow fruit lest ye be peeled...

I think it is.  All things being equal a standard wooden club's
averagedamage is almost double a fists.  If the club is a ""solid oak""
club it
probably has a +1 or +2 bonus due to material (another adavantage
of weapons- quality influenced damage and to-hit).  So in untrained
hands I have no question that the difference is sufficient.

However, the difference in raw damage does get washed out at higher
levels.  An Master Escrimador using a club versus Chuck would wash
out thye difference - three points would be as nothing!  I am not sure
I have a problem with that though- and the advantage still lies with the

Escrimadore.  Chuck's hand has 0 feet WPN LGTH.  The Escrimadore's
club is say 2 feet WPN LGTH.  That means that- with out closing- Chuck's

fist is an 8 count weapon (+2 for the difference in wpn length, and +2
for being
at a Stage 2 retreat.  Rememebr retreat rules and wpn length rules are
CUMULATIVE!) and he is at -2 DAMAGE and -20% to hit.
This means that if CHuck doesn't close he will be using a wepaon that
does 5
points  less damage and is 2 counts SLOWER, AND he will be at -20 to
hit!

I think that constitutes an advantage for the Master Escrimadore.  Of
course- if
Chuck does manage to close then the Escrimadore is unhappy....
Chances are that Chuck will have to attack the Excrimadores wepaon and
then
close because the Ecrimadore is likely to succeed with a fend...

It is difficult to close.  Pressing right now is a contest of skills- if
you winby 20% you close one foot.  If you win by 40% you close by two
feet.

It is difficult to close unless you are really good at it and your
opponent isn't.
I don't have a problem with closing being easy in a massive skill
disparity-
Reinhard (my Shotokan Karate instructor) was a bug for footwork and
stance!

Well- that is tricky.  The truth is there are two adavntages a club has
thataren't even modeled in BT really- damage taken from a strike, and
penetration
due to rigidity.  Ther ear eparts of the body where a hand and a club
would
feel much the same.  Captain Research surprised the shit out of me when
he
came up with a study that actually demonstrated the transfer of kinetic
energy
from a staff and a hand.  They were surprisingly the same, or very
similar.
However, and this is what BT doesn't model- you whale the heck out of a
club
and not take damage your self, while a handstrike needs to be calculated
and
targeted well if you aren't going to break all those little bones.  Now-
am I going
to model that?  No!  It is partially modeled by the fact that staff and
club do do
more damage than a hand (which they would anyway- greater moment arm and
all)
and partially not modeled.    As you start comparing dagger vs. sword
this doesn't
become as much of an issue.(sword=4+2d6=11 average, to
dagger=2d8-1=8 average ) and the sword has a 2 foot length advantage as
well.

Some argue that strength and skill make up most of the damage anyways
and
the weapon is merely a modifier.  GURPs models weapons this way.
Looking
at some of the data to be found it is arguable that a weapon is a wepaon
and length is actually the difference maker... <shrug>.  Bottom line:  I
think our method works well
enough.  And it is slightly unrelaistic in that some crushing blows with
rigid objects are more like chopping blows than crushing blows with
softer object, less rigid objects.
<shrug> .


> What level of skill does a brown belt or black belt have in BT?

Belt levels are way arbitrary- and I mean WAY- there are some styles
where a blck beltwould get wiped out in a seocnd by ANY of the brown
belts in our group- no matter
how out of shape, and some schools where a black belt is an Expert.
That being said:
Brown belt: RANK 4 in style, 4s in main attacks, 2s and 3s in support
skills, and maybe
a surprise advance skill between 1 and 3.  Black Belts - 2 ranks higher
in all.

To tell you the truth- an unheld arm is hard to break, I think even with
a club.  I think a club would be better gainst a held arm than a punch
but a hammerfist strike(the punch equivelant to a club swing) could
break an arm in a held position.  I can't imagine a non-rigid object
like a fist breaking an arm that wasn't secured.  (AND it would be
difficult to do with a club as well.  )

Exactly..... but remember- material mods will up the damage of a club-
iron isa +1 material! (ooohhhhhh...:-)

Bottom line:  Yea- in real life any rigid object swung in an arc will be
better
at breaking an arm than a hand.  I don't see an easy way to do that
though without
increasing weapon damages (which I am not willing to do unless I have
to) and I
think strength and skill is mor eimportnat than what you happen to be
swinging.

That is correct- a really fast close could be devastating to an opponent

Exactly.  It is a -20, -20  to-hit.  -20% to the close and -20% to the

The material (i.e. part of the body) you hit makes a big difference

Well, have you considered the possibility of dropping the NUMBER of 
secondaries?  Right now, if memory serves, it is possible to have five 
other skills (General, two secondaries, two tertiaries) adding to your 
skill in whatever you are trying to do.  This might seem a bit excessive 
to some.

I'v thought for a while you might consider doing something about the 
timing of combat.  Right now, it all seems to be over in less than five 
seconds, coincidentaly about the time a good mid-level mage is just 
getting ready to go to town.

The base standard for combat timing seems geared toward the ultra-fast 
high-level type (you know who you are, and put down that banana).  If, 
instead of splitting the average second into ten or twenty or a hundred 
pieces in a desperate attempt to let these monsters of mayhem still react 
in positive time, and in seperate pieces of it, there were some sort of 
simple precedence, and a larger combat 'tick', those of us with merely 
mortal reflexes might feel better.  Of course, we'd still get our butts 
kicked, but we might not feel like we were living in stasis.

Conversely, maybe a different approach to the same mechanics might do the 
same thing.. 

     GM: ""First second?""

     Bogey 1: ""I strike at .23, get a PCF Perception at .6, and strike 
again at .93""

     Bogey 2: ""I throw darts every .2 seconds.""

     Normal Human: ""I shoot him at .8, and start reloading.""

     Charlie Brown: ""I got a rock.""


Then again, perhaps my perceptions of 'normal' combats have been a tad 
skewed by my choice of companions.. I understand that some conflicts have 
taken place that do not involve major alterations in the landscape.


Anyway, just some thoughts on the whole process.

Well, I may be running the only low-mid level campaign right now. I
haven't noticed that CAGS runs all that fast- combats seem to take a

"Re: Weapons","Kyle, you made several interesting points.  I think your tendency to go
with karate rather than club in a fight is understandable since that is
where your package of skills is.  I would guess you might even choose to
fight unarmed rather than pick up a two handed sword in a fight, even
though I think it is clear that the sword would do much more damage if
you landed a solid blow.  You have more skill with unarmed combat, so
your accuracy would be much higher.  I think that is all reflected well
in the current BT system.

My comment is that I think damage from a club or other weapons is too
low _relative_ to unarmed techniques.  Kicking in a door is somewhat
different than doing damage to the door.  You can knock somebody pretty
far back with a push kick without hurting them much.  The same weapon
can deliver a snap kick which would cause more structural damage to the
target, but might not move it much.  I think clubs excel at the latter
type of damage being non-compressable fairly small striking areas
traveling at high velocity.  I believe all of those are key.  Even in
terms of knockback though, I don't think even the best martial artists
could knock a fly ball into the outfield with a punch, knee or even kick
although this is done by people of fairly low skill all the time with a
""two handed club"" which does only a couple points more damage.

I am clearly the only one who sees things this way though (or the only
one who likes a good debate to keep on it so long ;-) so I suppose I
will try to wrap up my part of this discussion.

I have learned several things about the BT system that I missed on the
web site that help keep the balance in the weapon system:

>From Alex:
> Chuck's hand has 0 feet WPN LGTH.  The Escrimadore's club is say
> 2 feet WPN LGTH.  That means that- with out closing- Chuck's fist

> wepaon that does 5 points  less damage and is 2 counts SLOWER, 
> AND he will be at -20 to hit!

So, if I understand, a weapon takes the following penalties:
  +1 speed per foot shorter, regardless of the combat range
  +1 speed per foot of retreat from optimal weapon range
  -1 point of damage per foot of retreat
  -10% to hit per foot of retreat
OK, the advantage of the club is very clear if the weapon wielder can
maintain his range.

> It is difficult to close.  Pressing right now is a contest of skills
> -if you win by 20% you close one foot.  If you win by 40% you close 
> by two feet.

This also sounds pretty good.  AND it is an action for the person
closing. right?  What about the person who is trying not to allow the
close?  Do they get a passive roll against their full skill chance?
Once the close is successful, how hard is it to retreat back to optimal
weapon distance?  (Is it an action?  Is it any easier than closing?)  

> It is difficult to close unless you are really good at 
> it and your opponent isn't.

Or lucky.  That's why I think it has to be easier to retreat than to
close.  One lucky closing roll and a pugilist would be all over an
escrimador for the rest of the fight if it is too hard to retreat.

> If the club is a ""solid oak"" club it
> probably has a +1 or +2 bonus due to material

If the weapon damages are based on the poorest quality of material and
get plusses to damage for being solid wood or metal (in the case of
clubs) I can buy the closeness in damage of hand v. club.

I think if all these rules can be remembered and used

Having dropped the weapon damage discussion, I thought I would pick this
one up.

I agree that combat happens much too quickly in BT (and all ""real time""
systems I have come across).  The idea of rounds in D&D is explained
somewhere as the time it takes for a good target to open up, but that
mechanism obviously causes another series of problems itself.

Most players I have seen, even in systems that reward tactics, default
to swing-swing-swing-swing.  Because of woundedness mods, it is usually
advantageous to rack up as much damage on your opponent as quickly as
you can.  The advantage of defending yourself is not significant enough
(or at least it does not appear that way to many players) for them to
change tactics.

For the sake of game theory discussion, here are a couple rough ideas on
how to maybe model hand to hand combat more realistically:

1) Use a mechanism that would allow people to create/find targets as a
function of skill.  A rank 1 puncher could, say, find one target every
10 seconds while a rank 8 puncher could find 8 targets.  Feint, combat
perception and combat movement could be used to increase the number of
targets per unit time while defense could be used to decrease them.

OR

2) Make defense much more powerful so that it is very difficult to score
a solid hit on someone without catching them reacting.  Then people
might wait for the other guy to strike first in order to catch him
reacting.  Of course feint and maybe combat movement could be altered to
make them more important in drawing out that first punch or unnecessary
block.  This could also explain why black belts tend to spend so much
time with footwork and feinting--since they react so quickly they have
to wait until their opponent really botches a reaction roll to give them
time to strike while he is reacting.  It would also explain why
competant black belts often get beat up when they get jumped from
surprise.

Actually, #2 wouldn't be that much of a change for my system or BT (I am
not familiar enough with SH to say).  The drawback is that it would
force those people who just want fast combat to get tactical.","Geoffrey Hodge","ghodge@mail.ziplink.net","SMTP","Jim Jackl-Mochel","jmochel@foliage.com","SMTP","'Jim Smith';Geoffrey Hodge;Jim Wilson;Joe Lapolito;Kyle Hall;Lara Jackl;Mark Desmarais;Ron Severson;Morphus;Lisa Hodge;Alexander Jackl","JS_Myth@compuserve.com;ghodge@ziplink.net;jaw@foliage.com;jml@ziplink.net;Kyle.Hall@PSS.Boeing.com;Lara_Jackl@hphc.org;MDesMarais@pixelvision.com;Ron_Severson_at_CAM2@abtassoc.com;morphus@utopia.com;lhodge@ziplink.net;ajackl@avs.com","SMTP;SMTP;SMTP;SMTP;SMTP;SMTP;SMTP;SMTP;SMTP;SMTP;SMTP",,,,,,"Normal",,"Normal"

It may seem excessive but I like the dynamic and it doesn't cost that
much.People who really hate it don't calculate it and take the hit in
their chance to hit.
It gives more ""reality"" to skill interaction.  I personally (opinion
-can't prove this)
feel we are more the sum of our skills than we are a primary skill that
is helped
by others.

God - I would love to come up with an easy model to slow down combats.
I haveconsidered(with the new speed rules) doubling all WSDs.  All of
them.  A fist would be 8 counts(1.8 seconds), a long sword would be
twenty counts(4 seconds).  These lengths are long but it is much easier
to compress wsd now (5% to-hit, 1 point of damage, etc.)
that people who are good would be able to speed up the process resonable
fast and people who are not would take a long time to find their target.

I personally would move ahead with this SIMPLe solution but people seem
not to like it.

Not at all- as a matte rof fact that is the problem.  It is based on Joe
Average, and whatyou are seeing is the high-level people distorting the
system at the far end.

I agree see above about doubling weapon speeds.

Absolutely- the party you run with are so high level that one person in
our party is about to become a Lesser God- with an almost 200 SCF.   You
expect that person to react blindingly fast.  Even the mighty Arak JUST
broke a 100 PCF.  These people are masters and they are over the top.

Mark is running the only mid-level campaign in town besides Lara- and at
that level combat works JUST FINE(TM).  As Mark says - as people get
into RANK 8s in their skills they start to become frighteningly fast -
but that is appropriate- they are VERY EXPERT, one of the best in a
Large City.:-)   And remember- people like CHuck, Mordnaith, and Steven
have skills in their areas in the 10 range.

The gun fights in which people are NOT wearing body armort on those
tapes are
VERY fast.  They are over in seconds.  People go ""hey he's got a -BANG!
BANG-BANG-BANG"" and then someone falls over or sucessfully runs away.
We are
talking less than 7 secondes tops! The extended ones are the ones where
people are
lumped in Body armor and trading shots form cover.  A BT gun fight would
take a
while there too...

HTH sparring matches also don't take into account being hurt.  However-
all this being said- it isn't reailstic how fast it goes because that
""flinch/caution"" reflex isn't modelled, AND the extend wepaon-
perceive-draw back-start parry- start attack process isn't modelled and
that is time consuming.

I also need to be rigorous about making people make new perception rolls
if they change targets or major actions.  In real life you don't just
duck the knife, turn and shoot 2
rounds into someone, dive down the stairs and pick the lock in one
continuous stream of
action- you sytop and asses and make perception rolls.  I may be too lax
with passive perception rolls, kick-back recovery, and
movement....<shrug>

Yep.... although parrying is so easy, and so much faster that if they
only knew.  AND it
adds +4 to your oppnenet's next reaction, and they break any pre-sets
they might have
had.  It is amazing effective.  But you rae right- people default to
swing-swing-swing.

This is a great, but I think, unworkable idea.
I toyed with people having to make a successful PCF perception roll to
find a
target, but it added a lot more rolls.

Theother thing is that if you look at Fencing, SCA-fighting, or
cinematically at  battle scenes like the ones in Braveheart- those are
all laser fast combats.  It may be that we are lured into thinking
combats should be slow by watching martial arts sparring.

It is a good idea though.  I think any solution would have to be simple-
like doubling wepaon speeds na dsaying finding opening is in
there...<shrug>

OR

People who are good at defense though will be IMPOSSIBLE to hit for
low-level people- it will be an even weirder model than the fast combats
we have been seeing.
It is already the case that some people are untouschable- anyone with a
defense over 60 can nullify any low-level character's attack WITHOUT
actively defending!!!!!

I think we are there already.  The problem lies in the range of attack
chances- people
who are really good can get attack chance sin the 300% range.  That
impossible to
defeat 60 defense becomes trifling at that range.  <shrug>

More to think about- thanks all of you for your input.

A baseball bat swung(fam:+30) while not defending[usually](+30) into a
pre-setnon-defending area [the ""in"" box which is about a standard target
size](+60),
doing a called shot:small(-90) on a fast moving target[90 mph or so] but
moving
towards the batter(-30 + -150=-180/2=-90) is a -60% action AND a
2H club does: 2+2d6 CR damage- so an average of 9 points.  That is over
double the average damage of a fist and two points higher than it's max
damage. I owuld also assert that a bat is optimized for  ""whacking"" and
is made of a good material- I would give a
bat +2 mods.  That makes it's average damage 11 points.  I don't know-
skill and strnegth being equal a bat is a notable improvement over a
fist.  It is definitley the more effective damage doer.  And breaking
things is a function of how many points you can
do in one strike.  Otherwise it is just damage ticks.   <shrug>

:-)  We are all against you.  Actually- I see your point and agree it is
an area wherereality and BT don't interface very smoothly, but I think
the reality is more complex than
our ""common sense"" tells us, and there is contradictory evidence as to
what does more
damage and how much and how come so I see no easy resolution to even get
at what
exactly is the truth- never moind how to make it playable.  So that is
why I am so willing
to not start fooling with this.

Not the poorest quality- but not at all the best or even good.  It is
whatever is standard.And I lean towards the bottom for the standard. I
owuld run a stick as a no material
mod club.   So any manufactures clubn will get a +1 right of the bat,
and then if it is oak or stell, etc.  The base for metal weapons is
iron.   You have to sort of guess which wepaons I think should be metal
wepaons(maces and swords and piercing points mostly!):-)

I agree.  I also think if I remember the rules- wait- you meant...:-)

I need to put that stuff in the WEBsite.

Here are a few things that I noticed when upgrading Sigmund to use the formulas on the web page.  They may or may not be issues, it is hard for me to tell:

1.	In the description of the MVM secondary stat the formula reads:

MVM = (AGL*2 + STR - BLD -30)/10 + ...

This is different than everywhere else where a character with all 10's gets a stat contribution of zero instead of -1.  Should the subtracted number be a 20 or is Joe normal supposed to have move of 3.5 (5'10"",155#)?

2.	Saves have changed a lot:

It seems odd that the strength save would be based on PCF as a factor.  I know the save skill is a PCF skill and that seems fine but I like the old system in which the save was baed on STM instead of PCF.  It seems out of character for all styles of fighters (including an expert fencer) to have a high save.  I suppose it was worse before in that a sage would get a contribution for his scholarly knowledge but since the STM was never as large as a characters primary factor this did not seem as unbalancing.

On the other side of the scale, since Sigmund is a high level generalist, the new save formulas caused half of his saves to drop dramatically.  For any save in which he previously used STM because it was higher than his factor he now uses PLF or MLF.  Since he is a generalist each of these are about one half of his TLF and so half his saves dropped from around a 100 to around a 60 (he has a 40 TLF so splitting it in half loses a contribution of 20*2 = 40).  This may be intentional but it was a rather dramatic change.

3.	I did not understand the damage column on the weapons table.  I think I missed a discussion somewhere.

Actually, those were the only questions I had so far.  It seemed like more, but then I haven't read through a lot of the stuff which is not directly relevant to my spreadsheet.

On a completely different note, I was calculating how Sigmund would fair as a long distance runner since this is the current ability upon which my shift through the net spell is based.

Sigmund has a disgustingly high PEND (362)
Sigmund has a normal MVM(6, 7 if active) for an active person

According to the current rules and assuming movement is activated for long distance running:

Sigmund can jog at ~14 mph for up to 15 hours before reaching 50% exhaustion
Sigmund can run at ~21 mph for up to 3 hours before reaching 50% exhaustion

A record breaking boston marathon runner runs 27 miles in 2 hours or runs at ~14 mph for 2 hours and probably ends up 75% to 100% exhausted.  From this we could assume that:

	They have an active move of 14 and 2 PEND and are walking
	They have an active move of 7 and 24 PEND and are jogging
	They have an active move of 5 and 120 PEND and are running

I suspect it is the middle case.  It may be that they have 48 PEND (is this alot) and are ending the race 50% exhausted and I am just underestimating how dramatic that can be.  Marathon runners often puke for a while after a good race or fall unconcious.

Just a random thought.

AND:

Actually, that whole thing I did with the marathon made me realize I am
not sure if I like
the way endurance is modelled.  As I understand it a he-rock like
Sigmund who has been
training in endurance for years and has 10x as much as the average Joe
can therefor do 10x
as many things before getting tired.  It will, however, take him 10x
longer to recover.
Furthermore, if Sigmund and Joe average do the same amount of stuff they
will accumulate the
same amount of PEX.  It will matter less to Sigmund but it will still
take him the same
amount of time as untrained Joe to recover it.  Does this model reality?

BTW:  Sigmund could finish the boston marathon in 60 minutes by running
the whole thing at a
breaking run and finish with 50% of his PEX remaining.  If he ran it at
a dash he would drop
to 0 PEX after ~36 minutes with 6 miles to go.

I'm with Jim, here.  If the stats are truly average, then the 
bonuses/penalties from them should be zero.

I agree as well.  I know Strength is the stat for PCF, but I don't think 
PCF is necessarily the factor for Strength.

Actually, I think it's even worse.  I would peg the record-breaking 
marathoner as 150% exhausted, or even more, at least as Alex has been 
running it.  (In which case ""Willpower"" and ""KIF Trance"" are valued 
marathoner skills.)

Perhaps this should model more like PEND.

I do not know if it is what you are looking for but it appears that you do not
choose your weight.  Instead you choose your height, your base weight is 
calculated based on your height, strength and build, and then you can
choose a weight differential (which is supposedly a balanced stat).  It
appears that build effects your weight by +/- 3% per point so the major
determining factor of weight is height.

I like the elbow in skill ranks.  It gives people a chance to get to reasonable 
working values but then makes advance at the higher end very difficult.  I
personally think that once you get up around ten in a skill you should be 
getting more of your growth from breadth (related/support skills) rather than

"Re: BT: Endurance","     It seems to me that Alex and Pookie are discussing two different 
     things.  One is Endurance, the other is Recovery.  
     
     I think Pookie's observation that Endurance is related to Skill is 
     completely accurate and intuitively obvious.  Someone who is in great 
     shape, but has never ridden a horse, will not endure as long as a 
     trained rider - even if the rider is generally out of shape.  The 
     rider's training has built 'extra' endurance in the specific group of 
     muscles that riding requires.  
     
     That addresses the first half of the equation:  Namely, ""How soon does 
     one get exhausted?""  I think that this aspect can be easily 
     incorporated into the present system by increasing Endurance 
     proportionally to your Skill.  
     
     However, the second half of the equation, then, is:  ""Once you are 
     exhausted, how long does it take to recover?""  I am not an expert in 
     the field of physical exhaustion; the research I have done is in the 
     area of sleep deprivation.  Some of what is relevent there may apply 
     here.  
     
     In the area of sleep, we can distinguish three major states:  active 
     (awake), resting (maintain), and sleep (recovery).  It occurs for most 
     people that there is a certain amount of 'required' sleep necessary, 
     regardless of the amount of rest.  Staying Active beyond this required 
     amount builds up a 'sleep deficit'.  Resting does not increase the 
     sleep deficit, but it doesn't relieve it, either.  
     
     Staying Active while sleep deprived is possible, but comes with a cost 
     above and beyond the extra recovery time.  I guess you would say it 
     degrades Mental Awareness, Mental Agility, Physical Agility (and 
     perhaps others).  Even so, at some point, the body will refuse to stay 
     active, and essentially will knock you out to go into recovery.  
     
     The important part here is:  that once the body goes into recovery 
     (sleep), it tends to stay there until the job is done (the deficit has 
     been paid for).  This is so even if we are experientially unaware of 
     our level of deprivation.  In sleep trials using rooms without time 
     cues, normal, everyday Americans sleep, on average, 12 hours their 
     first night of the study (afterwards scaling back to about 8 
     hours/night).  
     
     What I think is most important to model here, is the folk wisdom - ""I 
     wasn't tired until I set down a spell.""  I don't think it's so 
     important to decide how long before you're 'back to normal' - I think 
     it's important to decide how long you are incapacitated during 
     recovery.  And I do mean incapacitated.  If someone has not run in a 
     long while, and then they decide to run 3 or 4 miles, their body may 
     support them at the time.  But the next day, they will hardly be able 
     to walk.  
     
     If it were my task to model this phenomenon, instead of modeling 
     Extreme Exhaustion, as it were, I'd model in Deprivation as negative 
     Endurance (0 would be 'exhausted').  This would mean that someone with 
     a high level of Endurance in a particular skill would take longer to 
     go 'negative' - before they take hits to their MAW,MDX,PDX, etc. - but 
     that they'd still have to take the time being incapacitated when they 
     eventually went into recovery (slept).  
     
     Oh, well, that's my take on the matter.

"RE: Endurance","Just a few notes to put the situation in mis-perspective.

Let us compare Joe Normal Amateur Athlete with Sigmund the Fortu:

Joe Normal	15's in all physical stats / what a hunk
		At least 10 in all physical factors (because of the 15 stats)
		A 20 AGF and 20 KIF because he is an Athlete
		Assume some of his KIF comes from a Rank 7 PEND Skill
		Joe is actually a bit above average

Sigmund	18 STR, 13 AGL, 15 CON, 15 DEX - Pretty much the same as Joe
		Very high physical factors including a 110 KIF and a 35 AGF
		A rank 7 PEND Skill

Joe has a 97.5 PEND based on stats and 52.5 from skill giving a total of
	150 PEND	~34% from skill.

Sigmund has a 367 PEND based on stats and 60 from skill giving a total of
	427 PEND	~14% from skill

Let us use the example of Dashing (10PEX/min) and ignore meta-exhaustion
for now:

Joe can dash for 15 min straight before dropping exhausted
	assuming Joe is fast (8MVM=2400'/min=27mph) he runs 6.8 miles
	sounds good so far
Sigmund can dash for 43 min straight before dropping exhausted
	since Sigmund is not as fast (6MVM=1800'/min=20mph) he runs 14.5 miles
	works for me, both these numbers are a bit large for a dash but
	since both Joe and I are conditioned athletes and it is a fantasy
	campaign I will buy it.

Joe, being a human, gets about (2+4+8+8+4*8) 54 PEX back for a normal
eight hour night of sleep.  As I understand it you can't get value for more
than eight hours of sleep in a night but I was fuzzy on that.  Joe recovers
from his Marathon run in three days.  Seems a little long but what the heck.

Sigmund, being a fortu, gets about (8*8) 64 PEX back for an abnormally long
eight hours of shutdown (normally he shuts down for 4 hours a night).  I am
assuming the same eight hour limit applies.  Sigmund recovers from his
marathon run in 6.6 days.

Sounds like apples and oranges at the moment.  Well look at it this way, which
is a much more common usage.  Both Joe and Sigmund were running the
Boston Marathon (27.5 miles) and both of them were doing it by dashing as
fast as they could for short distances and then jogging until they catch there
breath and then dashing again.  Stupid but it serves to make the point.  We
will ignore the PEX cost of jogging since it is small compared to that of dashing.

Joe dashes for 6.8 miles of the race and jogs the remaining 20.7 miles at a
rate of 10.8mph for a total time of 130 minutes or 2:10.  A decent time even
though I bet he could have made it faster if he just kept up a RUN all the way
without slowing (he would then do it in 1:41 which is a course record).

Sigmund dashes for 14.5 miles of the race and jogs the remaining 13.0 miles
at a rate of 8.0mph for a total time of 140 minutes or 2:20.  Hey, I lost, that
sucks.  I guess when running a marathon MVM is more important than PEND.

Anyway, now it is plain that we both ran the same race, we both are exhausted,
and Sigmund takes more than twice as long to recover.  Of course based on the
fact that we both finished in about the same time I could conclude that in this
example BT has demonstrated how skill is more important to long-term performance
than PEND is.  The tricky thing in this example is that Sigmund probably has a higher
Movement skill than Joe average athlete but the athlete is taller and therefor has a
better MVM.

Conclusions:

Perhaps the current system is not so bad if we make sure to measure EFFECT vs.
endurance expenditure.  For Movement skill, this means you get more distance
covered per minute of running and therefor you need to use less endurance at
higher ranks.  The other example that comes to mind is that you kill things faster
in combat when you are higher rank and therefor you use less END.

Is it a general maxim that when you are high level you need to perform less of a
given action to accomplish the same result.  Can you think of supporting examples,
counter examples?

If this is true what it calls for is a change in GMing style.  I noticed that in the recent
hearstone ritual run (in which we spent a lot of time tramping through the wilderness
and climbing cliffs) everyone got charged the same amount of PEND regardless of
their rank in Movement or Climbing or Outdoorsmanship.  Should this change rather
than making a universal system change?

"Endurance"," 
Hello everyone,

I think Pookie's conclusion pretty much reflect my views. I would 
however like to make a few comments 
about use of skills.  It seems to me from watching the high exaustion 
events from the last 
Olympics that contestants had some control over the effect of their 
skill rolls, at times they concentrated 
on ( this is all speculation of course ) maintaining a nearly 
effortless flowing motion conserving endurance, while at other times 
the effect of their skill was in increasing the effectiveness (speed) 
of whatever it was they were doing.

Is it possible to translate this easily into the system?  What about 
when a party is walking together down 
the road with movements of 6, 7 and 8.  Could the higher movement 
characters get an 'endurance 
discount' if they adjust their pace to match the slowest?  Perhaps by 
multiplying the endurance cost by 
6/7 or 6/8 respectively.  In this way the slow character might 
accumulate 50 EXT points while the 
others would each pick up 43 and 38 respectively.

I'm not comfortable with how Jim calculated the exhaustion for the 
marathon runners, Is the endurance use rate for dashing higher than 
the recovery rate?  If it is did you remember to subtract the 
exaustion points from the runners endurance before he dashed agained? 
 If not, could the runner really dash for 6.8 straight miles?  If he 
did that he would have major modifyiers to his remaining jog.

Anyway, its late so goodnight all.

Peter

That is actually what BT tries to model by hooking factors into the END 
stat. SH does not try to model this yet simply because
I could find no really playable and balanced model. I simply set PFT to a 
manageable number and let recovery take place quickly and
try to watch the meta-exhaustion.
...

To which I reply:
I do not think that adding the factors in to the END stat sufficiently models
the reduced effect of endurence for having high rank in a skill.  In the 
example of a marathon runner trying to cross country ski  for the first time
they would still be both AGF skills.  In fact the athletes high AGF would
contribute to any physical action in that way. Mind you I think we should
still keep factor contributions but I think that we should look at how 
endurence cost is reduced specifically related to high rank in an
individual skill.

I said TRIES to model. :-)
     
It is difficult to do correctly. I have seriously thought about doing something 
along these lines:
     
If a character has a rank of twice the energy cost of an action then they don't 
expend any PFT to 
do that action , just exhaustion (PEX). That does model most of what needs to be
modeled 
but the bookkeeping is annoying.
     
The same could be done for BT but I think the END and MEN numbers would have to 
be trimmed back
drastically.

"Re[4]: BT: Endurance","     Um... Exactly my point.  From my limited experience in play, one would 
     not normally worry about endurance or action costs.  I was 
     recommending the option of giving a player the possibility of 
     modifying the cost of the action based on skill level, if the player 
     wanted to do the calucations and throw the skill mods into the mix.  
     
     For the record, I was not advocating keeping track of separate 
     endurance skill pools for each skill (yuck!).

Book keeping nightmare- now I have separate endurance values for every 
skill. Simpler to modify the cost rather than the pool, but still a pain 
in the balls. 
     
As another data point in Pookies Xcountry ski model, I  am pretty much 
fully recovered today- I have a little residual soreness, but would not 
hesitate to go out and do the same trip again. My Xcountry skills have 
gone unused for about 15 years, but I was probably about a R2-3. I have 
good downhill skills, and am in decent shape, but not exercising on a 
regular basis.
     
I am worried that we are getting cumbersome. How about this for a 
compromise?
     
--- Leave costs and expenditures of END as they are. 
--- Ditch all the metas.
--- Recover endurance in a manner similar to concussive HTK- in 25% 
increments, seconds, minutes, hours, days.
--- Allow characters to reduce action costs by rolling against their 
skills IF THEY WANT/NEED TO. So normally you just crank along ignoring 
this whole rule set (status quo ;-). But if you are doing a marathon 
guitar playing session, or attempting to chase down a party of Orcs who 
have swiped your halfling cook, etc etc etc, then it becomes worth your 
while to make an expenditure reduction roll.
     
     
What do you think??? This is all off the top of my head- I haven't run 
any numbers to see what this would do, or what impact it might have on 
training. But gut feel, I think it would work......

"BT: Setup (failure announcement)","Well- one of the big changes in BT revision 6.0 was that set-up and

One negative initiative point or SPDpoint will buy you:  1 SPD point or
2%-to-hit or 2 counts of a passive action (perception, support skill

Why 2 counts? why not leave it at 1 to 1 spd/cts? Also, do you still
need to activate generals? I thought that concept was dead.

Is there a way to convert SPD directly into extra damage?

"RE: Setup (failure announcement)","I agree.  When I was calculating the heartstone ritual percentages for
people and I switched from 2% to 5% it just became too disgusting.

Some notes on your comments however:

>Set-up in real counts will give you 5% per count and is limited to:

I know the basic idea is that a bonus like setup cannot count for more
than your basic chance in the skill.  The trick is the definition of basic chance.
One of the key things is that the difficulty modifier/sorcery mod has been
included in basic chance in the past.  Thus if I have an SCF of 20 and a
plane shift of 6.0 (S:Plane Shift used to have a -60 mod, I don't know if
it still does)  my base chance is 20, not 80 and the most I can set-up is
4 counts instead of 16.  Also I have assumed that secondaries and generals
are part of your base chance.  In fact I have assumed that your base
chance is all non-situational modifiers.

Also, ditto on marks question about buying extra damage with negative speed.

Hmmmm..... I was about to blindly justify it using the ""but it has always
been that way rule"" .  Actually with the increase in SPD points given by the
splitting reaction/action it makes sense to do it one for one.

DONE!    Make that 1 for 1 for passive actions.  So 8 SPD points will buy
you a full passive perception or general skill activation.

>Also, do you still

Not most of them- however some have it in their skill descriptions that they
need to be activated.  Wizardries, for instance- you need to ""draw the
symbols to you"" to use the general skill.
>
>Is there a way to convert SPD directly into extra damage?

I have done some number crunching and am considering a 1 point of damage for
each SPD but I am not sure. I am worries about throwing too much change in
too fast.  Notice these changes are pretty much a back slide.

What do you mean!?:-);-)*grin*

Also- while I am at it...

ON SUPPORT SKILLS:

You no longer need to roll against support skills.  No, let me say it
different- you may no longer roll against support skills.  They give their
3% per rank or 1 SPD point per rank and that is it.  This change alleviates
two problems:

People getting insanely-high bonuses because they are criticalling their
support skill rolls.  This is often because of level factor and other
bonuses that already give to the primary skill so it is redundant bonuses.

It reduces the number of rolls people have to make in play.  You r
quickstrike just adds Rank in SPD points to your action.  Period!  Your
florentine gives you 3% per rank- period.  No need to do another roll- no
need to recalculate for levels of success, etc.

This is a blessing for people with low ranks because it means you don't fail
your roll either- you always get 6% for your rank 2 support skill!:-)

God this is looking like a point revision isn't it.  Shit.  Okay.  I will
send out a single change-post with the revisions once I have heard more
comments on set-up, this change, and endurance.  It may take a while for
endurance to get resolved but we will see.   Revision 6.1 here we
come.....:-)  Any other changes people think are ESSENTIAL?*LOL*

Well, if you apply the same rules as for to hit, I think you come out at
2/5 of a point of damage for a SPD. So to round to something reasonable,
2 SPD buys you 1 DAM. ( This retains that illogical game-balance thingie
ratio something or other)

Hurray!!!  I heartily endorse this change mostly because I didn't know that you could do it

Sigmund would have become had I applied this.  This would also explain the speed of
certain characters (specifically Menahan) which I have never been able to understand

"BT: Endurance questions","This post responds up to Pookie's post of January 6th, 12:25 pm.

I am not going to try to copy people's texts.  I am going to try to be as
brief as possible- I don't have time and neither I am sure, do you!  So.....

First off- what Jim said about the studies of endurance.  BT is designed to
reflect that:
END(endurance) = oxygen intake energy, comes back within minutes....
EXT(exhaustion) = other supplies of energy, reserves, comes back in hours
and days, requires rest
MEXT(meta-exhaustion) = body damage, depleting the body for energy, comes
back in days, requires rest

I am not going to get rid of EXT and MEXT as per Mark's suggestion because
they are game balancers.  However, most of the time character's don't have
to worry about them.

I agree with people that- and it seems unanimous that it is true:-) - that
the ENDURANCE pools go up much slower than the way we model and rank in
skill allows the user to be more and more efficient at the skill.  I just
haven't come up with a playable model.  Pools that grow with Level factors
is easy.  Any brilliant ideas?

Pook wrote:
>Let us use the example of Dashing (10PEX/min) and ignore meta-exhaustion
>for now:

It is important to remember that although as a short hand we talk about
walking taking 6 EXT per hour, it really takes 1 END a minute, and DASHING
takes 1 END every 3 counts.  This is important because I don't think Sigmund
can actually DASH for 43 minutes straight.    Sigmund would run out of END
in about 4 minutes- and then have to rest to recover.  In two or three
minutes he could start again.  END is always the first thing.

>Joe, being a human, gets about (2+4+8+8+4*8) 54 PEX back for a normal

>than eight hours of sleep in a night but I was fuzzy on that

You can sleep as long as you want.   I have occasionally used GM fiat to
dictate that you can't sleep for 24 hours ""because you are not tired
anymore"" (mostly mages trying to do the cast everything for ten minutes,
sleep for ten hours, cast everything for ten minutes rule abuse...:-)).

Your first hour of sleep is light sleep and gives you 2 EXT, 0 MEXT
Your second hour of sleep is medium sleep and gives you 4 EXT, 0 MEXT
All following hours of sleep are deep sleep and give you 8 EXT, 0.5 MEXT

I agree with Peter and Mark and others  that character's should be able to
""save"" endurance by matching the slower members of the party, etc. AND
choose whether they are saving energy or going for ""speed"".   My only
question- is there a simply way to model that without excessive bookkeeping?

IN RESPONSE to POOK's suggestion:

We cannot ditch Meta-exhaustion.  However I can kick it up to the design
level and only trot it out to reign in characters that are trying to not
sleep for two months or something......

I don't like using the HTK rules because of the fact that there are more
variables in endurance recovery like rest.....
Also having it be three pools makes it easy to track- you don't have to know
which day you are on or how many you have already healed in this category,
etc.  You know what you have to do to recover  a MEXT, EXT or an END.  AND
the mechanism of EXT coming off the top of end models what seems to happen
in real life nicely.    I.e. you recover to an extant, and then use a bunch
of endurance, recover to a slightly lesser extant, use a bunch of endurance
etc.....

I also like Pookie's formula/chart for using crits to reduce endurance cost.
I have no problem with that except I would modify it as I mention in my
earlier post:

> Levels Of Critical Endurance

> 0 x2/3
> 1 x1/2
> 2 x2/5
> 3 x1/3
> 4 x2/7
> 5 x1/4
> ...


Okay folks- go wild- tell me what you think.....

Way to low.  In my post with the 6.1 changes I include some new Meta-EXT
recovery rates:

.5 per hour of deep sleep.
.25 per hour of complete rest

Ummm..... they happen simultaneously and independant of each other.  So any
recovery numbers we bandy about are for BOTH Physical and Mental versions,
and they occur simo- so in the first hour of sleep you recover 2 physical
exhaustion and two mental exhaustion.

That isn't bad.  It is simple and you would have to deal with it except in
the rare case where the player wants it and then it would be a big deal to
determine the ratio.

DONE!

Do not include secondaries or generals in set-up base chance and do not
include the difficulty of the skill.  ONly include RANK*10 + LVF.  This is
because the more difficult actions are where set-up is really needed and IMO
makes the most difference in real-life.

Yes- I will probably take the suggestion of 2 SPD = DAM and use it.

What is on the table in Rev 6.1 with support skills is that you do not roll
against them.

Currently however you are able to exceed the minus with your plus in all
support skillls.  I did
this to model the fact that some people would actually be better at
specialized actions than at the general action.
So ther is no upper limit on the bonus thus received.  Should there be?
Should a RANK 7 called shot guy get a plus 1% for doing an upper body called
shot?    I don't have much of a problem with that.  If someone is RANK 20 in
called shot rifle and they do an upper body called shot(-20 penalty) they
would be +40 to-hit because of their called shot skill.  Gross- but rank 20
is gross.  I don't have a problem with that.  Currently almost all to-hit
based support skills give 3% per RANK in the support skill.  Quickstrike
skills give 1 SPD point per rank.

Also support skills are above and beyond secondaries.  You cannot use a
support skill as a secondary.  And you can use as many support skills as you
are using their functions.   You can do a great-blow, quick strike, instant
attack, feinting, lunge- and use all 5 of those skills PLUS two secondaries,
two tertiaries and a general skill.

Yea- for some people no roll is neccessary! :-)   However there is no longer

than 3% per rank.

>Now does this change effect Ki Focus,

Ki Focus is a seperate skill that has no speed effects.  I believe it takes
10 counts to do and is good for one action.  It allows the user to pour KI
into damage and to-hit chance.  The to-hit bonus for this will also be
limited to the raw BSC=> (RANK*10+LVF)

>Mage Trance, Battle Trance,

These also cannot be criticalled- and, I believe, they will no longer add
bonuses to hit except as tertiaries(1% per rank).  They will make
perceptions easier (3% per rank) and possibly reduce endurance cost while in
the trance state but not add significant pluses to hit.

God i don't know.  I hate Katas.  :-) *grin*   Right now- as of Rev 6.0 -
Kata add 1% per rank to the to-hit chance and they add 1 SPD point per rank
to all actions in the Kata.  It is as a support skill.

I am thinking of forcing all actions in a Kata sequence to be Instant
Attacks.  *shrug*   Not thinking about that right now.....

I hear you.  I don't think I want to change the perception minuses (when in
a trance satte all other perceptions are at half whatever value they would
have.)  However- there may be other bonuses for being in a trance.  Can you
thin kof any?   Here are the current bonuses:

(1) 1% per rank
(2) 3% per rank added to appropriate perception and perception is applied
for duration of trance.
(3) subjective greater depth of information and touch-n-feel in that
environment.

Can you critical a Ki Focus?

What do you mean a Mage/Battle Trance does not add to to-hit?  I thought
that the whole purpose of these was that it added 15%+3% per rank to the
success chance of applicable skills while in the trance?

I like Katas the way they are but I do not think that you should be able to
critical on them.

I think the only thing that you should be able to critical on is Ki Focus
because in that case (a) it is really a Discipline casting and (b) your
% bonus is based on the number of END you put into it so it appears
to be an action that affects another action rather than a support skill.

Instead of 3, you could kick in a nice quantitative bonus level of

"Re: BT: Re: Endurance","     I'm right on board with regard to The Endurance Question.  I agree 
     that basing it on criticals is appropriate and elegant.  
     
     However, I'd like to weigh in on the Recovery Question (230lbs.).  
     Although it may be easier to play, I'd like to propose that Physical 
     and Mental Recovery are different and should be calculated separately.  
     I could get how HTK recovery stages of 25% (seconds, minutes, days, 
     weeks) is appropriate for Physical Recovery.  I'm not so sure it is 
     best modelled that way for Mental Recovery.  
     
     Alex is right when he says that you enter deep sleep a couple hours 
     after head hits pillow.  However, that is not the case with an 
     'exhausted' person.  The plunge into deep sleep is much faster.  The 
     body works directly on deep sleep to completely make up the deficit.  
     Also, it is hard to imagine what Mental Recovery would still be needed 
     after any 12-hour sleep.  To say that days later you are still not 
     Recovered is contrary even to subjective experience.  
     
     I propose that all Mental Recovery be complete within one 'sleep' 
     session, and that sleep sessions generally last 8-12 hours, or, at the 
     outside - 20 hours.  
     
     Now this is not to say that Mental Exhaustion might not cause some 
     attendant Physical Exhaustion, and that it may take days to recover 
     from the aforesaid Physical Exhaustion.  Indeed, I think this is 
     closer to reality.  Days after one's all-nighter, it's not what you've 
     done to your Mind that you're recovering from, it's what you've done 
     to your body.  
     
     So unless it's already in there, I propose that Mental Exhaustion 
     provide hits to Physical Agility etc., and that Mental Meta-Exhaustion 
     reduce your physical well-being, as well.

Way to low.  In my post with the 6.1 changes I include some new Meta-EXT 
recovery rates:
     
.5 per hour of deep sleep.
.25 per hour of complete rest
     
> The recovery numbers all say END and EXT, but we use PEX and

>> Your second hour of sleep is medium sleep and gives you 4 EXT, 0 MEXT 
>> All following hours of sleep are deep sleep and give you 8 EXT, 0.5 
>> MEXT
     
Ummm..... they happen simultaneously and independant of each other.  So any 
recovery numbers we bandy about are for BOTH Physical and Mental versions, 
and they occur simo- so in the first hour of sleep you recover 2 physical 
exhaustion and two mental exhaustion.

That isn't bad.  It is simple and you would have to deal with it except in 
the rare case where the player wants it and then it would be a big deal to 
determine the ratio.

In Rev 6.0 the answer is yes.


ON JIM's SKILL DESCRIPTION:

Great except if Kata gives 3% per rank then I think it would have to drop to
(RANK/2) SPD points.  To keep it from being too powerful.

Okay- let us try this on for size.  We will have Kata and Mage trance be
support skills.

Kata: +3%/RANK, +RANK/2 SPD... [condition: all actions are instant attacks]
Trance: +15%+RANK*3 to all appropriate actions including PERCEPTION.

You get one primary skill => RANK*10 + LVF, SPD=RANK-2, DAM=RANK-2
One general skill => +RANK*3, SPD=(RANK-2)/2, DAM=(RANK-2)/2
Two secondaries => +RANK*3, SPD=(RANK-2)/2, DAM=(RANK-2)/2
Two tertiaries => +RANK
Two support skills=>variable.  Support skills could be used as secondaries,
and if more than two support skills are needed secondary slots can be used.

No skill can appear in the Final Success chance more than once.

What do you guys think?

OK, lets look at the current chances. 


At 3% per rank but now using instant attacks then 
my to-hit chances go down drastically.

Modifier for the Kata Difficulty (-15%)

First technique (-40%) 
Second Technique (-60%)
Third Technique (-80%)

Bonus for rank in Kata at rank 8 (+24%)

On first through third strike it will be at an additional -16%,-36%, -56% beyond what it costs currently.

Due to the description of Instant Attack changing over to Rank/2 for SPD is equivalent to saying 
Rank/2 speed points.

Speed = 10  (5 INIT 5 SPD)

With Katana at 13,  		130% SPD = 11

Wakasashi at 10     		+30%,+4
Combat Perception at 7 		+21%, +2
G:Style at 8			+24%, +3

Kata at 8			+24%,+8

So total max generated speed points (including instant attack rule addition ) of 34 SPD. This can cut

"RE: (4) Re: Support skills (new rules alert)","I don't feel that Kata are too powerful at the moment.  I am not sure I was
using them right as per 6.0 but I was taking Kata as +3%/rank to SC and
+1SPD/Rank.  Sounds gross?  Not really.  The reason that I don't use
Kata that often is two fold. Correct me if I am wrong.

If you start a kata you must execute the moves of the kata in
order starting at a specific point and ending at a specific point, both of
which must be declared before you start any of the kata.  If you deviate
from the pre-programmed course of the kata you are HOSED by MASSIVE
minuses to anything you attempt.  These minuses should not be easily
overcome by high level characters but I forget what they are.

Also the steps of a kata should be pretty damn specific; like attack with a
lunging sword strike followed by a parry followed by a thrust, retreat and
dodge.  If you kill the person with the first sword strike your only options
are to continue with meaningless motions or abort the kata at massive
minuses.  You cannot switch targets unless the kata says you switch
targets in which case if no one is there you are HOSED again.

The point I am trying to make is that to me kata's seemed balanced because
they were high gain for high commitment.  If you used a kata it was only
in the rare circumstance when it was exactly what you wanted to do and
then you were committing a large amount of time/resources for a gain
in SC and SPD.  Of course for Sigmund, my kata involve the use of
sorceries as well and so there is a good amount of MEND which is being
committed.  This makes choosing a kata even more of a commitment.

In Rev 6.0 the answer is yes.


ON JIM's SKILL DESCRIPTION:

Great except if Kata gives 3% per rank then I think it would have to drop to
(RANK/2) SPD points.  To keep it from being too powerful.

Okay- let us try this on for size.  We will have Kata and Mage trance be
support skills.

Kata: +3%/RANK, +RANK/2 SPD... [condition: all actions are instant attacks]
Trance: +15%+RANK*3 to all appropriate actions including PERCEPTION.

You get one primary skill => RANK*10 + LVF, SPD=RANK-2, DAM=RANK-2
One general skill => +RANK*3, SPD=(RANK-2)/2, DAM=(RANK-2)/2
Two secondaries => +RANK*3, SPD=(RANK-2)/2, DAM=(RANK-2)/2
Two tertiaries => +RANK
Two support skills=>variable.  Support skills could be used as secondaries,
and if more than two support skills are needed secondary slots can be used.

No skill can appear in the Final Success chance more than once.

"BT endurance","I think you all have been playing high level characters too long. ; ) 
 Do you remember when people roll to see if they succeed rather than 
what level of critical they get !! 

Marc writes about his ""mid level"" character with a 200% strike 
chance! --- Hiemdal save us!

I don't see the problem with having high endurance type skills reduce 
endurance/exhaustion costs as well as increasing effect.  After all 
no one seems to mind that rank in sword gives automatic pluses to 
both damage and weapon speed.

It could be that for skills where conserving endurance isn't a high 
priority, like swinging a sword that the rank provides no automatic 
bonuses.  And no, I don't feel bad that someone with a RNK 9 in sword 
spends the same amount of energy as a RNK 3 swordsweilder. Maybe 
doing those extra 4 points of damage is worth it.

In conclusion the following points.

(1)  Some skills Running, Swimming, Rowing, (Reading e-mail) that 
require a controlled expenditure of a great deal of endurance should 
receive an automatic per rank advantage that the player can use to 
reduce endurance costs. 

(2)  Characters may choose to use critical effects in any skill to 
reduce endurance costs, this would allow for the heroic day long 
slaughter of cook stealing orcs.  I think the system proposed should 
work fine for that.

(3)  As much as possible the burden of the book keeping should fall 
on the hands of the players, for the most part it doesn't make any 
difference so players can safely ignore this.  But if it is an 
important part of the character concept ( 'I don't trust horses, I 
can outrun any of them every day of the week anyway...') then the 
player can work out the correct reduction factor and apply it when 
ever the GM announces the standard endurance/exhaustion costs.

(4)  Finally all your characters really are too high level :)

Well- I want to create a useful gaming model and one that has some
relationship to reality and allows characters to do what they would in
reality.   However- that notwithstanding- I agree with your point below.

SPD

This example is well chosen.  VERY scary.  I crunched some numbers and the
Desert Eagle could get really fast really quickly....  I think for no- at
least for a micro-revision like this- I am not going to much with this.

I am going to keep letting people buy Speed Points for 2 points of damage
per.  It will not go the other way though.  I am open to it going that way
but not in this Rev.

BTW:  I am thinking of a nomenclature change.  People have been having alot
of trouble with SPEED points, initiative, etc.

What do you guys think of these words:  (This is not a system change- this
is just defining jargon!:-))

Speed Points(SPD PTS) => the number generated by the characters PSPD/MSPD
stat, plus the LVF/10, plus the RANK modifiers- primary(RANK-2) ,
secondaries(RANK-2/2) and general(RANK-2/2).

Initiative points(INIT) => the number subtracted from the characters
initiative roll.  Usually half the speed points, rounded up.

Action Points(ACT) => the points used to speed up actions, perform passive
actions or set-up.  Usually half the speed points, rounded down.

Negative initiative would turn into action points on a 1/1 basis.

Quickstrike would generate SPD PTS- 1 per RANK.    Kata would generate SPD
PTS as well.

with extra speed but not speed with reduced damage?

Bardic Tales Revision 6.1 Change Sheet
January 7th, 1998

TABLE OF CONTENTS:

 ENDURANCE
 SPEED
 SETUP
 SUPPORT SKILLS
   KATA/TRANCE/KIFOCUS
 APPENDIX 1 - ENDURANCE RESEARCH
 APPENDIX 2 - CRITICALS
 APPENDIX 3 - SKILL TYPES

--- --- ---
          ON ENDURANCE

In this conversation Physical and Mental Endurances are equivalent.
Therefore we refer to
END and EXT- but these refer to both Physical Endurance(END) and Mental
Endurance(MEN).
Likewise for exhaustion.  Physical and Mental endurance and exhaustion are
recovered
simultaneously and identically.

Currently END, EXT, and M-EXT (Endurance, Exhaustion, and Meta-Exhaustion)
use the idea that
Endurance is like a pool of energy that you have a certain amount of and
that increases as
one becomes more skilled.  Actions use up Endurance like fuel.

ENDURANCE:  Basic ""fuel unit"".
It returns after use at 1 per ten counts... usually all back in 3-5 minutes.
Resting or
sleeping doubles the return rate.

EXHAUSTION: EXT comes off the top of END at a rate of 1 per 10 END expended.
It returns at 1 per two hours of rest, 2 per hour of light sleep, 4 per hour
of medium
sleep, and 8 per hour of full deep sleep.  Meals can also restore 1-3 EXT
three times a
day.  Meditation is as medium sleep.

META-EXHAUSTION: M-EXT comes off END as well.  One accumulates one M-EXT for
every 10 EXT
one accumulates.

It returns at a rate of: 1 per 4 hours of complete rest, 1 per 2 hours of
deep sleep(Deep
sleep is usually achieved in the third hour of sleep)

Your first hour of sleep is light sleep and gives you 2 EXT, .25 M-EXT
Your second hour of sleep is medium sleep and gives you 4 EXT, .25 M-EXT
All following hours of sleep are deep sleep and give you 8 EXT, 0.5 MEXT

If a character is moving or acting at some percentage of full effort
(travelling with slower
companions, taking their time) they only expend that percentage of the END
cost of the
action.  I.e. if a character has a walk of 1.4 and the group is moving at
.7, she only
expends 50% of the END cost for that type of movement.

Levels of critical can be used to decrease endurance cost just like they can
be used to
increase damage.  The following table describes the effect:

     Levels Of Critical Endurance
- x1
0 x2/3
1 x1/2
2 x2/5
3 x1/3
4 x2/7
5 x1/4
...

Now- I have recently been convinced that the recovery system- which is based
on straight point recovery- is not a good analogy to what ""really happens.""
Unfortunately it is  easy and playable.    It has been suggested that we go
to a percentage based system

PROPOSAL: whenever the rules call for recovering 1 ENDURANCE or EXHAUSTION
it read as 1% of
the character's END or EXT.

PROPOSAL: Character's be allowed to roll against their skills to reduce
endurance loss if
they wish.

--- --- ---
          ON SPEED

Speed Points(SPD PTS) => the number generated by the characters PSPD/MSPD
stat, plus the LVF/10, plus the RANK modifiers: primary(RANK-2),
secondaries([RANK-2]/2), and general([RANK-2]/2).

Initiative points(INIT) => the number subtracted from the characters
initiative roll.  Usually half the speed points, rounded up.

Action Points(ACT) => the points used to speed up actions, perform passive
actions or set-up.  Usually half the speed points, rounded down.
Negative initiative would turn into action points on a 1/1 basis.

Quickstrike would generate SPD PTS- 1 per RANK.    Kata would generate INIT
PTS.  A specific Quickdraw skill would generate 1 ACT per RANK.

To buy 1 ACT => 10% to-hit or 2 points of damage or 1 negative initiative

PROPOSAL: Take damage out of the formula entirely.

One negative initiative point or ACT will buy you:  1 SPD point or 2%-to-hit
or 1 count off
of a passive action (perception, support skill initiation, general skill
activation, etc.)
So 8 ACTION points will buy you a full passive perception or general skill
activation.

--- --- ---
          ON SETUP
Set-up in real counts will give you 5% per count and is limited to:

(1) 10 + KIF/2 counts of set-up AND

(2) a maximum value equal to  (RANK*10+LVF)- or the default value(saves,
MAP, etc.)- of the skill being set-up for.

Do not include secondaries or generals in set-up base chance and do not
include the difficulty of the skill.  Only include the RAW SUCCESS CHANCE:
RANK*10 + LVF.

This is because the more difficult actions are where set-up is really needed
and IMO
makes the most difference in real-life.

The set-up skill allows you to double the set-up bonus per count for the
first RANK counts
of set-up.

--- --- ---
          ON SUPPORT SKILLS


You may no longer roll against support skills.  They give their
3% per rank or 1 SPD point per rank and that is it.  This change alleviates
two problems:
(1) People have been getting high bonuses because they are criticalling
their
support skill rolls.  This is often because of level factor and other
bonuses that already give to the primary skill, so it is redundant bonuses.

(2) This change reduces the number of rolls people have to make in play.
Your
quickstrike just adds Rank in SPD points to your action.  Period!  Your
florentine gives you 3% per rank- period.  No need to do another roll- no
need to recalculate for levels of success, etc.

This is a blessing for people with low ranks because it means you don't fail
your roll either- you always get 6% for your rank 2 support skill!:-)

Support skills can go above the negative modifier for a skill. (I.e. a RANK
15 Florentine
character gets +45% and the minus is only minus 40%.  This person is 5%
better florentining
than not florentining.)

You may use as many support skills as applicable skills you are using.  If
you have unused
support skills they may be used as secondaries.
PROPOSAL:  Support skills can be used as secondary ski
skills when not being used as support
skills

ON KATA/TRANCE/KI FOCUS

>Now does this change effect Ki Focus,

Ki Focus is a separate skill that has no speed effects.  It takes
10 counts to do, and is good for one action.  It allows the user to pour KI
into damage and to-hit chance.  The to-hit bonus for this will also be
limited to the raw SC=> (RANK*10+LVF) or the max damage of the attack.  Adds
RANK/4 to-hit
or RANK/8 in damage per MEN used.

>Mage Trance, Battle Trance,

These also cannot be criticalled- They will make perceptions and all
applicable skills
easier (15% + 3% per rank) and possibly reduce endurance cost while in the
trance state.
When a trance is induced a specific perception is activated.  You must roll
to enter a
trance.  It takes 30 counts, and no crit effects can be used for to-hit
modification.  The
pluses here are also limited to the raw success chance of the primary skill
being modified.

>and Katas ?

As of Rev 6.0 - Kata add 3% per rank to the to-hit chance and they add 1
INIT point per rank
to all actions in the Kata.  It is as a support skill.  All actions in a
Kata sequence are Instant Attacks.

--- --- ---
APPENDIX 1
>From Jim Mochel on 1/5/98:

Ahh. This harkens back to the good old days of game design ! Here, for those
who never had
to listen to me on this topic :-), is a quick summary of the research I did
for SH. Muscle
fatigue models just as you might expect , with expenditures of stored energy
(stage 1) up to
the point where the body starts trying to bring in other energy reserves
(stage 2) , then
when those are exhausted, continued exercise causes damage to the tissue
(stage 3). Stage 1
expenditures are gained back quickly (in hours) while stage 2 expenditures
take days to
recover from.

Fatigue from aerobic activity is related but not necessarily linked. As a
person starts
exercising their breathing deepens to bring in more oxygen for burning
energy. This
continues with the increase of activity until the point where the
respiratory system is no
longer able to bring in enough oxygen (the famous oxygen debt). At this
point the bodystarts
burning stored oxygen (in other forms). What differs for many activities is
the percentage
of stored versus intake oxygen being used.

Sprinters go into oxygen debt very quickly and experience much less muscular
fatigue for a
given event than marathon runners who expend a continuous but small
percentage of stored
oxygen throughout the race. Muscular fatigue by that time is often the main
recovery item.
The oxygen pool does increase in size as a result of training but it is not
that elastic.
The amount of stored oxygen is always a much smaller amount than could be
desired.
Experienced athletes (Cyclists and Runners have been extensively studied)
simply expend less
energy per action.

Oxygen debt is recovered very quickly (AKA Second Wind) (scale: minutes) but
you recover
less effectively each successive time you blow through that pool of energy.
Recovery from extended labor appears to be a _relatively_ constant value.
Oxygen debt
recovers in minutes, stored muscular energy in days, damage in weeks... And
the variation is
not that great between person to person.

Appendix 2- ON CRITICALS

>The only caveat with this is that it seems ambiguous to me what a
>0 level of critical means.

Okay.  This is, I think, a nomenclature problem.   It is axiomatic to most
RPGs and realism simulations  that there is a chance for particularly good
successes.  Out of this, the concept of ""criticals"" or ""very good success""
comes.

In BT the distinctions were made along these breakpoints:

SN = Success number = number you need to roll to succeed in the skill
(RANK*10 + LVF + MODs)

CSN = Critical Success Number = 1/4 of your success number.

Under the success number:  Normal Success  skill successfully applied,
half-damage
Under half the SN:         Crit Level 0        full-damage
Under quarter the SN(CSK): Crit Level 1        1.5* damage
Under CSN-10:              Crit Level 2        2* damage
Under CSN-20:              Crit Level 3        2.5* damage
Under CSN-30:              Crit Level 4        3* damage etc.

To get the damage modifier of a crit, divide the crit level by 2 and add 1.
That is the
damage multiplier.

The crit level is the amount  (CSN - number rolled)/10 + 1

Crit level 0 is just the name of the level.  It counts as a single level of
critical.

>Lets say that I punch and for some reason
>I want to reduce my endurance as well as upping my damage.  I
>roll a level 2 critical.  Now what can I do?  Can I allocate 2 levels to
>damage and 0 levels to reducing endurance?


Yes- but 0 levels of critical buy you nothing. Example:
SN=100 so CSN=25.
I roll a 66.  Thai s a normal success.  No levels of critical.
I roll a43.  That is a crit level 0.  It is one level of critical to apply
to whatever I want.
I roll a 22.  That is a crit level 1.  It is two levels of critical to play
with.  I could put one to Endurance(2/3 cost) and one to damage(full
damage).
I roll a 13.  That is a crit level 2.  It is three levels of endurance to
play with.  I could put two to damage(1.5 times damage) and one to
endurance(2/3 cost).

ENDURANCE

Summary of endurance rules for revision 6.1.  I like it.  I vote we
go with this as the base rules set.  (By the way I think the term
complete rest is not defined in the discussion).

Proposal #1
I vote yes on the condition that it says ""a number equal to 1% of the
characters total endurance rounded up to the nearest integer"".

That way if your endurance is below 100 it is the same as the normal
rules and if your endurance is a disgusting 450 then you recover 5
points each time an average human would recover one.

Proposal #2
I vote no.  I think the critical results cover this sufficiently.

SPEED

I like it all although I think your wording is still a little confused.

Proposal #1
I vote yes.  Eliminate damage trade off for speed completely.

SETUP

I like it.

SUPPORT SKILLS

As far as the part where you say you may not critical support
skills, that is fine although I may argue strongly as to what does
and does not count as a support skill.  So far the only example
of something which people might consider a support skill but
which I think should be criticallable is Ki Focus and that has been
specifically identified as not a support skill.

As far as the part where you say support skills can go beyond
the penalty which they are canceling, I think this is probably
going to lead to abuse.  I suppose one example of this would
be Joe Slimey who doesn't really want to wear armor putting
on some light cloth with a -1 PDEF mod just so that he can
use his rank 10.0 in armor wearing to get a +30 bonus to his
defense that he otherwise couldn't get.  Or maybe everyone
will start great blowing because it actually ups their chances
to hit.  I don't buy the rationalization here.

   KATA/TRANCE/KIFOCUS

   On Ki Focus, this seems different than the way it was before but
    I guess this is fine.

    On Trances,  this also seems different and I am terrified by
     your vague undefined reference to endurance costs.  Lets
     either drop that or quantify it and I think with all the other
    END changes mucking with trance effects on END is a bad
    idea.

    Kata, this seems fine.

Bardic Tales Revision 6.1 Change Sheet

TABLE OF CONTENTS:

 ENDURANCE

 SETUP
 SUPPORT SKILLS
   KATA/TRANCE/KIFOCUS
 APPENDIX 1 - ENDURANCE RESEARCH
 APPENDIX 2 - CRITICALS
 APPENDIX 3 - SKILL TYPES

--- --- ---
          ON ENDURANCE

In this conversation Physical and Mental Endurances are equivalent.
Therefore we refer to
END and EXT- but these refer to both Physical Endurance(END) and Mental
Endurance(MEN).
Likewise for exhaustion.  Physical and Mental endurance and exhaustion are
recovered
simultaneously and identically.

Currently END, EXT, and M-EXT (Endurance, Exhaustion, and Meta-Exhaustion)
use the idea that
Endurance is like a pool of energy that you have a certain amount of and
that increases as
one becomes more skilled.  Actions use up Endurance like fuel.

ENDURANCE:  Basic ""fuel unit"".
It returns after use at 1 per ten counts... usually all back in 3-5 minutes.
Resting or
sleeping doubles the return rate.

EXHAUSTION: EXT comes off the top of END at a rate of 1 per 10 END expended.
It returns at 1 per two hours of rest, 2 per hour of light sleep, 4 per hour
of medium
sleep, and 8 per hour of full deep sleep.  Meals can also restore 1-3 EXT
three times a
day.  Meditation is as medium sleep.

META-EXHAUSTION: M-EXT comes off END as well.  One accumulates one M-EXT for
every 10 EXT
one accumulates.

It returns at a rate of: 1 per 4 hours of complete rest, 1 per 2 hours of
deep sleep(Deep
sleep is usually achieved in the third hour of sleep)

Your first hour of sleep is light sleep and gives you 2 EXT, .25 M-EXT
Your second hour of sleep is medium sleep and gives you 4 EXT, .25 M-EXT
All following hours of sleep are deep sleep and give you 8 EXT, 0.5 MEXT

If a character is moving or acting at some percentage of full effort
(travelling with slower
companions, taking their time) they only expend that percentage of the END
cost of the
action.  I.e. if a character has a walk of 1.4 and the group is moving at
.7, she only
expends 50% of the END cost for that type of movement.

Levels of critical can be used to decrease endurance cost just like they can
be used to
increase damage.  The following table describes the effect:

     Levels Of Critical Endurance
- x1
0 x2/3
1 x1/2
2 x2/5
3 x1/3
4 x2/7
5 x1/4
...

Now- I have recently been convinced that the recovery system- which is based
on straight point recovery- is not a good analogy to what ""really happens.""
Unfortunately it is  easy and playable.    It has been suggested that we go
to a percentage based system

PROPOSAL: whenever the rules call for recovering 1 ENDURANCE or EXHAUSTION
it read as 1% of
the character's END or EXT.

PROPOSAL: Character's be allowed to roll against their skills to reduce
endurance loss if
they wish.

--- --- ---
          ON SPEED

Speed Points(SPD PTS) => the number generated by the characters PSPD/MSPD
stat, plus the LVF/10, plus the RANK modifiers: primary(RANK-2),
secondaries([RANK-2]/2), and general([RANK-2]/2).

Initiative points(INIT) => the number subtracted from the characters
initiative roll.  Usually half the speed points, rounded up.

Action Points(ACT) => the points used to speed up actions, perform passive
actions or set-up.  Usually half the speed points, rounded down.
Negative initiative would turn into action points on a 1/1 basis.

Quickstrike would generate SPD PTS- 1 per RANK.    Kata would generate INIT
PTS.  A specific Quickdraw skill would generate 1 ACT per RANK.

To buy 1 ACT => 10% to-hit or 2 points of damage or 1 negative initiative

PROPOSAL: Take damage out of the formula entirely.

One negative initiative point or ACT will buy you:  1 SPD point or 2%-to-hit
or 1 count off
of a passive action (perception, support skill initiation, general skill
activation, etc.)
So 8 ACTION points will buy you a full passive perception or general skill
activation.

--- --- ---
          ON SETUP
Set-up in real counts will give you 5% per count and is limited to:

(1) 10 + KIF/2 counts of set-up AND

(2) a maximum value equal to  (RANK*10+LVF)- or the default value(saves,
MAP, etc.)- of the skill being set-up for.

Do not include secondaries or generals in set-up base chance and do not
include the difficulty of the skill.  Only include the RAW SUCCESS CHANCE:
RANK*10 + LVF.

This is because the more difficult actions are where set-up is really needed
and IMO
makes the most difference in real-life.

The set-up skill allows you to double the set-up bonus per count for the
first RANK counts
of set-up.

--- --- ---
          ON SUPPORT SKILLS


You may no longer roll against support skills.  They give their
3% per rank or 1 SPD point per rank and that is it.  This change alleviates
two problems:
(1) People have been getting high bonuses because they are criticalling
their
support skill rolls.  This is often because of level factor and other
bonuses that already give to the primary skill, so it is redundant bonuses.

(2) This change reduces the number of rolls people have to make in play.
Your
quickstrike just adds Rank in SPD points to your action.  Period!  Your
florentine gives you 3% per rank- period.  No need to do another roll- no
need to recalculate for levels of success, etc.

This is a blessing for people with low ranks because it means you don't fail
your roll either- you always get 6% for your rank 2 support skill!:-)

Support skills can go above the negative modifier for a skill. (I.e. a RANK
15 Florentine
character gets +45% and the minus is only minus 40%.  This person is 5%
better florentining
than not florentining.)

You may use as many support skills as applicable skills you are using.  If
you have unused
support skills they may be used as secondaries.
PROPOSAL:  Support skills can be used as secondary ski
skills when not being used as support
skills

ON KATA/TRANCE/KI FOCUS

>Now does this change effect Ki Focus,

Ki Focus is a separate skill that has no speed effects.  It takes
10 counts to do, and is good for one action.  It allows the user to pour KI
into damage and to-hit chance.  The to-hit bonus for this will also be
limited to the raw SC=> (RANK*10+LVF) or the max damage of the attack.  Adds
RANK/4 to-hit
or RANK/8 in damage per MEN used.

>Mage Trance, Battle Trance,

These also cannot be criticalled- They will make perceptions and all
applicable skills
easier (15% + 3% per rank) and possibly reduce endurance cost while in the
trance state.
When a trance is induced a specific perception is activated.  You must roll
to enter a
trance.  It takes 30 counts, and no crit effects can be used for to-hit
modification.  The
pluses here are also limited to the raw success chance of the primary skill
being modified.

>and Katas ?

As of Rev 6.0 - Kata add 3% per rank to the to-hit chance and they add 1
INIT point per rank
to all actions in the Kata.  It is as a support skill.  All actions in a
Kata sequence are Instant Attacks.

--- --- ---
APPENDIX 1
>From Jim Mochel on 1/5/98:

Ahh. This harkens back to the good old days of game design ! Here, for those
who never had
to listen to me on this topic :-), is a quick summary of the research I did
for SH. Muscle
fatigue models just as you might expect , with expenditures of stored energy
(stage 1) up to
the point where the body starts trying to bring in other energy reserves
(stage 2) , then
when those are exhausted, continued exercise causes damage to the tissue
(stage 3). Stage 1
expenditures are gained back quickly (in hours) while stage 2 expenditures
take days to
recover from.

Fatigue from aerobic activity is related but not necessarily linked. As a
person starts
exercising their breathing deepens to bring in more oxygen for burning
energy. This
continues with the increase of activity until the point where the
respiratory system is no
longer able to bring in enough oxygen (the famous oxygen debt). At this
point the bodystarts
burning stored oxygen (in other forms). What differs for many activities is
the percentage
of stored versus intake oxygen being used.

Sprinters go into oxygen debt very quickly and experience much less muscular
fatigue for a
given event than marathon runners who expend a continuous but small
percentage of stored
oxygen throughout the race. Muscular fatigue by that time is often the main
recovery item.
The oxygen pool does increase in size as a result of training but it is not
that elastic.
The amount of stored oxygen is always a much smaller amount than could be
desired.
Experienced athletes (Cyclists and Runners have been extensively studied)
simply expend less
energy per action.

Oxygen debt is recovered very quickly (AKA Second Wind) (scale: minutes) but
you recover
less effectively each successive time you blow through that pool of energy.
Recovery from extended labor appears to be a _relatively_ constant value.
Oxygen debt
recovers in minutes, stored muscular energy in days, damage in weeks... And
the variation is
not that great between person to person.

Okay.  This is, I think, a nomenclature problem.   It is axiomatic to most

successes.  Out of this, the concept of ""criticals"" or ""very good success""
comes.

Too complicated.  A rank-based modifier (perhaps like the skill-speed

No idea.  I have no Kata skills and haven't really thought about them.

Maybe if Alex threatened to explain them again? <g>

Interesting, really, if a bit overwhelming at first.

I agree.  Plus, the formula seems twisted to get what you say is there, 
rather than flowing from the underlying physics.  (Yes, zen game 
mechanics.)

As long as we're playing with semantics here, Alex, can we define things 
so that most people understand it right off?  I, for one, find the ""Crit 
Level 0"" to be confusing, especially when it means you have a 'level' of 
Crit to use somewhere.

Call them ""Success Levels"", and give them an effect of SL/2, and you will 
have must the same result.

SL1 - roll under skill - 1/2 effect
SL2 - roll under 1/2   - full effect
SL3 - roll under 1/4   - 1.5 times effect
SL4 - 1/4 minus 10     - 2 times effect

etc, etc, etc.

                     my thoughts,
                               -Myth.

I like it---- someone said to round it off, but I'm not sure I'd go with
that-- I'd say push this rule up a level, IE, make it optional. Low
level characters won't use it, high(er) level characters can.

BTW, when I said Chuck was a ""mid"" level character, I was being
sarcastic.

I can see why this is in here, but I think it may just be
over-generalized. When applied to MELEE weapons only, I don't think it
causes unbalanced play-- on the contrary, it allows for a very fast but
low damage strike,or a slower full damage attack.  For example, if I
want to poke someone in the eye, I want to do it very quickly, but not
really very hard. 

I agree that it doesn't work for missile weapons- I can see the 1 count
Howitzer shot now. ;-)

I say leave it in for melee only.

I'd tend to put a slot here- 2 or 3. Otherwise I know _I_ could design a
character to do some major abusing, and I'm not even a power gamer.

Too complicated.  A rank-based modifier (perhaps like the skill-speed

No idea.  I have no Kata skills and haven't really thought about them.

I agree.  Plus, the formula seems twisted to get what you say is there,
rather than flowing from the underlying physics.  (Yes, zen game
mechanics.)

As long as we're playing with semantics here, Alex, can we define things
so that most people understand it right off?  I, for one, find the ""Crit
Level 0"" to be confusing, especially when it means you have a 'level' of
Crit to use somewhere.

Call them ""Success Levels"", and give them an effect of SL/2, and you will
have must the same result.

SL1 - roll under skill - 1/2 effect
SL2 - roll under 1/2   - full effect
SL3 - roll under 1/4   - 1.5 times effect
SL4 - 1/4 minus 10     - 2 times effect

etc, etc, etc.

                     my thoughts,
                               -Myth.

My reply to your reply :-)

I would much prefer a rank based modification to END costs for much the
same reasons :-)

[Warning Humble Opinion Ahead]

Is a crit roll modified END cost simpler ? I really don't think there is a substantial
difference. I certainly think being able to say I have rank 10 so I use 1/2 the normal
END for this period of time is simpler than saying I have a 160% Success Chance so
my average crit level will be X which will lower my END costs to Y over a period of time.

But currently BT allows both types of modification for Success Chance (SC), Speed, and Damage
Rank modifies all of these statically (SC = +RANK*10, SPD = +RANK-2, and DAM = +RANK-2.
and criticals modify all of these dynamically (see the rapidly fluctuating rules for mods :-) ).
I propose that we extend both mechanisms to END cost.

END cost range is much less elastic than either SPD or DAM so I would suggest some sort of
really limited set of static mods. Maybe something like: END = Cost / ( RANK/4)  with a minimum END cost of
1. This would mean that Rank 12 would only cost 1/3 the normal cost for END.


JAW>>> This sounds acceptable.  I am assuming that this translates to the following:
RANK 0-5		Normal END cost
RANK 6-9		END Cost = 1/2 BASE
RANK 10-13		END Cost = 1/3 BASE
RANK 14-17		END Cost = 1/4 BASE

actually I take that back.  I like the idea (my previous fear was just because the
amount was unquantified) but I think the drop off is too dramatic.  Here is my
counter-proposal:  END = Cost * 2 / ( 1 + RANK/4) rounded to produce the
following progression:
RANK 0-1		Normal END cost or if you are mean 2x END cost
RANK 2-5		Normal END cost
RANK 6-9		END Cost = 2/3 BASE
RANK 10-13		END Cost = 1/2 BASE
RANK 14-17		END Cost = 2/5 BASE

Alarmist  ? Maybe. I just hate to change weapon skill spreadsheets :-)
If anything it helps  people like Menahan.  I have never considered Kata to be presets so the
difference would +7 for me. Thinking about that I would suggest a totally different
direction for Kata. If we consider them as a series of presets then the breakout mods
would be those of a preset breakout and the skill could be treated as a secondary.
+3%/Rank,DAM=(Rank-2)/2, Spd=(Rank-2)/2.

For Menahan this would change his current (average effective) speed points from 32
according to Rev 6.0 to 30 as opposed to 35 in Alex's proposal. For joe fighter this
would mean that kata would be useful in VERY limited situations but it still could
be used. It also eliminates applying the escalating mods of the INSTANT Attack
combat option unless you specifically design that into the kata.

JAW>> I sort of buy this.  It is a reduction on the current benefit of Katas but I am OK with
that though I do not think that it is necessary.  I am assuming that this would be in addition
to your two secondaries and I am also think that the break out mods should continue to be
harsher than the preset break out mods just to distinguish it as a higher commitment
sequence.

I agree- let us make it an optional rule- it is 1 for 1 unless the character
opts too then they can go to 1% instead of 1, rounded up.

Proposal #2

>POOKIE: I vote no.  I think the critical results cover this sufficiently.

Okay- this seems universal too although there is the crit vs. ranks -based
discussion below.

Hmmmm......   I think it is too complicated.  As I try to imagine it I don't
imagine it working.  I am going to swing towards Peter's response which was
""That extra +4 damage they get might be worth it.""  Charge them the same
endurance(1 per 6 counts) for swinging their sword at RANK 12, but in those
six counts the warrior has done three swings and killed three people makng
him much more effective per time than the RANK 1 swordsman.  *shrug*

Though I can see Jim's argument for consistancy I think it would be too much
trouble to balance it and incorporate it.

SPEED

God- i don't know.  Wher eI am thinking right now is putitng it as a Melee
Weapon only option.  Very tough though- I like having it be variable.  So-
right now I am leaning towards keeping the SPD/DAM buyoff option and
limiting it to melee weapons.

SETUP

SCORE!!!!! Yehhah!


SUPPORT SKILLS

I agree.  This is important to control.

Exactly.

>MARK: I agree with others that this is potentially unbalancing.

I have looked at this and it is related to Pook's first point.  His
armor-wearing example is an excellent example, but also it is an extreme.
Most actions supported by support skills have sufficient minuses to take
over a rank 10 before one becomes positive at all:  Florentine: -40(RANK 14
to be positive), Instant Attack: -40(RANK 14), Called Shot starts
at -20(RANK 7) and goes to -120(RANK 40!), SHoot-While-Move: starts
at -60(RANK 20), etc., etc.

Although there is the possibility of abuse I think it is small enough and
GM-controllable enough to make it not a problem.  And I like the idea of
people being so specialized- if they choose- that they are actually better
at theior specialty attack than when not using it. *shrug*

So. unless some one can show me the abusive situation I will keep them
unlimited...

Are you sure.  As I say above- I think they are self-balancing as long as I
am rigourous about what is a support skill and what is not.  If a character
has 10s in Great Blow, Lunge, Instant Attack, Called Shot with their weapon
and then they do a Instant, Lunging Great Blow to someone's Throat they
should be better than someone with only two of the five things being done.
My job as the GM is to make sure that no SUpport skill is in itself
unbalanced... so people don't start getting plusses for nothing....

Hmmmm......   I think it is too complicated.  As I try to imagine it I don't
imagine it working.  I am going to swing towards Peter's response which was
""That extra +4 damage they get might be worth it.""  Charge them the same
endurance(1 per 6 counts) for swinging their sword at RANK 12, but in those
six counts the warrior has done three swings and killed three people makng
him much more effective per time than the RANK 1 swordsman.  *shrug*

Though I can see Jim's argument for consistancy I think it would be too much
trouble to balance it and incorporate it.

SPEED

God- i don't know.  Wher eI am thinking right now is putitng it as a Melee
Weapon only option.  Very tough though- I like having it be variable.  So-
right now I am leaning towards keeping the SPD/DAM buyoff option and
limiting it to melee weapons.

SUPPORT SKILLS

>MARK: I agree with others that this is potentially unbalancing.

I have looked at this and it is related to Pook's first point.  His
armor-wearing example is an excellent example, but also it is an extreme.
Most actions supported by support skills have sufficient minuses to take
over a rank 10 before one becomes positive at all:  Florentine: -40(RANK 14
to be positive), Instant Attack: -40(RANK 14), Called Shot starts
at -20(RANK 7) and goes to -120(RANK 40!), SHoot-While-Move: starts
at -60(RANK 20), etc., etc.

Although there is the possibility of abuse I think it is small enough and
GM-controllable enough to make it not a problem.  And I like the idea of
people being so specialized- if they choose- that they are actually better
at theior specialty attack than when not using it. *shrug*

So. unless some one can show me the abusive situation I will keep them
unlimited...

Are you sure.  As I say above- I think they are self-balancing as long as I
am rigourous about what is a support skill and what is not.  If a character
has 10s in Great Blow, Lunge, Instant Attack, Called Shot with their weapon
and then they do a Instant, Lunging Great Blow to someone's Throat they
should be better than someone with only two of the five things being done.
My job as the GM is to make sure that no SUpport skill is in itself
unbalanced... so people don't start getting plusses for nothing....

Hm.  I like it.  Simple, effective, and no messy formulae or extra rolls.

If the person is making less than normal effort (say, Chuck Lee doing a
demo with first-year students), you might wish to declare a reduced rate,
as with the fast-walker-with-slow-party example you used (much) earlier. 
Nothing as formal as a rule, just the GM recognizing an atypical situation.

Keep it.  Just recognize it may be inapplicable in some cases.  A bow, for
instance, might be only half-drawn at fire, allowing a faster shot but less
damage (and range).  This won't work with a gun, or even a crossbow.

You seemed to be working towards a more generalized view of damage,
treating it as a special case of 'effect'.  I see no reason that there
couldn't be a general SPD/Effect tradeoff (in fact, I thought there already
was), as long as you acknowledge that in some cases, the effect is not
under drect control.

Treating exceptions as special on a case-by-case basis should be good
enough for most of us, and common sense makes a reasonable guide (for those
who have it).

Well, 'unlimited' is a problem for my spreadsheet, but without support

 wouldn't mind seeing a semi-definative list, though.  I live in fear of

"Re: 6.1 Summary Post - 01/07/98 [KATA only]","Let us start from scratch with the question of Kata.

(1) What are they?
A series of practiced actions that are done over and over again until the
person is smooth and competent at doing those series of actions in sequence.

(2) Why model them?  Aren't they just a practice tool used to train in
skills?

Good question.  After reading all these posts I have the same question.:-)
Mark has an answer!:-)

However, OPINION ALERT:
In REAL LIFE(TM) Kata shape the way a person fights and give the person a
benefit in how smoothly and quickly a person can perform those actions in
sequence.  The real benefit- beside the practice in the individual skills
used in the Kata - is that one gets quicker and quicker and smoother and
smoother at moving between actions and executing transitions.   This
describes one type of Kata or Form.  Other forms are designed solely to
train people in the included skills and some to enhance stats and
endurance...  The Kata skill would refer to the type I first mentioned...

That said....

I think they are worth modeling.  The only ""transition"" mechanism in BARDIC
TALES is initiative.  There are three ways to make actions flow together
faster:
(1) Use a quickstrike skill for all your actions.  (Unlikely at best)

(2) Instant Attack all your actions.  This works but..... your first action
is at -40, your second at -60 and every one thereafter is at -60.  But the
beauty is you roll a 0 on your initiative roll and can use your whole SPD as
ACTION points.  The breakdown is that your perceptions are cut in half and
you are locked in to what you said you would do.  If you try to break the
chain you need to re-roll initiative as if surprised!!!( +12 to INIT)

(3) You could use pre-sets.  Pre-sets are a declared series of actions.  It
allows you to roll 2d6/2 for initiative instead of 2d6.   It is as Instant
Attack except that you roll as if you missed your last action(+4 INIT)
instead of being surprised if you break the chain.

What I did to start was I originally conceived Kata's as a pre-determined
series of  Instant Attacks,with it giving bonuses like a support skill(3%per
RANK) and 1 INIT point per RANK in Kata.    The Kata would be broken in to
series of 2-6 action sequences that were very pre-determined.  You had to
note what support skills you were using, which hex you were acting into, and
whether the action was low, high, or mid-level.  For every sequence you had
beyond the first in a single Kata you would take a -5% to the Kata's
difficulty factor.

Now- what that created was a thing that, as Jim has noted, a low-level
character could not use.  It only became useful when the characters chances
were high enough to overcome the Instant Attack Mods.  This models real life
I think - as any of you who have studied martial arts can attest- Kata are
not useful in practical fighting until you are really good.  Then many
high-level practitioners swear by them!

So that is the thought behind Kata.  I still think that this method models
the way Kata are most closely and keeps them form being too useful- if we
swapped the Instant Attacks into Pre-sets for instance a Kata is a great
support skill to have!!!!

Now- what I have done is run some numbers and the INIT bonus is probably too
gross as Pookie says below.  I would probably have it add 3% per RANK,  SPD
AND DAM like a secondary skill(I.e. (RANK-2)/2  instead of RANK)  to all
actions in the KATA.

PROPOSAL:  Have Kata be a support skill(I.e. above and beyond the
secondaries and generals) to all skills in its umbrella.  It will add 3% per
RANK to-hit, and  (RANK-2)/2  to SPD and DAM to all of its skills.  All the
Skills would be Instant Attacks, they would be organized into sequences of
2-5 actions with reactions in between.  The Kata would have to be activated
with a successful roll, though no crit would be possible as in all support
skills.   Every sequence written into a Kata beyond the first would add -10%
to the activation roll of the Kata.

Does this clarify where I am thinking from????  Comments? I will now respond
 to the below comments...

Let me observe a few things which differ from my previous understanding
of Kata.

1.	Since you say that a kata has 2-5 actions I will assume that this
replaces the previous limitation that a kata could have no more than RANK/2
actions in it.

2.	Since you mention multiple sequences I will assume that your
interpretation of 2-5 actions is something like the following:

my three actions are front punch, snap kick and sweeping block

my kata has three sequences, they are:
	punch A in throat, kick B in knee cap, block punch from A  -pause-
	punch A in SolarPlex, block punch from A, punch A in chin -pause-
	kick B in SolarPlex, Kick A in SolarPlex, block kick from A

this is different from my previous understanding which was that a kata
with 2-5 actions in it could only have 2-5 discrete specific actions, like:

	punch A in throat, kick B in knee cap, block punch from A
	punch A in SolarPlex, block kick from B

The whole sequence/pausing thing was lost on me.

3.	What is the purpose of the reactions in between sequences?
Normally I think of reactions as points at which you can make decisions/
change your actions.  This seems counter to the concept of the kata.
Are these legal entry/exit points without the breaking-kata penalty?

4.	The way you cleverly edited your Kata post makes it appear as
if I had already agreed with your new proposal even though I had not seen
it yet.  Have you been training with the Illuminati?

5.	I will buy the whole package including the reduced speed mods
and the horrendous instant attack penalties on two conditions.  You can
enter and exit the kata at sequence break points without penalty and
the instant attack mods reset at each reaction point.  Actually, I am waffling
I am still on the fence but I will go along with you for now while I evaluate
whether I would still want to use kata as they are now defined.

Subject:	Re: 6.1 Summary Post - 01/07/98 [KATA only]

Let us start from scratch with the question of Kata.

(1) What are they?
A series of practiced actions that are done over and over again until the
person is smooth and competent at doing those series of actions in sequence.

(2) Why model them?  Aren't they just a practice tool used to train in
skills?

Good question.  After reading all these posts I have the same question.:-)
Mark has an answer!:-)

However, OPINION ALERT:
In REAL LIFE(TM) Kata shape the way a person fights and give the person a
benefit in how smoothly and quickly a person can perform those actions in
sequence.  The real benefit- beside the practice in the individual skills
used in the Kata - is that one gets quicker and quicker and smoother and
smoother at moving between actions and executing transitions.   This
describes one type of Kata or Form.  Other forms are designed solely to
train people in the included skills and some to enhance stats and
endurance...  The Kata skill would refer to the type I first mentioned...

That said....

I think they are worth modeling.  The only ""transition"" mechanism in BARDIC
TALES is initiative.  There are three ways to make actions flow together
faster:
(1) Use a quickstrike skill for all your actions.  (Unlikely at best)

(2) Instant Attack all your actions.  This works but..... your first action
is at -40, your second at -60 and every one thereafter is at -60.  But the
beauty is you roll a 0 on your initiative roll and can use your whole SPD as
ACTION points.  The breakdown is that your perceptions are cut in half and
you are locked in to what you said you would do.  If you try to break the
chain you need to re-roll initiative as if surprised!!!( +12 to INIT)

(3) You could use pre-sets.  Pre-sets are a declared series of actions.  It
allows you to roll 2d6/2 for initiative instead of 2d6.   It is as Instant
Attack except that you roll as if you missed your last action(+4 INIT)
instead of being surprised if you break the chain.

What I did to start was I originally conceived Kata's as a pre-determined
series of  Instant Attacks,with it giving bonuses like a support skill(3%per
RANK) and 1 INIT point per RANK in Kata.    The Kata would be broken in to
series of 2-6 action sequences that were very pre-determined.  You had to
note what support skills you were using, which hex you were acting into, and
whether the action was low, high, or mid-level.  For every sequence you had
beyond the first in a single Kata you would take a -5% to the Kata's
difficulty factor.

Now- what that created was a thing that, as Jim has noted, a low-level
character could not use.  It only became useful when the characters chances
were high enough to overcome the Instant Attack Mods.  This models real life
I think - as any of you who have studied martial arts can attest- Kata are
not useful in practical fighting until you are really good.  Then many
high-level practitioners swear by them!

So that is the thought behind Kata.  I still think that this method models
the way Kata are most closely and keeps them form being too useful- if we
swapped the Instant Attacks into Pre-sets for instance a Kata is a great
support skill to have!!!!

Now- what I have done is run some numbers and the INIT bonus is probably too
gross as Pookie says below.  I would probably have it add 3% per RANK,  SPD
AND DAM like a secondary skill(I.e. (RANK-2)/2  instead of RANK)  to all
actions in the KATA.

PROPOSAL:  Have Kata be a support skill(I.e. above and beyond the
secondaries and generals) to all skills in its umbrella.  It will add 3% per
RANK to-hit, and  (RANK-2)/2  to SPD and DAM to all of its skills.  All the

to the activation roll of the Kata.

It is on a case by case basis I notice that I have not mentioned that in the

Not too gross-  it takes a RANK 10 Florentine to cancel out the init mods.
Too gross?

Yes- I realized afterwards that the Kata needs to be deifned while you have
RANK 0 in it so it was a silly rule.

Yes- that is exactly what happens.  The breaks between sequences re-set the
Instant Attack stream and allow you to break in or out of the Kata at no
penalty.

"RE: 6.1 Summary Post - 01/07/98 [KATA only]","Okay here's a question which is more about Instant Strike then about
Kata.

Preset gives me an INIT roll of 2d6/2, no minuses and bad things
happen if I change my mind.

Instant Strike gives me an INIT roll of 0, minuses of -40, -60 or -80
and bad things happen if I change my mind.

Worst case if I preset is that I will lose 6 INIT points compared to
the Instant Strike and average case is that I will lose 3.

As long as I have a speed of over 12 in this case INIT and ACT are
basically interchangeable.  So if those 6(or 3) INIT were extra speed
points, spending them mean I lose what would otherwise have been
a bonus of +12%(+6%).  If I needed these SPD points to reduce an
action then I will need to buy them back at a cost of -60%(-30%).

This means that the only time Instant Strike makes sense is if you
are Instant Striking a single action and you have really horrible dice
luck.  Otherwise why would I ever use Instant Strike?

>How about off-hand? -15%? R5.  I'm sure there are others . . .

Hmm.. ther eare a couple of potentially abusive ones like that: Called Shot
High(-20), Off-Hand(-20).  But I am willing to put up with those two.   Can
you come up with others?  The key is that I need to be really clear what are
support skills.
If someone say I want a linen-shirt wearing support skill then I need to
wake up.  :-)

I can handle that- if someone has Off-Hand sword at RANK 10, then they are
+10% better with their off-hand.  Shrug.  I can live with that.  If a crack
sniper (RANK 15) does a called shot high(-20) they are at plus 25% to-hit.
Again- it is on a small enough scale that I can take the few ones that don't
quite make it.  Same with Armour wearing.  Worse case- someone has Light
Armor wearing at RANK 15.  They put on a heavy leather haulberk(that is the
lightest thing classified as armor- anything lighter is unarmored).  This a
minus 10 to defense.  He gets a plus 35 to his defense for his armor wearing
skill.  Too much.  Maybe(he is rank 15- he probably is skilled in catching
the swords in that crease under his shoulder:-)) But again - not a system
buster.  Any other examples?

As I said above it is not perfect but i think it is acceptable.  Ummm.. what

think it will be a problem.

Here is where it starts getting dicey- Peter if you could chime in here
about high-level characters please...  For a high level character you would
not use Instant Attacks most of the time.  Unless: Your were wounded, tired,
missed your last action, etc. etc.  There are alot of variables that

that I owuld not recommend Instant attacks to them.  One high-level
character in training was told that hey needed to stop doing that, this it

Given that Kata in BT include 2-3 action sequences (Iajutsu draw/strikes or Fencing 
lunge/parry/thrust combinations )  I believe that the simpler katas are of use 
even to low level characters. Certainly many arts use simple sequences that 
don't qualify as Kata in the traditional asian martial arts styles but do qualify as
kata in BT. To insist that they are automatically instant attacks might make 
some sense if we were only talking about full forms but the simpler (Kyu Kumite) 
forms that I have used certainly don't automatically suffer from the -20,-60,80 
escalation. I have pushed the envelope a little and generated those minuses 
but it was a choice, not an automatic occurence.


Also, again, look at the numbers:

Primary Skills 		BC = 10%/RANK,  SPD = RANK - 2,  DAM =  RANK-2
Secondary Skills 	BC = 3%/RANK,  SPD = (RANK - 2)/2,  DAM =  (RANK - 2)/2
General Skills		BC = 3%/RANK,  SPD = (RANK - 2)/2,  DAM =  (RANK - 2)/2
Support			BC = 3%/RANK (sometimes)

No skill can appear in the Final Success chance more than once.


***

Menahan PCF 		Speed: 22
Katana R:13		SC=130%, SPD = 11
G:Nito-Kenjutsu R:8	SC=+24%, SPD=3
Secondary1: 8		SC=+24%, SPD=3
Secondary2: 8		SC=+24%, SPD=3

Current Total Speed Points for using Katana (Sans Kata):

SPD=22+3+3+3
SPD=31
Assuming average initiative rolls
SPD=31-7
SPD=24

With a total chance of 

SC=130+24+24+24
SC=202

==================================
Current Rev 6.0 model for Kata (from website)
==================================

Each different kata is a separate skill. The Kata skill gives 3%/RANKto-hit bonus to the skills within it and w would give [RANK] to the INIT all actions within the kata.

A kata can contain (DRIVE + KATA_RANK)/3 movements at no penalties. Any movement over that adds -10% to the difficulty of the kata. Kata are difficult to learn AND they
become more and more difficult based on how many moves they contain.

Kata act as a secondary to a specific set of sub-skills when those skills are used in a particular fashion and order. The sub-skills are pre-set strings, and are instant attacks (automatic 0
INIT roll, -40 to hit). It takes 4 counts to activate a kata (that can be sped up). The idea being, you have to upload the kata sequence into your forebrain.



Kata:Iajutsu R:8		

	4 cts to activate, cut down to 2

	SC=202+3*8-40=186%

	SPD= 24+8+7 (i.e. no roll for instant attack)
	SPD=39

	Breaking out cost +8 to init.
	
=====================================
Alex's Proposed Rev 6.1 model for Kata (from post)
======================================

PROPOSAL:  Have Kata be a support skill(I.e. above and beyond the
secondaries and generals) to all skills in its umbrella.  It will add 3% per
RANK to-hit, and  (RANK-2)/2  to SPD and DAM to all of its skills.  All the
Skills would be Instant Attacks, they would be organized into sequences of
2-5 actions with reactions in between.  The Kata would have to be activated
with a successful roll, though no crit would be possible as in all support
skills.   Every sequence written into a Kata beyond the first would add -10%
to the activation roll of the Kata.

Kata:Iajutsu R:8		

	4 cts to activate, cut down to 2	// Is this still the same ?

	SC=202+3*8-40=186% for the first
	SC=202+3*8-60=166% for the second
	SC=202+3*8-80=146% for the third

	SPD= 24+3+7 (i.e. no roll for instant attack)
	SPD=34

	 Breakout +12 to INIT


===============================================
Jim's proposal (from post)
==============================================-
Equivelant to doing a sustained series of presets with Kata as an additional secondary

+3%/Rank,DAM=(Rank-2)/2, SPD=(Rank-2)/2.

Perceptions other than PCF Perception cut in half for presets.

Kata:Iajutsu R:8		

	4cts=>2cts activation

	SC=202+3*8=226%

	SPD=31+3-(average roll of 3.5 or 4)
	SPD=30

	 Breakout +8 to INIT

===============================================
Doing a sustained series of presets with Kata as just a support skill
==============================================-

+3%/Rank

Perceptions other than PCF Perception cut in half for presets.

Kata:Iajutsu R:8		

	No activation

	SC=202+3*8=226%

	SPD=31-(average roll of 3.5 or 4)
	SPD=27

	 Breakout +8 to INIT


==================================
Summary.
==================================

I can't really see why anyone would bother using 
Alex's Proposed Rev 6.1 model for Kata (from post). 
Most characters both high level and low level would 
be better off doing a sustained series of presets. 

No activation, the breakout costs are cheaper, the chances are much 
better and the speed is almost the same. If I choose to use SC to buy speed 
a -40 will generate 4 ACT for a total SPD of 31 and a total SC=186%.

The only disadvantage is the cut in perception. ","Jim Jackl-Mochel","jmochel@foliage.com","SMTP","'Alexander M.

To which I reply.. huh?  I think it is an argument for Kata being Instant
Attacks.  I am trying to model how Kata are in realit not create a
super-optimized combat all-pupose support skill.  One of the disadvantages
of Kata are that they are pre-formatted , locked techniques.  The advantage
is you roll a 0 on your inititive dice between each action and get a free
RANK*3 added to all your skills in that sequence.  WHat a bargain!  If you
make them pre-sets you have to ask what is different from just doing the
actions?  What are we modeling?   Note that in real life everyone does not
use Kata, and only highly trained people use them in combat- and even then
in a limited manner.  Why make it something a first level character would
do?  Breaks concept.

Thoughts?

My problem is not whether they are highly optimized but whether I
would use them at all.  It would only be useful to model a feature
if someone is going to use it in play.  Much as I like the concept of
Kata it would not be worthwhile for me to get a zero initiative roll at
what would end up being a cost of -80+RANK*3 for most of my
actions.  It would make more sense for me to not use the skill,
consistently do a bunch of presets on the same actions and call it
""a Kata"".  Sigmund is not doing Kata in order to reflect some special
training mode.  He merely has basically one Kata because there is
a group of actions which he commonly performs together and I wanted
to model him having special expertise in this.  If there is not an
effective way to do it I can just continue to do the same thing and
assert that I am a ""specialist at this form of attack"" as a role-playing
character element.

To which I reply.. huh?  I think it is an argument for Kata being Instant
Attacks.  I am trying to model how Kata are in realit not create a
super-optimized combat all-pupose support skill.  One of the disadvantages
of Kata are that they are pre-formatted , locked techniques.  The advantage
is you roll a 0 on your inititive dice between each action and get a free
RANK*3 added to all your skills in that sequence.  WHat a bargain!  If you
make them pre-sets you have to ask what is different from just doing the
actions?  What are we modeling?   Note that in real life everyone does not
use Kata, and only highly trained people use them in combat- and even then
in a limited manner.  Why make it something a first level character would
do?  Breaks concept.

Thoughts?

Jim's number's are effectively true for someone whose speed is high enough
to not have a positive initiative.  Low level character's do get a benefit
out of instant attack in that they roll a 0 initiative automatically.

I talked to Jim last night and there were some unclarities  he had:

When you start a sequence of attacks, the first attack is obviously not an
instant attack- you just reacted before it.  The next action is your first
Instant Attack(I.e. attack with no initiative roll).  So the mods are
+0, -40, -60, -80.  SO you don't get the -80 until your fourth attack.

I have also looked at Instant Attack and part of the problem is that people
may be right in that it is too harsh.  It may be more appropriate to do
something like -30, -45, -60; or -40, -50, -60.
PROPOSAL 1: Instant attacks are attacks in which the initiative roll is
automatically adjusted to 0.  It is declared at a reaction, a normal attack
is launched and then the next attack begins the sequence with an INIT roll
of 0 .  The penalties are -40 for the first instant attack, -50 for the next
one, and -60 for all following instant attacks.
As with pre-sets the actions must be declared at the reaction.  Each action
must be specifically declared.  One can declare up to (RANK + DRIVE/3)
actions.  Recurring loops are possible.  For instance: I block high and then
I hit him again and again and again and don't stop till he is dead......

The other point that Jim made that I could actually buy was that it wasn't
broke when we had one INIT per RANK.  Why change it.  So let us look at this
option:

PROPOSAL 2:

Have Kata be a support skill(I.e. above and beyond the secondaries and
generals) to all skills in its umbrella.  It will add 3% per RANK to-hit,
and  RANK in INIT to all of its skills.  All the Skills would be Instant
Attacks, they would be organized into sequences of 2-5 actions with
reactions in between.  One could enter or leave a sequence at the reactions
in-between and those reactions re-set the Instant Attacks. The Kata would
have to be activated  with a successful roll, though no crit would be
possible as in all support skills.   Every sequence written into a Kata
beyond the first would add -10% to the activation roll of the Kata.
Breaking the Kata at a non-reaction carries a +8 penalty. (double the
penalty for missing a normal action.)

Thoughts on both proposals please...?   When I get enough answers I will
post a second summary posts with the changes and stuff.

Still hating Kata but thinking they are worth modeling anyway.

[Myth]

That's no reason to make them unusable.

Maybe you should just eliminate them.  We can
get by with a series of presets if we have to.

At least I, the non-kata-using public, can.

Begging the almighty GM's pardon, but I do not think the 
clarity of that is as obvious as it might seem to the one 
who designed the system in the first place.

I, for instance, would have thought that the kata, like a preset,
would have to be declared in the action before.  Thus:

React.  Declare action.  Declare kata starting after normal action.
Act.
Start kata with instant attack.

Instead, we seem to have this:

React.  Declare action (kata).
Act. (1st move)
Continue kata with instant attack.

This is, by the way, another advantage kata have over
sequencial presets.. it is easier to flow into them.

I like the second set much better on a purely emotional basis.
-45 is just too weird.

Um, is this for non-kata instant attacks?  'Cause it just countered 
everything the esteemed Jackl-Mochel allegedly got wrong about 
kata if it includes them.

Hmm.

Is there a good reason for a kata NOT to be a General skill?
That would provide the same rank and init bonuses, and the
limits on actions are similar to the limits on what a General
skill can cover.

Aside from that, and to reiterate:

Kata are composed of a number of sequences.
Each sequence has 2-5 actions.
Each sequence is treated as a series of instant attacks.
The first action of a sequence is a normal attack.
Breakout can occur between sequences, or with a penalty.
Katas are 'simple activation' skills, with no crit potential.
Kata skills add 3% per rank to all actions in the kata.

You know, all that seems reasonable.  I'm not sure as I'd
spend the EPs to get one at rank 10, but I don't see the 
model as seriously flawed or anything.

Here are my reactions and comments to all the current hot topics.

Endurance:
   Whatever

Katas:
   Whatever

Speed & Damage Tradeoff:
   I like the idea of being able to trade damage and speed, and Mark's example
of a quick poke in the eye seems true to life.  The problem with this tradeoff
is easy to see with missle weapons, but I am not familiar with melee weapon
damages enough to say.  Could you do the same damage as quickly with an axe and
a short sword for example? (chosen arbitrarily-- the point is you would need to
take a careful look at balancing weapon speeds and damages with this rule in
place).
   Another problem I see is that Stephen can now rack up 50 speed points with
pistol, and somebody could presumably get to the same levels with melee
weapons.  Do you really want somebody even at this high level doing a normal
speed strike doing +25 or +50 damage because they have quick reaction speeds?
Even though over half of this speed comes from LVF and skill, they already
contribute to damage--this could be the same as adding 1.5 or 2 point of damage
per rank instead of one PLUS a damage reward for natural base reaction speed! 
And is that before critical effects?!?
   If you do decide to keep this I would make it 2 SPD = 1 DAM at a bare
minimum, probably more like 5 SPD = 1 DAM.  If you need to draw a line for which
attacks can use this tradeoff I would say only those that use the attackers
power as the main damage (those that get the character's damage bonus).

Support Skills:
   I have no problem at all with support skills adding to your chance beyond the
penalties they cover.  I agree with Alex that his job is to keep them in balance
so they are reasonable.  None of the examples I have seen so far bother me. 
Pookie's example of the rank 10 armour wearing in light armour reminds me of the
Olympic runner my dad always told me about who trained by running his trapping
lines in heavy boots and deep snow.  Remove all that resistance and he got a lot
faster--works for me.
   I think you will need to review all the penalties in light of the many
changes to support skills in rev 6.0 and rev 6.1.
   On a related note, will perceptions continue to be rolled as primary skills
to offset penalties (PCF perception vs. feint, MCF perception vs movement mods,
etc.)?  If not, you would need to create a whole new mechanism or drastically
change your modifiers that are offset by perceptions.","Geoffrey Hodge","ghodge@relay-1.ziplink.net","SMTP","Alexander M.

There is a certain elegance to your arguments.  Mark 's are similar- have
you been consulting with each other...:-)

I agree on almost all points.  I think two ACT=1 DAM is pretty good.  That
means for the same speed you could cut a weapons speed in half, you could
add 5 points of damage.  If Stephen put all his ACT into DAMAGE at that
ratio he would take 6 counts to fire and would do +25 damage.  Given that if
you use speed points you would fire normally at 1/8th the speed- 1 count
shots- you would fire six times in those six counts.  I don't have too much
of a problem with that.  Maybe 3 ACT=1 DAM.  and restrict it to muscle
powered weapons.

No you can still cut Movement mods in half with Targeting Perception and
nullify a feint with Combat perception.

Okay.  I am not sure whether I am on space drugs or not but here is an
example:

Bob the Paladin decided he wants to use his ""squish 'em, gish 'em, turn 'em""
Kata.

(1)He rolls a reaction.
He acts in 2 counts.
(2)When his action comes he says 'I activate ""squish 'em, gish 'em, turn
'em"" '.
He rolls his Kata skill as a Primary and succeeds.  He declares what
sequence he will use(this Kata only has one) and that he will start right
into the Kata. (SEE OPTION 2 BELOW)
It takes him 4 counts to do this. We are now on count 6.
(3)He takes the first action of the Kata without rolling intuitive.  He
automatically gets a zero and starts the action on count six.  He gets all
his SPD as ACT points and takes a -40(modified by RANK*3 in the KATA).  It
takes him 2 counts after ACT mods to squish.
(4) At count 8 he starts right into gishing.  It takes him 2 counts after
act mods and he takes a -50(modified by RANK*3 in the KATA).
(5)At count 10 he starts a turn.  It takes him five counts after ACT mods
and he is at a -60(modified by RANK*3 in the KATA).
(6)At count 15 the turn goes off and he rolls a reaction roll 3 seconds
after deciding to go into the Kata.

OPTION 2: After successfully rolling KATA, you can roll a reaction and then
act so that the first action of the Kata isn't at -40, it is as a normal
action, and the second action is the first instant attack.


Does this clarify my thinking at all?

          ON CRITICALS
>The only caveat with this is that it seems ambiguous to me what a
>0 level of critical means.
Okay.  This is, I think, a nomenclature problem. It is axiomatic to most
RPGs and realism simulations that there is a chance for particularly good
successes.  Out of this, the concept of ""criticals"" or ""success levels""
comes.
In BT the distinctions are now made along these breakpoints:

SN = Success number = number you need to roll to succeed in the skill
(RANK*10 + LVF + MODs, generated by final success chance...)
CSN = Critical Success Number = 1/4 of your SN.
SL = Success Level

Under the success number:  SL 1  skill applied,half-damage
Under half the SN:         SL 2        full-damage
Under quarter the SN(CSN): SL 3        1.5* damage
Under CSN-10:              SL 4        2* damage
Under CSN-20:              SL 5        2.5* damage
Under CSN-30:              SL 6        3* damage etc.

To get the damage modifier of a hit, divide the SL by 2.  That is the damage
multiplier.  This assumes you are using your SLs for damage/effect.  You
could also use them for reducing END cost, or increasing effect duration, or
effect control, or some other things I am sure you will all think of....

The SL is the amount {(CSN - number rolled)/10 + 3 [rounded down]} for all
successes below SL 2.

>Lets say that I punch and for some reason
>I want to reduce my endurance as well as upping my damage.  I
>roll a SL 2.  Now what can I do?  Can I allocate 2 levels to
>damage and 0 levels to reducing endurance?
Yes- Though, as is intuitively obvious(*GRIN*) 0 levels will get you no
result. :-) Example:
SN=100 so CSN=25.
I roll a 66.  This is a SL 1. One level of success.
I roll a 43.  That is a SL 2.  It is two levels of success to apply
to whatever I want.
I roll a 22.  That is a SL 3.  It is three levels of success to play
with.  I could put one to Endurance(2/3 cost) and two to damage(full
damage).
I roll a 13.  That is a SL 2.  It is three levels of endurance to
play with.  I could put two to damage(1.5 times damage) and one to
endurance(2/3 cost).

--- --- ---
          ON ENDURANCE
In this conversation Physical and Mental Endurances are equivalent.
Therefore we refer to END and EXT- but these refer to both Physical
Endurance(END) and Mental Endurance(MEN).  Likewise for exhaustion.
Physical and Mental endurance and exhaustion are recovered simultaneously
and identically.
Currently END, EXT, and M-EXT (Endurance, Exhaustion, and Meta-Exhaustion)
use the idea that Endurance is like a pool of energy that you have a certain
amount of and that increases as one becomes more skilled.  Actions use up
Endurance like fuel.
ENDURANCE:  Basic ""fuel unit"".
It returns after use at 1 per ten counts... usually all back in 3-5 minutes.
Resting or sleeping doubles the return rate.
EXHAUSTION: EXT comes off the top of END at a rate of 1 per 10 END expended.
It returns at 1 per two hours of rest, 2 per hour of light sleep, 4 per hour
of medium sleep, and 8 per hour of full deep sleep.  Meals can also restore
1-3 EXT three times a day.  Meditation is as medium sleep.
META-EXHAUSTION: M-EXT comes off END as well.  One accumulates one M-EXT for
every 10 EXT one accumulates.
It returns at a rate of: 1 per 4 hours of complete rest(not doing any
activity- not expending more than 20 endurance in an hour), 1 per 2 hours of
deep sleep(Deep sleep is usually achieved in the third hour of sleep)
Your first hour of sleep is light sleep and gives you 2 EXT, .25 M-EXT
Your second hour of sleep is medium sleep and gives you 4 EXT,.25 M-EXT
All following hours of sleep are deep sleep and give you 8 EXT,.5 M-EXT

If a character is moving or acting at some percentage of full effort
(travelling with slower companions, taking their time, only punching white
belts) they only expend that percentage of the END cost of the action.  I.e.
if a character has a walk of 1.4 and the group is moving at .7, she only
expends 50% of the END cost for that type of movement.
Levels of critical can be used to decrease endurance cost just like they can
be used to increase damage.  The following table describes the effect:
     Effect of Success Levels on Endurance
1 x2/3
2 x1/2
3 x2/5
4 x1/3
5 x2/7
6 x1/4
...
NOTE: In most cases you need to put at least one success level in a roll to
effect or there will be 0 effect.  :-)  So usually you would never put all
your success levels towards reducing endurance.
Optional Rule: whenever the rules call for recovering 1 ENDURANCE or
EXHAUSTION it is read as 1% of the character's END or EXT.  The amount of
END or EXT recovered is tallied and then the modifier is applied.
I.e. if a character recovers 54 points over night, then that is translated
to 54% of total and rounded up to the nearest integer.
This rule will probably be used by characters with ENDURANCES over 100...
:-)
--- --- ---
          ON SPEED
Speed Points(SPD) => the number generated by the character's PSPD/MSPD stat,
plus the LVF/10, plus the RANK modifiers: primary(RANK-2),
secondaries([RANK-2]/2), and general([RANK-2]/2), plus any SPECIAL
POINTS(Support skills like Quickstrike, Environmental variables)
Initiative points(INIT) => the number subtracted from the characters
initiative roll.  Usually half the speed points, rounded up. Can be added to
directly by SUPPORT SKILLS like Kata.
Action Points(ACT) => the points used to speed up actions, perform passive
actions or set-up.  Usually half the speed points, rounded down. Can be
added to directly by some SUPPORT SKILLS like Quickdraw
Negative initiative would turn into ACT on a 1 per 1 basis.
Quickstrike would generate 1 SPD per RANK.    Kata would generate 1 INIT per
RANK.  A specific Quickdraw skill would generate 1 ACT per RANK.
To buy 1 ACT => 10% to-hit or 3 points of damage(only for muscle-power
weapons) or 1 negative initiative
One ACT will buy you:  2%-to-hit or 1/3 DAM or 1 count off of a passive
action (perception(8 counts), support skill initiation(usually 8 counts),
general skill activation(usually 8 counts, Kata is 4 counts), etc.) So 8
ACTION points will buy you a full passive perception or general skill
activation.
--- --- ---
          ON SETUP
Set-up in real counts will give you 5% per count and is limited to:
(1) 10 + KIF/2 counts of set-up AND
(2) a maximum value equal to  (RANK*10+LVF)- or the default value(saves,
MAP, etc.)- of the skill being set-up for.
Do not include secondaries or generals in set-up base chance and do not
include the difficulty of the skill.  Only include the RAW SUCCESS CHANCE:
RANK*10 + LVF.  This is because the more difficult actions are where set-up
is really needed and IMO makes the most difference in real-life.
The set-up skill allows you to double the set-up bonus per count for the
first RANK counts of set-up.

--- --- ---
          ON SUPPORT SKILLS
You may no longer roll against support skills.  They give their
3% per rank or 1 SPD point per rank and that is it.  This change alleviates
two problems:
(1) People have been getting high bonuses because they are criticalling
their support skill rolls.  This is often because of level factor and other
bonuses that already give to the primary skill, so they are redundant
bonuses.
(2) This change reduces the number of rolls people have to make in play.
Your quickstrike just adds Rank in SPD points to your action.  Period!  Your
florentine gives you 3% per rank- period.  No need to do another roll- no
need to recalculate for levels of success, etc.
This is a blessing for people with low ranks because it means you don't fail
your roll either- you always get 6% for your rank 2 support skill!:-)
Support skills can go above the negative modifier for a skill. (I.e. a RANK
15 Florentine character gets +45% and the minus is only minus 40%.  This
person is 5% better florentining than not florentining.)
You may use as many support skills as applicable skills you are using.  If
you have unused support skills they may be used as secondaries.

Whenever it is not stated what the contribution of a secondary, support or
general skill  is- but you know it makes a contribution- you can assume it
contributes:
3% per RANK to-hit
(RANK - 2)/2 to SPD
(RANK - 2)/2 to DAM
Note that some support skills do not contribute to-hit or def: Quickstrike,
Quickdraw
Some do not contribute to SPD: Called Shot, Feint, Set-Up, Evasion,  Armor
Wearing, Great Blow
Some do not contribute to  DAM: Called Shot, Quick Strike, Quick Draw,
Feint, Parry, Set-up. Evasion, Armor Wearing, Instant Attack, Great Blow
ON INSTANT ATTACK
Instant attacks are attacks in which the initiative roll is
automatically adjusted to 0.  It is declared at a reaction, a normal attack
is launched and then the next attack begins the sequence with an INIT roll
of 0 .  The penalties are -40 for the first instant attack, -50 for the next
one, and -60 for all following instant attacks.  As with pre-sets the
actions must be declared at the reaction.  Each action must be specifically
declared.  One can declare up to (RANK + DRIVE/3) actions.  Recurring loops
are possible.  For instance: I block high and then I hit him again and again
and again and don't stop till he is dead......

ON KI FOCUS
Ki Focus is a separate skill that has no speed effects.  It takes
10 counts to do, and is good for one action.  It allows the user to pour
KI(MEN) into damage and to-hit chance.  The to-hit bonus for this will also
be limited to the raw SC=> (RANK*10+LVF) or the max damage of the attack.
Adds RANK/4 to-hit or RANK/8 in damage per MEN used.
It is also a prerequisite for several ""monkish"" skills: Body Control, Iron
Skin, Reduce Exhaustion.
ON Mage Trance, Battle Trance, Ki Trance etc.
These also cannot be criticalled- They will make perceptions and all
applicable skills easier (15% + 3% per rank).  When a trance is induced a
specific perception is activated.  You must roll to enter a trance.  It
takes 30 counts, and no crit effects can be used for to-hit modification.
The pluses here are also limited to the raw success chance of the primary
skill being modified.
ON Katas
Have Kata be a support skill(I.e. above and beyond the secondaries and
generals) to all skills in its umbrella.  It will add 3% per RANK to-hit,
and RANK in INIT to all of its skills.  All the Skills would be Instant
Attacks, they would be organized into sequences of 2-5 actions with
reactions in between.  One could enter or leave a sequence at the reactions
in-between and those reactions re-set the Instant Attacks. The Kata would
have to be activated  with a successful roll, though no crit would be
possible as in all support skills.   Every sequence written into a Kata
beyond the first would add -10% to the activation roll of the Kata. Breaking
the Kata at a non-reaction carries a +8 penalty. (double the penalty for
missing a normal action.)
Summary:
Kata are composed of a number of sequences.
Each sequence has 2-5 actions.
Each sequence is treated as a series of instant attacks.
The first action of a sequence is a normal attack.
Breakout can occur between sequences, or with a penalty.
Katas are 'simple activation' skills, with no crit potential.
Kata skills add 3% per rank to all actions in the Kata.
Example:
Bob the Paladin decided he wants to use his ""squish 'em, gish 'em, turn 'em""
Kata.
(1)He rolls a reaction.
He acts in 2 counts.
(2)When his action comes he says 'I activate ""squish 'em, gish 'em, turn
'em"" '.  He rolls his Kata skill as a Primary and succeeds.  He declares
what sequence he will use(this Kata only has one) and that he will start
right into the Kata. (SEE OPTION 2 BELOW)
It takes him 4 counts to do this. We are now on count 6.
(3)He takes the first action of the Kata without rolling intuitive.  He
automatically gets a zero and starts the action on count six.  He gets all
his SPD as ACT points and takes a -40(modified by RANK*3 in the KATA).  It
takes him 2 counts after ACT mods to squish.
(4) At count 8 he starts right into gishing.  It takes him 2 counts after
ACT mods and he takes a -50(modified by RANK*3 in the KATA).
(5)At count 10 he starts a turn.  It takes him five counts after ACT mods
and he is at a -60(modified by RANK*3 in the KATA).
(6)At count 15 the turn goes off and he rolls a reaction roll 3 seconds
after deciding to go into the Kata.
OPTION 2: After successfully rolling KATA, you can roll a reaction and then
act so that the first action of the Kata isn't at -40, it is as a normal
action, and the second action is the first instant attack.

          APPENDIX 1
>From Jim Mochel on 1/5/98:
Ahh. This harkens back to the good old days of game design ! Here, for those
who never had to listen to me on this topic :-), is a quick summary of the
research I did for SH. Muscle fatigue models just as you might expect , with
expenditures of stored energy (stage 1) up to the point where the body
starts trying to bring in other energy reserves (stage 2) , then when those
are exhausted, continued exercise causes damage to the tissue (stage 3).
Stage 1 expenditures are gained back quickly (in hours) while stage 2
expenditures take days to recover from.
Fatigue from aerobic activity is related but not necessarily linked. As a
person starts exercising their breathing deepens to bring in more oxygen for
burning energy. This continues with the increase of activity until the point
where the respiratory system is no longer able to bring in enough oxygen
(the famous oxygen debt). At this point the body starts  burning stored
oxygen (in other forms). What differs for many activities is the percentage
of stored versus intake oxygen being used.
Sprinters go into oxygen debt very quickly and experience much less muscular
fatigue for a given event than marathon runners who expend a continuous but
small percentage of stored oxygen throughout the race. Muscular fatigue by
that time is often the main recovery item.
The oxygen pool does increase in size as a result of training but it is not
that elastic. The amount of stored oxygen is always a much smaller amount
than could be desired. Experienced athletes (Cyclists and Runners have been
extensively studied) simply expend less energy per action.
Oxygen debt is recovered very quickly (AKA Second Wind) (scale: minutes) but
you recover less effectively each successive time you blow through that pool
of energy.
Recovery from extended labor appears to be a _relatively_ constant value.
Oxygen debt recovers in minutes, stored muscular energy in days, damage in
weeks... And the variation is not that great between person to person.

"BT 6.11 summery","Read the 6.1 summery but before I could formulate a coherent well 
supported argument for my case the 6.11 rules came out.  So here is 
my rambling spur of the moment response. : )

Overall I think all of the changes are reasonable.  However here are 
a few comments and questions.

Endurance/ Exhaustion-  I still feel that some (but not all) skills 
should get automatic Endurance costs reductions that are based on RNK.
  I know Jim asked why have a rule that applies only to some skills 
and not others?  OK, Skills that are high endurance burners are 
logical targets.  One of the effects of improved RNK in a skill like 
running is a smoother more fluid style that wastes less energy.  This 
benefit seems to me to start from the lowest levels, the increased 
efficiency of a RNK 4 runner vs. an unskilled runner is huge.  But 
the current system gives the RNK 4 person only a 11% better chance to 
roll a critical than the unskilled runner with the same stats runner 
( I assumed AGFs of 12 and 8 ).  The additional END gained by the RNK 
4 is also minimal. In fact the numbers are so similar that a 
unskilled character with good stats could out run our ""professional 
level"" runner.  Wow!  I think clearly one of the benefits of training 
in movement has to be increased efficiency (reduced END costs).

So why do some skills get this bonus and not others?  Why not other 
high endurance burners like combat skills?  What I remember most 
about martial arts training is not the comfortable stances and energy 
conserving strikes ; ).  The strongest defensive stance or the blows 
that do the most damage are hardly ever the ones that conserve the 
most energy.  When in a fight energy conservation is pushed down on 
the priority list.  So those skills don't get this END rebate.
Keep in mind that as you improve in RNK in a weapon you receive some 
'free' benefits. Along with better chances to hit, you get improved 
SPD (or ACT I forget) and improved DMG.  Why not make the two 
benefits of some skills be increased effect and reduced energy costs? 
 After all what good is 5 speed points if you are running a 1/2 mile 
race?

I think a partial list of skills should include running, swimming, 
skating, rowing for physical as well as research, some rituals and 
chess for mental. Any others?

END recovery-
What happened to the 1 END or 1% whichever was higher (suggested by 
someone but I forget who) you don't want a character with a 34 END 
calculating with .34's. 

Setup - 
Can a person set up and Ki-focus? they seem to overlap a lot.

SPD / ACT Points to Damage-  The problem comes any time the is stored 
energy that causes the damage.  Keep the rules the same but disallow 
any attempt to convert stored energy to SPD points.  This would 
include the Desert Eagle, the dreaded ""Wand of Gishing"" that does +20 
damage, and the old fashioned muscle powered crossbow that still 
stores energy.

As for the rest I either don't remember enough to comment or didn't 
have an opinion either way.

"RE: Jack's comments on endurance","Even as I was writing my last proposal I knew there were some weak 
points.  Jack probably hit them all.

and...

These are the problems with saying this reduced energy cost works for 
some skills but not others.  If you don't buy the following arguments 
than I have to go with a universal system for all skills like JJM 
suggested in response to my first suggestion earlier in the week.  
But I still think there is merit to treating some skills different 
than others.  Here goes---

1) There is precedence in the system for different skills having 
different automatic effects.  See SPD in       the 6.11 revision for 
some examples.

2) The reduced endurance rules put in do allow a fighter to conserve 
endurance if she chooses, all I am      saying is that is not a 
default.  It is assumed when you fight that you do your best not to 
be hit and           that you try to do as much damage as possible as 
quickly as possible.  Thats what makes a good           warrior.

3) Note that the high level warrior is still conserving energy.  
Compare how much energy it takes Kay vs.      Adrienne to kill four 
Orcs (assuming she could) : ).  Kay activates his defense for 12 
counts, makes      four 3 count swings reacting instantly between 
each swing.  Four dead orcs, very efficient total      endurance cost 
less than 10.  Four Adrienne to kill the same orcs would be a long 
fight involving many      different blows, dodges, parrys etc burning 
endurance for her defense the whole time.  I don't know      how much 
endurance I'd burn, but I know its not as efficient as Kay ( or any 
high RNK warrior).  Its not      that I don't agree with Jack that 
high level fighters conserve endurance when they fight, I just think  
    the system already models it.
    
p.s. Jack don't retire Kay, Adrienne will need someone to save her 
when the crusade falls apart deep in Bengali.

Okay.  So 1 SL can be used for...

1/2 base effect (ie- damage)
reduce endurance and unspecified amount
   (apparently 1/3rd, from the examples)
increase control by unspecified amount
increase duration by unspecified amount

>>Lets say that I punch and for some reason

>>damage and 0 levels to reducing endurance?
>Yes- Though, as is intuitively obvious(*GRIN*) 0 levels will get you no
>result. 

Questions:

1. When do you declare these uses of SL?  Theoretically, the decision 
   to do all these special things (half-damage, extra control, etc) is
   made before the act is attempted, which means declaring before the 
   roll. OTOH, this takes time (not needed if the roll fails), and 
   people don't really know what they're going to roll ahead of time.

2. If there is a known quantity for either endurance reduction, extra
   control, or extra duration, what is it?  (There doesn't have to be;
   if you are still trying to find a balance, but acknowledge that a 5
   is better than a 3 for reducing endurance, that's okay too.)

3. (I love these numbered things.) If a crit-fail increases reaction time,
   can we use a crit-success to reduce it?  (Effectively leaving us in 
   better position for the next skill use.)

4. (You're going to hate this one.) Are there ""Failure Levels"" for
   crit misses?  I can't see players declaring them often, but the 
   results of a crit miss might be determined by the attempted allocation
   of SL's.  Just something to think about.


>SN=100 so CSN=25.
>I roll a 66.  This is a SL 1. One level of success.

Agreed.  You can put it to damage (1/2 base effect), or use it elsewhere
and do no damage at all.  Limited tactical potential.

>I roll a 43.  That is a SL 2.  It is two levels of success to apply
>to whatever I want.

Agreed, though the example is not very helpful in displaying options.
You could act at full effect (base damage) and normal endurace cost,
or 1/2 effect and 2/3 endurance, for instance.

Better.  What if you put 2 levels to Endurance?

>I roll a 13.  That is a SL 2.  It is three levels of endurance to
>play with.  I could put two to damage(1.5 times damage) and one to
>endurance(2/3 cost).

Wrong.  SL 4.  ""Three levels of endurance""??

And we get the '3 SL to damage = 1.5 base damage' bit.. it is the 
closest to the ""old"" system.  Please explore the other options.

2 to damage (full effect) and 2 to endurance.
1 to damage (1/2 effect) and 3 to endurance.
2 to damage and 2 to control.

...If you want to skip the examples, I'm sure the rest of us will come 
up with plenty of them for you.

1. You know, I was looking for this earlier.

Lessee.. 

Add 2 to # of SL's
Multiply result by # of SL's
Subtract result of that from 1.

Odd, but it works for zero and will never give a zero result.
Works for me, unless someone has an easier-to-apply-on-the-fly one.

If you remove the 'rounding up' part, I like it better.

I'd also like it as a non-optional rule.  Why should a character with
a 50 END be fully restored afte a night's sleep while a character who
is much tougher (say, 150 END) be only about 1/2 recovered?

(That is an emotional rection only.  Intellectually, I can handle it, 
though it looks a little weird at the break-point.)

I like this, BTW.  Don't know if I said it before.

What about setup in unreal (negative initiative) counts?  Is that
still possible?  I know some characters (Marc, Margo) have abused 
it in the past...

No 'activation' roll?

This explains the 'kata' general skill thing.

This gives us, what-- three different skill roll mechanics?
1. 'Normal' roll - get crit effects.
2. 'Activation' roll only - no crit
3. 'Support' roll - no roll, just level effects.

I have no problem with this, but can we break it up along the other skill
variation?  All 'normal' skills get normal rolls, all general skills get 
activation rolls, all support skills get no rolls?  (Well, you've already
got the last one.. do the others follow too?)

Otherwise, you have a potential for nine different skill sub-types, and I
think that's overdoing it.


>(1) People have been getting high bonuses because they are criticalling

Good.

>(2) This change reduces the number of rolls people have to make in play.

Very good.

>This is a blessing for people with low ranks because it means you don't 
>fail your roll either- you always get 6% for your rank 2 support skill!:-)

Cool.

>Support skills can go above the negative modifier for a skill.

Nice to have explicitly stated.  You might want to mention GM veto for
'abusive' situations, or limit the overage to twice the modifier or 
something.

If someone (other than me) wants to crunch the numbers and see if that
would pay off for the small stuff (off-hand weapon, for example), it 
might 
turn out to be more expensive to do it that way than to simply raise the 
weapon skill.  I doubt it, but maybe.

>You may use as many support skills as applicable skills you are using.  If
>you have unused support skills they may be used as secondaries.

Secondaries?  That gives the same game effect as a support skill (3%/rnk).
How about Tertiaries?  That would at least provide a little incentive to 
use the techniques you have high rank in, rather than just learning them 
for the points.

Okay.  I see here that some skills are designed to contribute to only one 
section of the attack (Quickstrike helps SPD, Great Blow helps DAM).  
Thus it is logical that they have reduced effects (in this case, 0) one 
the other sections.

Are these contributions balanced?  Does a Quickstrike help out more with 
SPD than another support or secondary?

Okay.  This is a non-kata Instant Attack.
I have some questions on the react/act sequence, but they can wait.

This needs to be re-evaluated (or at least restated) in terms of the 
other stuff you have above,

1. You listed kata as a general skill.
2. Support skills don't roll.

Still good.


I'm goig to use your kata example to ask my questions about the 
act-react sequence.  I suspect I may be somewhat confused about
the entirety of the process.

>Example:
>Bob the Paladin decided he wants to use his ""squish 'em, gish 'em, turn 
>'em"" Kata.

Bob decides on action.

>(1)He rolls a reaction.

2d6; Bob rolls a 9. SPD with Kata is 14, half of that is 7, 9-7=2.

>He acts in 2 counts.

2 counts pass while Bob pulls himself together.

>(2)When his action comes he says 'I activate ""squish 'em, gish 'em, turn
>'em"" '.  

Declares action. (To GM; had already chosen it to get full SPD mods.)

Declaration: Activate kata, use first action of kata as instant.

>He rolls his Kata skill as a Primary and succeeds.  

Rolls skill.

>He declares what sequence he will use(this Kata only has one) and that he
>will start right into the Kata. (SEE OPTION 2 BELOW)

Your ""Instant Attack"" section specified declaring the Instant Action at
the reaction (twice).  This is not supported by your example.

>It takes him 4 counts to do this. We are now on count 6.

Action takes place.  If Kata is a general skill, Bob spect ACT points to 
reduce it. (He had 7.  4 would take it to 4 (it is a passive skill, either
as a general or a support skill), and he can use the others for a +6%.  
Doesn't really matter.)

4 counts pass.  

>(3)He takes the first action of the Kata without rolling intuitive.  

Instant attack, declared during previous action.

Reaction sequence goes here, zeroed because of instant attack-ness.

>He automatically gets a zero and starts the action on count six.  

Is that zero before or after applying his speed points?

Should be before, unless you want high-level character to avoid this 
stunt.  That would give Bob an extra +14% in his skill.

>He gets all his SPD as ACT points and takes a -40(modified by RANK*3 in the 
>KATA).  It takes him 2 counts after ACT mods to squish.

Okay,  You covered that point.  My apologies.

Another reaction, another zero result.

""Gish"" is predeclared as part of the kata.

>(4) At count 8 he starts right into gishing.  It takes him 2 counts after
>ACT mods and he takes a -50(modified by RANK*3 in the KATA).

Rect at zero, ""Turn"" predeclared.

>(5)At count 10 he starts a turn.  It takes him five counts after ACT mods
>and he is at a -60(modified by RANK*3 in the KATA).

>(6)At count 15 the turn goes off and he rolls a reaction roll 3 seconds
>after deciding to go into the Kata.

Sequence completes.  Bob reacts normally.

He could start a new sequence, leaving kata activated and taking no
penalty for his forst act (normal reaction) and -40% and -50% on the 
other two (second and third instant attacks).

If he had declared a preset before the ""Turn"" action, he could react 
faster here.


>OPTION 2: After successfully rolling KATA, you can roll a reaction and then
>act so that the first action of the Kata isn't at -40, it is as a normal
>action, and the second action is the first instant attack.

I think a preset would make more sense there.


As you may have gathered, I'm a little fuzzy on the fine detail of the 
react/act sequence.  Here is my understanding of it.

1. React  
    - Roll dice
    - Apply any penalty mods from contition or last action
    - Apply reaction mods (1/2 SPD), some based on intended action
    - Wait
2. Declare
    - Declare skill use
    - Figure time needed for skill use, including rest of mods
    - If planning a reduced-reaction action next, declare that too.
    - Wait
3. Act
    - When time comes, roll the skill.
    - React again, with preset or IA mods if appropriate.

Is that correct?

Whups.  I was thinking that it was a miracle because I understood the whole
thing.  But you lost me on that last one.  Why is a 13 a success level 2
rather than a success level 4 and why three levels rather than 2 (or 4) and

I may have missed this in the previous discussions, but I thought that
meditation allowed for recovering EXT at twice the sleep rate.  That meant
to me 4, 8, 16, 16, 16 etc. I assume that ""as medium sleep"" means 1st

I don't object to the 6 seconds that it takes to get into a trance, but
I've always thought that that time should be reduced by Rank in Meditation.
 And if you have to roll to enter trance, why can't you critical?  If you
can't apply a critical to the skill being modified, how about applying the
critical to reducing the time-to-trance.  My two cents.

Alex, when we spoke I got the impression that one could move from
mid-sequence to mid-sequence, even from one Kata to another, without
penalty, if the action that you just performed was the same in multiple
sequences.  ie. sequence one is A-C-D, sequence 2 is A-F-E.  declare

          ON CRITICALS/SUCCESS LEVELS

It is axiomatic to most RPGs and realism simulations that there is a chance
for particularly good successes.  Out of this, the concept of ""criticals"" or
""success levels"" comes.
In BT the distinctions are now made along these breakpoints:

SN = Success number = number you need to roll to succeed in the skill
(RANK*10 + LVF + MODs, generated by final success chance...)

CSN = Critical Success Number = 1/4 of your SN.

SL = Success Level

NOTE: In these discussions we will speak about damage and effect
interchangeably.  Mostly this is an artifact of the skill system growing out
of a gaming system that focused on modeling weapon effects.  However the
pluses to Damage(DAM), and the multipliers for effect are both modeling the
same area.  For purposes of weapons effect is damage and for purposes of
non-weapon skills DAM is the same as effect.

     Effect of Success Levels on Effect
Under the success number:  SL 1  skill applied,half-effect
Under half the SN:         SL 2        full-effect
Under quarter the SN(CSN): SL 3        1.5* effect
Under CSN-10:              SL 4        2* effect
Under CSN-20:              SL 5        2.5* effect
Under CSN-30:              SL 6        3* effect etc.

To get the damage modifier of a hit, divide the SL by 2.  That is the effect
multiplier.  This assumes you are using your SLs for effect.  You could also
use them for reducing END cost(see Endurance section for success level
effect on Endurance), or increasing effect duration(mechanism to be
determined), or effect control(mechanism to be determined), or some other
things I am sure you will all think of....

NOTE: It is advisable to always put at least one level of success into
effect/damage or you will have no effect!:-)(Although I can see in a
practice fight you might put all your success levels into endurance cost or
showmanship or something...)

4  +12     +6
5  +15     +7
6  +18     +9

NOTE:  ACT points from SL(SL*3) go toward the action (I.e. the character is
so successful and smooth with the action they can do it faster...).
INIT points from SL(SL*1.5, round down) go towards the reaction IMMEDIATELY
after the action (I.e. the character is so much smoother with the action
they can transition into the next action better.
...
The SL is the amount {(CSN - number rolled)/10 + 3 [rounded down]} for all
successes below SL 2.
Example:
SN=100 so CSN=25.
I roll a 66.  This is a SL 1. One level of success.
*
I roll a 43.  That is a SL 2.  It is two levels of success to apply
to whatever I want.  One could apply both levels to effect(full damage), OR
one level to effect(1/2 damage) and one level to reducing endurance(2/3
endurance cost).
*
I roll a 22.  That is a SL 3.  It is three levels of success to play
with.
I could put one to Endurance(2/3 cost) and two to effect(full
damage)
or all three to effect(1.5*damage)
or one to ACT points(3 points), one to Endurance(2/3 cost), and one to
Effect(.5*damage).
*
I roll a 13.  That is a SL 4.  It is four levels of success to
play with.  I could put three to effect(1.5*damage) and one to
endurance(2/3 cost), or one to effect(half damage) and three to
endurance(2/5 cost), etc.

          ON ENDURANCE

In this conversation Physical and Mental Endurances are equivalent.
Therefore we refer to END and EXT- but these refer to both Physical
Endurance(END) and Mental Endurance(MEN).  Likewise for exhaustion.
Physical and Mental endurance and exhaustion are recovered simultaneously
and identically.

Currently END, EXT, and M-EXT (Endurance, Exhaustion, and Meta-Exhaustion)
use the idea that Endurance is like a pool of energy that you have a certain
amount of and that increases as one becomes more skilled.  Actions use up
Endurance like fuel.

ENDURANCE:  Basic ""fuel unit"".
It returns after use at 1 per ten counts... usually all back in 3-5 minutes.
Resting or sleeping doubles the return rate.

EXHAUSTION: EXT comes off the top of END at a rate of 1 per 10 END expended.
It returns at 1 per two hours of rest, 2 per hour of light sleep, 4 per hour
of medium sleep, and 8 per hour of full deep sleep.  Meals can also restore
1-3 EXT three times a day.  Meditation is as medium sleep.

META-EXHAUSTION: M-EXT comes off END as well.  One accumulates one M-EXT for
every 10 EXT one accumulates.
It returns at a rate of: 1 per 4 hours of complete rest(not doing any
activity- not expending more than 20 endurance in an hour), 1 per 2 hours of
deep sleep(Deep sleep is usually achieved in the third hour of sleep)

Your first hour of sleep is light sleep and gives you 2 EXT, .25 M-EXT
Your second hour of sleep is medium sleep and gives you 4 EXT,.25 M-EXT
All following hours of sleep are deep sleep and give you 8 EXT,.5 M-EXT

If a character is moving or acting at some percentage of full effort
(travelling with slower companions, taking their time, only punching white
belts) they only expend that percentage of the END cost of the action.  I.e.
if a character has a walk of 1.4 and the group is moving at .7, she only
expends 50% of the END cost for that type of movement.

Levels of critical can be used to decrease endurance cost just like they can
be used to increase damage.  The following table describes the effect:
     Effect of Success Levels on Endurance
1 x2/3
2 x1/2
3 x2/5
4 x1/3
5 x2/7
6 x1/4
...
NOTE: In most cases you need to put at least one success level in a roll to
effect or there will be 0 effect.  :-)  So usually you would never put all
your success levels towards reducing endurance.

Optional Rule: whenever the rules call for recovering 1 ENDURANCE,
EXHAUSTION, or META-EXHAUSTION it is read as 1% of the character's
endurance.  The amount of endurance recovered is tallied and then the
modifier is applied.

I.e. if a character recovers 54 points over night, then that is translated
to 54% of total and rounded up to the nearest integer.

This rule will probably be used by characters with ENDURANCES over 100...
:-)

--- --- ---
          ON TIME
Managing flow of actions, sequencing of occurrences and time-flow in Bardic
Tale is modeled by breaking time up into discrete units called counts.  Each
count is the equivalent of a fifth of a second.

Then there is a system called ""initiative"" that manages when a character
acts and reacts in counts.  This is based on a series of variables including
the primary stats AGL, DSC, and INT; the secondary stats of Physical
Speed(PSPD) or Mental Speed(MSPD); the Total Level Factor of the
character(TLF); the Physical Level Factor(PLF) or Mental Level Factor(MLF),
and the Level Factor of the skill being used in the action.  This
""initiative"" also includes the person's RANK in the skill about to be used,
and on the similar skills supporting it, the character's physical
well-being, mental state, and other situational modifiers.  These variables
are all bundled together under a single number called SPD.

To simulate the variability of our interface with the world, the
""initiative"" is generated by rolling two 6-sided dice and adding them
together and then modifying them by SPD/2(rounded up).  The resultant number
is the number of counts a character must wait until they can start an
action.  This is their ""reaction time"" in counts.

During the course of a combat or specific interaction, the GM will walk
through time count by count. In each count there is an action phase and a
reaction phase.   When a person ""rolls initiative"" and generates a number,
that number is the number of counts the person takes to ""react"" to their
environment and start an action.  If the number is negative(due to
modifiers) then it is declared as zero counts.  This means that the person
can declare what action they are starting immediately and it will start in
the action phase of the next count.  All the negative initiative(plus
SPD/2[rounded down]) gets turned into ACTION POINTS, which can be used to
speed up the time it actually takes to do the action.

Then each action has a speed assigned to it.  This is called
WeaponSpeed(WSD- this is another layover from the time when all skills were
modeling combat!).  This speed is also a measure of the ""counts"" it takes to
perform the action.   So once the person is finished reacting they would
confirm which action they were taking during the action phase of that count.
That would be the first count of the action.  When they reach the action
phase of the count which is modified WSD counts later they would roll their
skill roll and the action would take place.

Some skill options that change this slightly are pre-sets and instant
attacks.  The only difference is that when using a pre-set you roll 2d6/2
instead of 2d6 for the reaction variation.  In an instant attack you proceed
as if you had ROLLED a 0[normally impossible] on your 2d6/2 pre-set roll.

SPEED mechanics are explained in more detail below.

--- --- ---
          ON SPEED

Speed Points(SPD) => the number generated by the character's PSPD/MSPD stat,
plus the LVF/10, plus the RANK modifiers: primary(RANK-2),
secondaries([RANK-2]/2), and general([RANK-2]/2), plus any SPECIAL
POINTS(Support skills like Quickstrike, Environmental variables, Physical
and Mental state of the character)

Initiative points(INIT) => the number subtracted from the characters
initiative roll.  It is equal to half the speed points, rounded up. Is added
to directly by some SUPPORT SKILLS like Kata.

Action Points(ACT) => the points used to speed up actions, perform passive
actions or add to-hit.  It is equal to half the speed points, rounded down.
Is added to directly by some SUPPORT SKILLS like Quickdraw

Negative initiative turns into ACT on a 1 per 1 basis.

Quickstrike generates 1 SPD per RANK.    Kata generates 1 INIT per RANK.  A
specific Quickdraw skill generates 1 ACT per RANK.

To buy 1 ACT => 10% to-hit or 3 points of damage(only for muscle-powered
weapons) or 1 negative initiative

One ACT will buy you:  2%-to-hit or 1/3 DAM or 1 count off of a passive
action (perception[8 counts], support skill initiation[usually 8 counts],
general skill activation[usually 8 counts, Kata{not a general skill but a
support skill that required activation} is 4 counts], etc.)
So 8 ACTION points will buy you a full passive perception or general skill
activation.

--- --- ---
          ON SETUP

Set-up in real counts will give you 5% per count and is limited to:

(1) 10 + KIF/2 counts of set-up AND

(2) a maximum value equal to  (RANK*10+LVF)- or the default value(saves,
MAP, etc.)- of the skill being set-up for.

Do not include secondaries or generals in set-up base chance and do not
include the difficulty of the skill.  Only include the RAW SUCCESS CHANCE:
RANK*10 + LVF.  This is because the more difficult actions are where set-up
is really needed and IMO makes the most difference in real-life.

The set-up skill allows you to double the set-up bonus per count for the
first RANK counts of set-up.

--- --- ---
          ON SUPPORT SKILLS

You may no longer roll against support skills.  They give their
3% per rank or 1 SPD point per rank and that is it.  This change alleviates
two problems:

(1) People have been getting high bonuses because they are criticalling
their support skill rolls.  This is often because of level factor and other
bonuses that already give to the primary skill, so they are redundant
bonuses.

(2) This change reduces the number of rolls people have to make in play.
Your quickstrike just adds Rank in SPD points to your action.  Period!  Your
florentine gives you 3% per rank- period.  No need to do another roll- no
need to recalculate for levels of success, etc.
This is a blessing for people with low ranks because it means you don't fail
your roll either- you always get 6% for your rank 2 support skill!:-)

Support skills can go above the negative modifier for a skill. (I.e. a RANK
15 Florentine character gets +45% and the minus is only minus 40%.  This
person is 5% better florentining than not florentining.)

NOTE: Some support skills must be rolled against as a primary to ""activate""
their effect.  This is a binary on/off roll- there is no critical possible
but the roll must be successful to use the support skill.  These activation
rolls typically take 4 counts.

You may use as many support skills as applicable skills you are using.  If
you have unused support skills they may be used as secondaries.

Whenever it is not stated what the contribution of a secondary, support or
general skill  is- but you know it makes a contribution- you can assume it
contributes:
3% per RANK to-hit
(RANK - 2)/2 to SPD
(RANK - 2)/2 to DAM

Note that some support skills do not contribute to-hit or def: Quickstrike,
Quickdraw

Some do not contribute to SPD: Called Shot, Set-Up, Evasion,  Armor Wearing,
Great Blow

Some do not contribute to  DAM: Called Shot, Quick Strike, Quick Draw,
Feint, Parry, Set-up. Evasion, Armor Wearing, Instant Attack, Great Blow

ON INSTANT ATTACK
Instant attacks are attacks in which the initiative roll is automatically
adjusted to 0.  It is declared at a reaction, a normal attack is launched
and then the next attack begins the sequence with an INIT roll of 0 .

The penalties are -40 for the first instant attack, -50 for the next one,
and -60 for all following instant attacks.  The first instant attack is
defined as the first attack to happen after the adjusted initiative.

As with pre-sets the actions must be declared at the reaction.  Each action
must be specifically declared.  One can declare up to (RANK + DRIVE/3)
actions.  Recurring loops are possible.  For instance: I block high and then
I hit him again and again and again and don't stop till he is dead......

ON KI FOCUS

Ki Focus is a separate skill that has no speed effects.  It takes 10 counts
to do, and is good for one action.  It allows the user to pour KI(MEN) into
damage and to-hit chance.  The to-hit bonus for this will also be limited to
the Raw SC=> (RANK*10+LVF) or the max damage of the attack.  Adds RANK/4
to-hit or RANK/8 in damage per MEN used.

It is also a prerequisite for several ""monkish"" skills: Body Control, Iron
Skin, Reduce Exhaustion.

ON TRANCES (MAGE, BATTLE, KI, etc.)

These also cannot be criticalled- They will make perceptions and all
applicable skills easier (15% + 3% per rank).  When a trance is induced a
specific perception is activated.  You must roll to enter a trance.  It
takes 30 counts, and no crit effects can be used for to-hit modification,
although you could use the success levels for other things...

The pluses here are also limited to the raw success chance of the primary
skill being modified.

ON KATA

A Kata is a support skill(I.e. above and beyond the secondaries and
generals) to all skills in its umbrella.  It adds 3% per RANK to-hit, and
RANK in INIT to all of its skills.  All the actions in the Kata are done as
Instant Attacks.

They are organized into ""sequences"" of 2-5 actions with reactions in
between.  One can enter or leave a sequence at the reactions in-between and
those reactions re-set the Instant Attacks. Breaking the Kata at a
non-reaction, or in the middle of a sequence,  carries a +8 penalty to the
character's next INIT (double the penalty for missing a normal action).

The Kata would have to be activated with a successful roll, though no crit
would be possible as in all support skills.  It takes 4 counts to activate a
Kata. Every sequence written into a Kata beyond the first adds -10% to the
activation roll of the Kata.

Summary:
Kata are composed of a number of sequences.
Each sequence has 2-5 actions.
Each sequence is treated as a series of instant attacks.
The first action of a sequence is a normal attack.
Breakout can occur between sequences, or with a penalty.
Katas are 'simple activation' skills, with no crit potential.
Kata skills add 3% per rank to all actions in the Kata.

BEGIN EXAMPLE:

Bob the Paladin decides he wants to use his ""squish 'em, gish 'em, turn 'em""
Kata.

COUNT 0
(1)He rolls a reaction.  He acts in 2 counts.

COUNT 2
(2)When his action comes he says 'I activate ""squish 'em, gish 'em, turn
'em"" '.  He rolls his Kata skill as a Primary and succeeds.  He declares
what sequence he will use(this Kata only has one) and that he will start
right into the Kata. (SEE OPTION 2 BELOW)
It takes him 4 counts to do this.

COUNT 6
(3)He takes the first action of the Kata without rolling initiative.  He
automatically gets a zero and starts the action on count six.  He gets  all
his SPD as ACT points and takes a -40(modified by RANK*3 in the KATA).  It
takes him 2 counts after ACT mods to squish.

COUNT 8
(4) He starts right into gishing.  It takes him 2 counts after ACT mods and
he takes a -50(modified by RANK*3 in the KATA).

COUNT 10
(5)He starts his 10-count ""Prot Vs. Nasties"".  It takes him five counts
after ACT mods and he is at a -60 (modified by RANK*3 in the KATA).

COUNT 15
(6)He rolls his Turn successfully and the turn goes off and he rolls a
reaction roll- now 3 seconds after deciding to go into the Kata in the first
place.

OPTION 2: After successfully rolling KATA, you can roll a reaction and then
act so that the first action of the Kata isn't at -40, it is as a normal
action, and the second action is the first instant attack.

ON FEINTS

A feint is a false attack designed to create an opening in an opponent's
defense. It is a contest between the feinter's skill at feint and the
opponent's perception. The formula for the success of a feint is:

FSC = (Feinter's RANK in weapon being used)*10 + LVF + MODS + (Feinter's
RANK in Feint)*3

The success of the feint is based on the Success Level of the Opponent's
Perception roll.  How well the feinter succeeded is then subtracted from
their opponents perception.

The feint takes weapon speed(WSD) of the weapon used divided by two in
counts to execute.

A successful feint adds 40% to-hit, halves opponent's defense, and increases
ACT by 10.

An unsuccessful feint subtracts 40% to-hit, and minus 8 from the feinter's
next INIT.

If the attacker had failed his feint AND the defender had still badly failed
his per roll, then the blade would still be drawn away but the attacker
would only be at -20% to-hit and minus 4 to the next INIT.

The feinter then rolls reaction as per pre-set and attacks.

Here is an example of Bob the Paladin feinting:

BEGIN EXAMPLE
(BOB finishes up an action and announces he is going to feint with his
sword.)

COUNT 0
BOB: I am going to feint.
(He rolls initiative, modified by his skill in feint with sword as a
secondary OR sword with feint [feint adds {RANK-2}/2 to SPD when used as a
support skill])
BOB: I will react in 2 counts!

COUNT 2
GM: There is a possible opening to the shoulder. (Generated by random
location chart)
Bob: I feint an attack to the shoulder to draw his weapon away from his
head. (Bob determines his sword feint-at half his normal weapon speed, then
modified by his ACT points- will take 2 counts)

COUNT 4
(Bob rolls his feint.  GM rolls defenders perception modified by the
attacker's feint success.  In this case, the defender fails.)
GM: An opening appears at the defender's head.
(Bob determines how long his real attack takes including the feint mods
etc-say 3 counts-)
Bob: I attack and will hit in 3 counts!

COUNT 7
Bob: I roll to hit. (Bob rolls to-hit at called shot minuses for head but at
plus 40 for the successful feint and only taking half the defender's
defense.)   I hit!!!  Yea!!!!
(Bob rolls reaction to do some new action that he announces now.  If he had
failed the feint he would have to add 8 points to his INIT on this roll....)

END EXAMPLE

--- --- ---
         ON MOVEMENT MODS

It is exceedingly difficult to target an opponent that is moving.
Therefore these are the mods:

If you are moving at all: -40% to-hit
(Possible support skill: Shoot-While-Move.  Adds 3% per rank to your shot.)

If your target is moving at all: -40% to-hit
(Possible support skill: Targeting Perception.  If you make an ACTIVE
targeting perception- I.e. follow the target, lead the target- that is
successful you cut all the target based movement mods in half- including the
velocity differential.)

For every foot per count your velocities are different: -10% to-hit.
(NOTE: If the velocity differential is at a significant angle- less than 45
degrees- then you may reduce the minuses in direct relation to the angle*2
as a percentage.  I.e. If it is at 45 degrees then you can  take 90% of the
velocity differential minuses[9% per ft/ct instead of ten]. If it is heading
straight towards or straight away it is 0% and you take no velocity
differential but still take the opponent moving mod.)

An opponent is defined as moving if they:
(a) have a velocity greater than 1 ft/count, or
(b) are engaged in a maneuver skill of some sort (dodge, acrobatics,
gymnastics, running, swimming, falling, actively riding).  Climbing or
defense is usually not counted unless the climber/defender can fulfill
condition (a).

Another mod is ""Unstable Platform"": -40%.  Includes: moving cars,
helicopters, crumbling/unsteady standing/kneeling/lying surface

          APPENDIX 1
>From Jim Mochel on 1/5/98:

Ahh. This harkens back to the good old days of game design ! Here, for those
who never had to listen to me on this topic :-), is a quick summary of the
research I did for SH. Muscle fatigue models just as you might expect , with
expenditures of stored energy (stage 1) up to the point where the body
starts trying to bring in other energy reserves (stage 2) , then when those
are exhausted, continued exercise causes damage to the tissue (stage 3).
Stage 1 expenditures are gained back quickly (in hours) while stage 2
expenditures take days to recover from.

Fatigue from aerobic activity is related but not necessarily linked. As a
person starts exercising their breathing deepens to bring in more oxygen for
burning energy. This continues with the increase of activity until the point
where the respiratory system is no longer able to bring in enough oxygen
(the famous oxygen debt). At this point the bodystarts burning stored oxygen
(in other forms). What differs for many activities is the percentage of
stored versus intake oxygen being used.

Sprinters go into oxygen debt very quickly and experience much less muscular
fatigue for a given event than marathon runners who expend a continuous but
small percentage of stored oxygen throughout the race. Muscular fatigue by
that time is often the main recovery item.

The oxygen pool does increase in size as a result of training but it is not
that elastic. The amount of stored oxygen is always a much smaller amount
than could be desired. Experienced athletes (Cyclists and Runners have been
extensively studied) simply expend less energy per action.

Oxygen debt is recovered very quickly (AKA Second Wind) (scale: minutes) but
you recover less effectively each successive time you blow through that pool
of energy.
Recovery from extended labor appears to be a _relatively_ constant value.
Oxygen debt recovers in minutes, stored muscular energy in days, damage in
weeks... And the variation is not that great between person to person.

"RE: Jack's comments on endurance","Jack writes:
>how much does a fighters endurance grow with combat...furthermore 
how

I believe that the 2*PCF added to the character's general endurance 
is about right for 
how much a fighter's general endurance increases with level, I don't 
believe that a high
level swordsman should be able to run for longer than a high level 
runner.  Yes, the 
system as it stands now would let the high PCF character run longer. 

As for how much a fighters effective endurance in a fight grows, I 
think my example of 
comparing the endurance spent by a high level fighter vs. a low level 
fighter on the same 
task is still valid.  If it takes 1/2 the time and 1/2 the swings 
isn't that the same as having
twice the endurance? (better really).

As for strength increasing, I have no problem with weapon damage 
increasing 
I think it should, so that models greater strength for that one 
weapon, but not 
for all weapons.

>Does the system model fighting champions who fought all day?... like 
in the Trojan War
>for example?

Your point about the Trojan War Champions brings to mind Hector's 
fight 
against Achilles.  Achilles let Hector (who wore heavy armor) chase 
him 
around Troy three times in order to tire him out, before he turned to 
fight.  
Of course it didn't work for Achilles, (that heel thing just killed 
him :-)  ) but 
it shows that even the greatest heroes of the Trojan war had to think 
in 
terms of using and conserving endurance.

>I'm simply not convinced that the system takes into account the high 
level
>of general fitness that any mid level warrior would naturally attain.


I've never seen characters with high PCF's run into endurance 
problems in BT
I think those characters have an advantage over all others.  Does it 
make sense
to you that a warrior can run for a longer time than someone with the 
same number 
and RNKs in movement skills?

Does anyone know anything about boxing?  It seems to me that this may 
be our best 
model of a test of how much endurance a fighter might have to burn 
through.  I also
think the 3 minute burst of high energy use followed by a 1 minute 
break ten times in 
a row is a pretty good example of what a nasty battle would be like. 


>I would love to see Jim's energy graph

I'll look, but if the changes needed to make the system work means
reworking all the Damage plusses and WPS modifiers just to 
accomadate
a reduced endurance cost I don't think it's worth it.  Why not just 
adjust the 
system where the problem is:

Give automatic endurance cost reductions to those skills that use a 
lot of 
energy without recieving other bonuses already.  See previous posts 
for details.

How can ACT points be applied? Pretty much everyone I know rolls their
action when it ends . . .  do we start rolling actions when they begin
now?  Can I still convert ACT to plusses to hit? If so, do I make a
roll, get two levels of crit, convert to ACT, covnvert to plusses, and
push myself down another level of crit? (I know, its weird)

1) We have just been completely through several ""things"" that are all
modified by SL. I think that Feint should be in the same category.
Effect should be determined by the spread on the compared SLs.
2) I don't believe that a failed Feint should penalize more than a
standard action- if anything, less- it is a lower commitment action. The
penalty is inherent in your opponent reading your next attack and
knocking your block off.

So- maybe something like . . . (I'm typing out loud here, bear with me.)

Roll Feint as above. Succeed ON YOUR OWN to do the attack without
negative mods from own clumsiness. Neg mods would be less than those
from a normal missed action.

Roll opponents perception. MUST be rolled as at least a passive, even if
the opponent would not normally get a roll? Otherwise fast feints don't
work. Normal minuses for depth of action to perception applicable?
Compare SLs to Feinters SLs.  

Whatever SLs are left go to the Feinter, + or -, for his attack. If the
levels are 0, then the Defender knows that it is a Feint. For each
negative level, step down the normal Combat Perception chart for what
the defender knows about the forthcoming attack.

What do you think? It is not as gross, but I think it fits the game
mechanics a lot better, and it is really gross when you have a big level
differential, or a good roll. Also, it takes into account the case where
the Defender simply ignores the Feint- they can still try to do
something active against the true attack, but the Feinter will still be
at significant plusses. Come to think about it more, I'm not sure it is
less gross..... it might actually make it worthwhile to feint again,
even for Chuck! ;-)

I would not have given you set up.  Trigger pull on a semi-auto pistol is a
2/5 second action.  If you were doing pre-sets, I can believe you would fire
a 2 count shout with around 3 counts inbetween.  The 3 counts of reaction
would be a enough to stabilizea 9mm recoil.

Ahem.  Nope.  Against an immobile target you are indeed at +120.  In theory
you do get that against snipers.  It might be way too high I haven't looked
at that number in years.
It will probably get reduced to plus 90, but it will still be high.

I am just looking at the wounded/exhausted/situational mods....

A person who is 200% wounded has to be at least the same as a tied up
person.
200% wounded  = +80 to-hit.  Hmmm...

At short range a proficient(RANK 4) gunman with a average MCF(15) and an
okay to-hit bonus(+5) and say one oka secondary (RANK 3) should be able to
hit a helpless target in the head at short range most of the time.  In BT
they would be.... 75% base - 20 = 55% base chance with apistol.   Helpless
target is currently +120 - 60 for called shot head is 60%.
55 + 60 = 115% chance to-hit.    Hmmm.. that is too high.

In real life did you know that the military only expects two-thirds of a
firing squads bullets to hit their target?  Now I suspect that that is
partially psychological(people missing on purpose, etc.) but I don't know.
That is point blank range for a rifle!!!  I am guessing i will adjust the
helpless target mods to +80.  That will be the maximum you can mod a person
based on eliminating their natural movmement and neutralizing their
defense.*shrug*

I think that is the above +80 or +120 in action./  Using the +80 you would
have a 90% chance to hit the head which would match your experince
relatively.

However- I knowe range and accuracy are very linked... rifles are much more
accurate than pistols by their very design.  The ;longer barrel has an
effect of stabilizing the round.  Even in places where the range categories
overlap a rifle would be more accurate.

[much good discussion deleted]


I absolutley do not want to do it on a skill by skill basis.  I would mor
elikely make it an optional rule the character can use if they wish too.  I
have no problem with a rule like that but it has to be simple;; (RANK-2)/2
is a simple formula.  I want something like that.
No logarithmic expansions or anything like that....  Does someone have a
proposal?
Keep in mind though the fact that people are alot more efficient at high
levels already- the example of the fighter doing three swings and three
kills for the same endurnce cost as a lower level fight doing a single skill
and wound.

Umm..... oh yeah- someone could be stupid enough to do that huh?   Remember
the 1% rule is optional- you have to say you are using it or you default to
1 END per.  Therefore you would have to be a little dim to activate that
rule until you made it to 100 END.  I don't think it is a problem.

Keep reading!:-)  Summary three also includes some more tables.  I am not
sure how to put qualitative control(I don't hit the hostage with my 2000
round burst) and duration (I make my spell last twelve hours instead of two)

Agreed.  You roll first- then you declare what you will do with the level of
success.  In a later post Mark will mention the problem of using ACT points
generated by a critical when you have finished the action already.  This is
a good point.  I am thinking you would reel back the counts and have it hit
a count or two earlier.  *shrug*

See summary three for more and some I have not yet determined.  I am open to

Not hate it at  all.  there are definitely failure levels.  They are no
different than before but will fall under the new nomenclature:

Fail normally:     1 FL (Failure level:-))
Fail by 50:           2 FL
Fail by 60:           3 FL
Fail by 70:           4 FL

FL= (amount failed by - 30)/10, round down.  0 or lower is declared as 1.

Umm.... no but all primary skills do get the same roll.  Some general skills

activation  but the rule is not.

I don't think of it as a sub-type.  Just there are certain skills that have

Absolutely!  Quickstrike delivers its entire RANK as SPD points!   Are they

I guess that could be workable in some situations, but non-causal stuff

Yes- I have been stepping away from meditation as a ""resting/recovery

restful to sleep than to meditate.

Absolutley!   In the sense that normally it takes 1 MEN to create 1 SPELL.

You can use the SUccess Levels- just not for TO-HIT mods.  It just says no
crit effects for to-hit mods.  You can reduce endurance, duration, generate

Yes- most of us- except Kay and maybe Pelleus don't fight in heavy campaign

See previous responses- it is unnecessary complication.  The new success
level options, the fact that character's can do more, take more actions for
the same endurance cost at higher levels all models this phenomena.

Although it might occasionally happen that you could use ACT points to push
yourself down a level of crit it would be rare.  One SL is only 3 ACT- that
is 6% to the total to-hit.

I think this is a good question and I think the answer is that we have to be
flexible.  It might be that you have to readjust which count the action
happens if someone  rolls well and wants to put it into act.  I don't mind
that.  It won't happen that often and it is workable.  But even now I
sometimes have to roll  before an attack finishes when people make
perception rolls I need to know whether it is hitting or not and where.....
so maybe we should start rolling right after the action is committed too...
I am not sure...

I think at the DESIGN level minuses for depth of action would apply.  In the

That was my first thought but it is just as bad-- situations change too
fast in combat.  At the Design level you could use it to reduce the
recovery phase, but I can't think of an easy way to integrate it with
the regular rules. (Or the normal flow of the space-time continuum)

Well.  The other option is that the ACT points would go towards the next
action.
I guess that would be the only other way to play it.  But I just keep having
the thought that it wouldn't be so bad to go back in time a few counts but I
guess it would cause difficulties.

SIGH.  What do other people think?  Any brilliant ideas?

"Re: Replies to people from Alex #1, 01/13/98",">>  Should we roll to hit on action start instead of action end? 

Yes, yes, yes.

1. No more 'backing up in Time' for those perceptions rolls and ACT
results.
2. More time to figure out damage, etc, during rest of battle.
3. Chance to play with SL results, especially useful for novice V6-ers.
4. More to do while waiting for your actions to complete.

How's that for starters?

I kind of liked the non-causal aspect of doing it the other way, but maybe
I'm
just strange that way.

It  -will-  make actions higher-committment, and will probably change the 
feel of combat.. I don't think that's a bad thing, but something you should
be
aware of.

You might want to try it out in play both ways before making a decision.

How about this? I start a 10 count sword swing, roll my success at the
beginning. What defense do I roll against? Has my opponent activated it?
Will he activate it before I finish my strike? Will he dodge? Will his
friend the mage cast a shield in front of him?

"RE: To hit roll at start of..","There are times that as soon as I start an action I know I'm not 
going to succede, diving after a ball in volleyball is a common 
example.  This may argue for the earlier roll.  Except there are a 
lot of times when I'm sure I'm going to kill to ball I end up muffing 
terribly.  This seems to be a stronger arguement against.

Actually there is no doubt in my mind, the answer to that question 
has to be no, no, no.  just for suspense reasons alone, not to 
mention all of Marc's very good rational reasons the roll has to come 
at the end of the action.  As for the original ACT question I'm 
reviewing your conversation but my solution would probably involve 
some exponential regression or logerithmic notation *smile*.

P.S. I know you are sick of this topic, but until someone explains to 
me why a warrior can keep running for longer than a track and field 
person, I think the problem still deserves attention.

How about this for a general benifit for movement (and possibly other 
skills)

RNK 1 =  5% reduction
RNK 2 = 10% reduction
RNK 3 = 15% reduction

RNK 10 = 50% reduction

I know you like to say the first two ranks in general are ineffective,
 but that seems to me to be where most of the improvement occurs.

"RE: a question on the ACT issue","I've read through the whole conversation again and have no good 
solution.  

The problem that Marc brings up when you suggested moving the roll 
works backwards too.
What if you succeded because the shield spell the mage had cast just 
wore off?  If you use ACT to move the action back in time the roll 
would have failed.

Here is my question?  Just how bad could this be?  What is the worst 
case? (lets limit rolls to 01-02's)
If the action is a very long one, WSP 20 counts (like a great blow 
with a two handed sword) the GM might have to replay as many as 15-18 
counts of time.  Could it get worse?  What about actions that are 
measured in days like Rituals or constructing a magic item, if the SL 
is high, do they reduce the time in ACT points? that doesn't seem 
right.

"Re: Replies to people from Alex #1, 01/13/98","My random thoughts on several topics

GUNS
   With a high modifier for stationary targets BT matches my (limited)
experience much better.  This on top of your high mods for movement just magnify
the difference motion makes all the more.  (Not necessarily a problem).  Sucks
to be a sniper though--I guess that's why they always hide so far away.
   I think the movement mods are actually pretty reasonable.  (I am assuming
that target movement speed is _relative_ to the shooter.)  One MPH equals
roughly .3 ft/count.  Roughly a -10% for every 3 MPH, so a car going 60 MPH
would be -200%, -40% for any motion = -240%.  A successful MCP perception would
cut it to -120%.  With set-up, design level mods for angle of approach and other
positive modifiers, these numbers seem pretty reasonable.  Presumably a critical
MCF perception would further decrease the movement mods?

KATA
   Why roll to activate a kata?  As long as you don't let them be abused (can
Stephen have a called-shot head, called-shot head, called-shot head kata? ;-)
they seem to be fairly limited in their application.  How many players have ever
bothered with them?  I'd just make them a normal support skill.  Also, I
understood the mechanism for switching between katas to be different.  The way I
designed my system (which I thought came out of a discussion Alex and I had) is
that if you have two kata, A-B-C-D and X-Y-B-Z, you could switch at B if you
declared it before commiting action B (sort of like declaring a pre-set).  Not
quite as powerful and I think fairly realistic.

FEINTS
   I agree with Mark that feint mods are too harsh in each direction.  At best a
feint should cancel an opponents defense, parry, etc., not give you +40 to hit. 
You are canceling his ability to avoid your blow, not convincing him to spit
himself on the end of your sword.  I like the idea of a changing level of effect
based on success (but you knew I would).

ON ACT AND CRIT LEVELS
   I also do not like the idea of rolling before an action, primarily for
suspense reasons.  There are also lots more playability reasons.  When do you
declare a preset?  What if you are wounded before your action finishes?
   Thinking out loud here...You can currently take a minus to hit to increase
speed at -10% = 1 SPD (or ACT, or whatever they are today ;-)  Trading critical

I like this, too.

The only argument for activation I can think of off the top of my head (I'm
trying to beat Alex's next summary here) is that all the 'mode' skills
(Wizardries, trances, etc) require activation.

Is Kata a 'mode' skill?  Does it include special perceptions (presumably
PCF)?  If it is not, should it be?  If not, perhaps the no-activation route
is the way to go.

Hm.  I think I like the non-switching version better, but I am not
well-schooled in
martial arts, the chief way of learning katas in the real world.  (Unless
you want to 
count those little typing-katas...)

Count me as interested observer, here.

Not sure I agree with Jeff's 'at best' here.  A feint causes an opponent to
react to 
a non-existant attack, making him more vulnerable to the real one.  If the
feint is
well-done (very convincing) and the opponent completely clueless (thinks
drastic
action is needed to preserve his life), he may indeed throw himself onto
your
blade.

Such events should be rare, though.

I guess I'm the only one who liked that idea, and (unfortunately) the
objections
are quite valid.   I withdraw my support of the concept.  (Can we go back
to
non-causal now?  Can we? Huh?)

Hm.  I like the start of this idea, but then it lost me.

With a called shot, you are taking minuses to your success chance to do an
action that is trickier than normal.

With a quickstrike, you are taking minuses to act faster than normal.

Is using (potential) SL's for ACT to act faster the same as a quickstrike? 
Should
it be? Quite possibly not, if only because the Quickstrike skill seems to
work as
it is.

My current thought is to declare the SL's for ACT ahead of time and
postpone the action if they are not obtained when the roll is made.  It
keeps Time flowing in only
one direction, and should be rarer than the 'back-up Time' option of
speeding up 
the action after it has been made.

Alternatively, if the roll is not made by the required margin (to pay back
the already-spent SL's), it could be declared a miss.  I like this option
less, as it seems
to intrude on Quickstrike territory.

Option 3 is to not allow SL's to be spent on ACT.  I don't like that at
all; it makes sense that a well-done action could be done more quickly.

*sigh*  I think this is a totally valid way to handle this.  I think it is
as good as any I have seen.  Here is what I would like to know: Do people
want this modeled this way?  Or do people feel that the  Speed/DAM/SL mods
from higher ranks sufficiently model higher end efficiency at high ranks?

BTW: Peter- I did somenumber crunching- a fighter with a bunch of rank 8s
and a runner with a bunch of rank 8s.  The runner runs the fighter into the
ground NO problem.  Mostly because the runner (both had same stats) is so
much FASTER than the fighter it made any contest a joke.  If you took time
out and the runner slowed down to the fighter's max speed, the runner could
cruise for many many times the fighter's duration.

I am willing to go with Peter's proposed system as a design level rule for
those who wish to use it- but it might be overkill..... If we did that as a
general rule I would want to restrict the size and the expansion speed of
the END pools.  This would BTW be more realistic and appeals to me.....
however it means to get the equivalent END and Men results people have now
they would have to calculate their END savings by rank.  *shrug* Much more
realistic- many people wouldn't want it....  OH god, I am getting
enrolled.... Somebody kill me...

Umm .. in my experience you need to ""load"" the Kata into your head.  Now
when you are good you can slip right into the Kata seamlessly, but having a
high rank would allow that and I do allow activation using ACT points.
*shrug* There is no reason except it seems to be a skill you need to bring
up.

;-)

I hate to say this but you could design a shooting Kata that looked like
that.  The only problem is that you have to define high,low, medium target;
which hex you are firing into, etc.  All the problems of a Kata.

>they seem to be fairly limited in their application.  How many players have

>bothered with them?

I have three player character with Kata right now: Menahan(Jim JM's Ronin),
Sterling Gwyn(Pam's sword mistress), and Pelleus Wyvernsbane(Bob's Baron).
They are limited in their application but under the right circumstances they
can be both effective and cool looking. :-)

Understood.  I was running it that way but the problem is that it doesn't
fit in with the pros/cons I am trying to modeling a Kata. You get all these
plusses, but the con is your opponent can predict your action if he knows
your Kata sequences.  Therefore it make more sense to keep sequences
inviolate.  *shrug*

I too like basing it on levels of success.  Did I miss a post?  Makr said
the pluses/minuses were too high?  I didn't think it was so bad.  They were
+/- 20 would that be better??

Remember that you take a -80 or so (in Rev 6 and lower it was -120!) to hit
someone just from their natural movement.   SO part of what a feint does is
""control"" their natural movement.  That is where the +40 came from.  I don't
think it is so much.

Mark responded:

>I kind of like this . . . . . no, I really like it.  I think it could work.

Okay.  Here is how I see it:
You can declare that you will use X SLs to speed up the action.  Then you
get the ACT points which correspond to that.  In the original chart it was
3, geoff mentioned 5 or 4.
Let us say 5.  If you then just generate less than X+1 success level you
miss.  If you generate more than X+1 success levels you can use them as you
normally would.
This system would co-exist with the option of buting ACT with 10% of your
to-hit.  Two system doing the same thing.  I personally don't have a problem
with this.

Well- in real life if you are good you can do anything. :-)  It is hard to
separate because Kata are also training tools in smoothly transitioning
between moves and stances so there is no hard evidence and truth to the
model.  *shrug* I just think the non-switching version is more balanced and
maintains the ""feel"" of Kata.

No minuses for the skill - skill just gives you SPD.  You can take -10%
to-hit to buy ACT points and act faster once you have reacted.

Similar except SL will give you ACT and Quickstrike skill lives you SPD.

I can get that!  But I think right now the system models general fitness

I'll buy that, although I liked having KI trance as a ""Healing"" trance.  
If I sleep for 8 hours and then use up half of my exhaustion in an
hour-long fire-fight can I go to sleep for 8 hours afterwards?  
Would you consider setting KI meditation recovery of exhaustion to be 6
points per hour?  Better than medium but not as good as deep.

What about endurance and meta-exhaustion recovery rates with regards to KI
meditation?

I would not.    And I would not let people sleep unless they were really
exhausted.

ENDURANCE is so fast at recovering that I think it isn't worth modeling in
trance AND meta-exhaustion will also be like medium sleep - .25 per hour.

Support skills with activation rolls can  use their crit effects for
non-to-hit related bonuses.

Hmmmmm..... I think that can be covered by the fact that you can switch into
another Kata inbetween sequences.  It is only if you try to interuppt a
specific 2-5 action sequence- like if you were doing the middle four moves
of Heian Shodan where you do a slow upper block, and then a quick upper
punch,  a quick upper counter-punch, and then a Great Blow upper punch.  You
wouldn't want to interuppt that sequence until you got to the last punch
then you could jump into Heian Yodan's sweeping side blocks instead of the
mid-level shutos of the next Heian Shodan sequence- but that is because you
were inbetween sequences.

My apologies if the Shotokan references confused people.

I agree.  But not all fighter's practice multi-action combinations.
(Remember shield-weapon interactions are florentines and handled that way)
Some do and some don't.  I suspect many fighter sdrill in things like Kata
that just get them better at PCF SPD and their general ability to use the

[Myth]

I don't like it.  I think the extra effect you get for the same endurance
(reflecting the greater skill chance and the extra ranks for base effect
and speed points) is enough to account for it.  As it stands, 2 SL's from
the roll will cut END costs in half-- a remarkable savings in itself.  I 
would
expect high-level people worried about endurance to use this option 
routinely.

Peter said:

No- the opposite.  Since you can buy ACT at 10% per ACT high level
characters would do that instead- because remember SL 1 is half the
high-level character's to-hit chance which is a lot of 10%s!!!!!    Only
someone who had less than a 60% chance would trade off  SLs- and then they
would run into the fact that their chance to succeed was so low as to make
it useless.  It was a good idea but falls apart in implementation.

>Could someone put together one of those very helpful (for me at

Given the above I don't think we need to.  Right?  Unless I am missing
something this concept isn't going to make it right?

I am a;little confused here Peter- are we talking about ENDURANCE or ACT?
With ACT gambling I think we should forget the idea.    With ENDURANCE I
think it would be a decent system- you know the 5% reduction per rank thing-
but it would mean I would have to balance the END and MEN equations to be a
lot lower (and mind you - as a plus- much more realistic.   Now for many
characters this would not be a big deal.... endurance isn't;t calculated so
often that it would slow the game down EXCEPT for mages.  Mages would have
to calculate their endurance rates for each spell and each time they cast
since amount of spell power- read mental endurance- is not fixed and varies
from application to application.    I am tempted to do something like this
rule but I am concerned about making mages and cyber-warriors spend more
time calculating things.... but then again- they are the ones least likely
to mind sitting on the side calculating while other people do stuff!  :-)

I don't know.  What do people think?

Her is how ENDURANCE  would work:

Warimu the Warrior says ""I cast a Firelance spell"".  Warimu has RANK 5 in
Firelance.  Therefore she is at 75% END cost.  The GM says okay- how many
spell points?  Warimu says: ""I want to do 30 points of DAM, and the base
cost is 10, and it is 1 DAM per 2 spell points so I will put 70 spell points
into it.""  Then, since in the character's environment 1 spell point costs 1
mental endurance(MEN) we need to calculate the cost.  70*.75=52.5=53.  So it
would cost Warimu 53 MEN to cast a 30-point firelance.

Roger the Runner says I am going to run for an hour.  Roger is RANK 7 in
running.  This means he is at 65% END cost for running.  His MVM is 10
(significantly faster than someone with no mvm skill BTW).  His  run speed
is therefore 6 feet/count, or 30 ft/second, or 1800 ft/minute.   (NOTE: This
is really really fast!) The cost for a run is: 1 END/30 counts, or 1
PEX/minute.   Roger has 120 END say.   The run will cost him .65
PEX(Physical Exhaustion) per minute.  So instead of being able to run two
hours Roger will be able to run about 184 minutes or a little over three
hours.

Calculations aren't too bad - I think it might actually work.  Though note-
PEOPLE's END and MEN will go down significantly!  I would leave the base as
it is but all the LVF additions and skill additions will be cut in half.
Thoughts?

I understand- I am going to lower some of them- like the -120 for totally
immobile character is almost certainly becoming -80.  I think the
environmental modifiers though  apart of your character.  You have control
of whether they effect you or not.  I like the idea of characters being able
to mod stuff to death (so long as it doesn't take too much time form play).
I do understand not wanting your characters main chances overwhelmed by mods
and I understand I need to scale to the system norms not the extremes.
(Though I have to stay awake to the Harpers and Mordaniths and Kays..)

CONTEST OF SKILLS

I think from now on all contests of skills between character swill be done
with Success Levels instead of ""How much you made it"".
PROS:
-It levels the playing field a little.
-You can use the SL difference to determine things like how much information
the guard got about the person sneaking up on them, etc.  how well did she
win the arm wrestling, how critical was the parry....
-it is much faster- all you need to know is what success level you ar in not
the exact percentage .  Less addition /subtraction etc.
CONS:
-Slight loss of granularity in the percentages

I think that's it!  Thoughts?

Move Silently success chance of 100%.  Gary has an Awareness of 120% so his
Awareness success chance to hear Jane sneaking up on him is 120%.
Jane rolls a 43 on her Move Silently.  This is Success Level 2(under half).
Gary rolls a 68 on his awareness.   This is Success Level 1.   Therefore
Gary has 1 Failure level in his perception and does not hear Jane.

Example 2: Alden the Active is swinging his Bastard Sword at Chuck the
Cheeky.
Chuck(assuming appropriate initiative and perception) decides to parry with
his open hand.  Alden's swing chance is 210%.  Chuck's parry chance(with
parry and non-weapon mods) is 160%.  Alden rolls a 98, giving him SL 2.
Chuck rolls a 12, giving him SL 4.  Alden's adjusted SL is now negative two:
(2-4=-2).  Thus he has two levels of failure on his sword swing, and
probably has to roll to hold on to his sword.

Example 3: Alden the Active gets really mad and decides to Great Blow Chuck
the Cheeky's head off.  He swings.  Chuck opts to do an active defense.  He
rolls his active defense.  Alden gets an amazing 4 SLs on his swing.  Chuck
gets 3 SLs on his Defense skill.  Thus Alden's adjusted SL for his Great
Blow is 1.  So Chuck gets hit by a SL 1 sword blow from Alden.

I'm not sure about this one . . . . I'll have to think about it. I think
it reduces overall effectiveness of Active defense. Lets see . . . Say
Chuck's current defense is about 90. AD gives a -180 to my opponent. 

New-
Say my AD roll is 150%. Average roll, 50. SL 2. Say my opponent is me.
;-).  210% to hit. Avg roll 50. SL 4?   Hit by SL2.

Old-
Opponent 210-180 = 30%. Avg roll- 50. No hit.
 ""                  - 90 = 120  Avg roll- 50. SL 2.

I'm actually better off NOT doing the active defense. (or does my base
defense stay under the new system?)

BTW, Chuck Cheeky PABs the damage. ;-)

Oh dear- i see the problem with the example!  Your opponent STILL has to
subtract your DEF from their to-hit chance!!!!!  They just won't subtract
double it whe you go active!

So the better  example would be:

Example 4: Alden the Active gets even madder and decides to take Chuck the
Cheeky's head off.  He swings.  His chance is 210% but Chuck's defense is
90.  Alden SC drops to 120%.  He rolls a 42.  This is success level 2.
Chuck opts to do an active defense.  He has 160% chance.  He rolls a 39 on
his active defense.   Chuck gets 3 SLs on his Defense skill.  Thus Alden's
adjusted SL for his attack is negative one, or FL(Failure Level) 1.  So
Alden misses despite his good roll!

Is an SL 0 a miss? SL 0 == FL 0?  No effect?

<answer A>Hmmm.. in the current conception:
There is no SL 0.   Or rather SL 0= FL 1.  Failure level 1 = you missed.
Failure level 2= you missed by 50.  , Failure level 3= you missed by 60.
Number missed by/10 -3!  Never smaller than 1!:-)

<answer B>OR SHOULD I call it all Success levels and just have success level

I still think a +40 is a lot.  Don't forget that on top of the ""-80"" for
swinging at a  target that is not immobile, people also get defense.  Defense as
I understand the concept is the person's ability to see a blow coming and move
so as to avoid being hit (or at least minimize the impact).  Feints, to me, are
an attempt to counter defensive actions like defense and feint.  I would get rid
of the +/-40 altogether and let feint subtract one level of success from parry,
for example.  I'm not sure how to handle defense though.  In my system evasion
is rolled vs. each attack as a contest of skills.  I don't know if you want to
get into this in BT, but if so the mechanism is then pretty straightforward. 
Otherwise maybe you could get a -10% per level of success in feint to the
target's defense.  That would keep the mods reasonable at low levels of success,
but give you the potential to convince people to jump onto the end of your sword
if you are extremely successful.  I still wouldn't let it do more than cancel
defense though.

I was actually suggesting that you use either the current -10% = 1 SPD OR switch
to 1 SL = 5 ACT.  I agree that they are redundant.  I'm not sure which is
easiest or best to use, but I would pick one and discard the other altogether.

Cool.  If Stephen wants to quickstrike a kick he just has to shoot somebody

I am in favor of making everything based on levels of success and contests of
skill, as you might have guessed.  Am I correct in assuming in the example above
that even if Gary had rolled lower and got 2 levels of success he would not hear
Jane since his success level would be zero?

GUNS
I have given the gun mods more thought and I still don't like them.  If you get
plusses to your base chance to hit a still target and minuses to hit a moving
target, what does your chance represent???  I think you should make the gun
chance the chance to hit a stationary, human sized target at short range, then
design your mods around that:

1)  Make the movement mods even harsher if you need to (they may still be harsh
enough).

2)  The range mods already make sense.

3)  Drop the negative modifiers for short barrel length.  (Consider this partial
payback for dropping the +80 to hit a stationary target).  Apply longer barrel
length to counteracting negative range mods, or if you really believe they apply
even at point blank range, make short barrel +0 and give positive modifiers for
longer barrels.

With a slightly positive base chance from barrel length, two handed firing,
stance, and a second or two of set up, people would have about a 100% chance to
hit a human sized target at short range.","Geoffrey Hodge","ghodge@relay-1.ziplink.net","SMTP","Jim Smith","JS_Myth@compuserve.com","SMTP","INTERNET:ghodge@ziplink.net;Chris Carlucci;Mark DesMarais;Jack Garrity;Peter Hannaford;Lisa Hodge;Alexander M.

I like it too. Especially since there was no SL 0 before. A single
continuous measure is better than having to switch units part way
through! Although the steps are different . . . . .

SL -2     miss by 60
SL -1      ""         50
SL  0     just miss
SL 1      just hit
SL 2      hit by 1/2
SL 3      hit by 25%
SL 4      hit by 25%+10

Would it be worth it to make it symmetric? Mega Crit fails would be less
common, and the calculation is a little more difficult. . . .

SL -3     miss by 1/4 chance +10
SL -2     miss by 1/4 chance
SL -1     miss by 1/2 chance
SL  0     just miss

There is a small error in the chart starting at SL -2:

SL -3     miss by 3/4 again their chance +10
SL -2     miss by 3/4 again their chance
SL -1     miss by 1/2 again their chance
SL  0     just miss
SL 1      just hit
SL 2      hit by 1/2 chance
SL 3      hit by 1/4 chance
SL 4      hit by 1/4 chance -10

There is only one problem with this:  The 50 point buffer for crit misses
protects people from crit missing all the time when they have a low(like
25%) chance to do something.  I don't think I want to remove that buffer.
Because with a 25% chance to hit the person will crit miss by rolling a
38!!!!  Too easy.

Perhaps we could use the above chart with the proviso that SL -1 can only
come after 50 points, or something like that.

Ahh yes- but see above.  I think Myth is right on the mark when he says ""A
feint causes an opponent to react to a non-existant attack, making him more
vulnerable to the real one"". The key for me is MORE vulnerable.  I think a
feint can do more than just cancel out the defense- I think it can have the
person move or act such that they are in a more disadvantaged position than
just not using their defense.  They step into a better range, open a more
vulnerable target, etc.  It is better to succeed in a feint than to have
your opponent say I don't really apply my defense to that attack.  For many
characters their defense is between 10 and 30. This is actually the most
common spread.  Some people are way higher.  But a +10 or +30 for a feint is
really negligible.    At higher levels- people who have 100 Defenses are
juicier tagrets for feints but they give their opponent +100% if the feint
works in the proposed system.

The way it is written now you only lose half you defense- so the 100 DEF
person is not the same as the 20 DEf person- which I like!  And it gives +40
to the feinter.  So ...
Then 20 DEF person's DEF goes to -20, and thus gives +20 to-hit for the
feinter, and the 100 DEF person's DEF goes to 10(DEF/2-40), and thus gives
a -10 for the attacker.  Those aren't bad number s at all.

True but I am not sure I want two rolls for each interaction(an attack roll
and defense roll).

See above. Tell me what you think.

  :-) :-):-)
But seriously....that is the truth.  No to-hit chances in Bardic Tales are
based on an immobile person.  Everything is based on a person aware of the
attack that is engaged in normal defensive movement.  This is because that
is the situational modifier in place 90% of the time in the game.  It is the
default mode.  Now... it is a lot easier to-hit a stationary target.  That
is why extreme movement is modded and extreme low movement is modded.

I hear you.  I don't want to because of the above.

Again- look above.  When I number crunched Joe Average(THB:+0, MCF: 10, RANK
4 in pistol, -25 for a short pistol, no secondaries or supports).

I came to 25% chance to-hit the torso-size(no minuses) target of an aware,
mobile person at short range with one hand(no grip mods), with no
set-up(lift gun and shoot), and no stance(just pops it off where he is
standing).

If he sets up for one second(5 counts-+25), uses a two-handed grip(+20), and
steps into a standing shooting stance(+15) he has an 85% chance per shot of
hitting an aware, mobile person in the torso.  This means if he unloads a
clip of  five bullets, say that 1 will miss and  4 will hit the target.  2
of them will be grazing shots, 1 will be full damage, and 1 will hit a
critical location.

The person gets to use half their DEF against his chance.

These numbers are just fine for me... and that is with the shortest barrel
length gun.

Anyone else have an opinion?

As you can see from above they do that.  With a non-mobile target- like a
paper cut out- you add +80.  That means in the first example(popping the
shot off) he will have an 105% chance to-hit the target.  In the second
example he would have 165% chance to-hit the target.    Might even be a
little high!!!:-):-):-).

This is a fine and logically consistent concept, I'm just not sure how true it
is.  It does not match my limited experience with martial arts or fencing.  You
can certainly draw a defending person into a much worse position than they were
holding, but can you really make them worse than non-defending?  I still don't
buy it.  What are other peoples' real life experiences?

I disagree.  For evidence, reference your own argument to Mark about critical
failures for low level characters.

No, they do not get a +100%.  Their opponent loses a -100%--a small but
important technicality.  When you are dealing with such high level characters, I
do not have a problem with mods in this range.  A parry could potentially
subtract much more than 100%--you deal with modifying skills in this range all
the time in BT at high levels.

If a character has a 100 DEF, presumably they have a PCF perception to back it
up.  If you notice, my idea was not all or nothing.  You would need to rack up
many Feint SLs beyond their PCF perception SLs to get a cancel a -100 DEF.  If
you feint that brilliantly, or your opponent does not have a good PCF Perception
to match their DEF, I have no problem with their defence being neutralized.

You lost me.  What's this half defense?  Was that always the rule or did you
just make that up? ;-)  Why is it not applied to the 20 DEF?

I think this works fine with melee combat because you are rarely in melee combat
with somebody who is standing still (unless you feint a lot ;-)  It makes sense
to base melee combat on a moving target.

However, the normal use of missile weapons is not against a character in melee
combat against the missile wielder.  Defense is not (and should not be) usually
used in missile combat.  Targets are typically stationary, moving or dodging,
all of which you have mods for, and none of which involve the same default mode
you use for melee weapons.  I don't think you can use the same default mode for
both without some serious kludges to the system, which is what the +120 is (or
what the +80 will be).  In 10 years of playing Stephen you have never applied
this modifier--and it's not like he has never fired at a stationary target.  I
think you forgot it because it does not make sense.  Chopping it down to 80 will
only decrease the amount that it does not make sense.","Geoffrey Hodge","ghodge@relay-1.ziplink.net","SMTP","Alexander M.

"Re: Replies to people from Alex #1, 01/13/98 (on feints and guns)","Okay.  One of the problems we have in this discussion, as always, is
defining our terms.
Let me create some definitions and see if they work.  I will refer to these
in responding to Geoff's comments....

immobile: someone who is not moving at all, sleeping, a paper target, a
window
    MISSILE and MELEE MODS: +80 to-hit, no DEF

non-defending: a person that is making normal movements but is not held or
staying stock still.   Is not aware of an attack or making any attempt to be
hard to hit.
    MISSILE and MELEE MODS: no DEF, +40 to-hit

aware, mobile: a person aware of an incoming attack and attempting to make
themself hard to hit.  NOT running or actively dodging.
   MISSILE MODS: -DEF/2, no pluses to-hit
   MELEE MODS: -DEF, no pluses to-hit

NOTE: [THIS IS THE STANDARD MODE FOR ALL BT COMBAT INTERACTIONS- MODS
DEVIATE FROM THIS POINT BECAUSE IT IS THE MOST COMMON TYPE OF INTERACTION IN
THE GAME.]

defending: an opponent that is dodging, moving quickly, actively and
primarily avoiding being hit.
     MISSILE MODS: contest of skills for defense or dodge, -DEF/2, plus any
movement minuses, any minuses for cover, etc.
     MELEE MODS: contest of skills for defense or dodge, -DEF, minus any
combat movement mods, any minuses for position, etc.

My experience is that you can move someone into a worse position with
feinting.  I saw Reinhard Bartleman- the Nidan that taught us Shotokan
freshman year throw a fake Uraken at a guy that caused the guy to turn, open
up with a block, and walk right into a roundhouse kick.   I have seen that
done on multiple occasions- even done it once or twice.

I think it isn't as obvious in foil fencing because of the low commitment.
*shrug* though I have seen someeppeists send their blades flying way out of
line in repsonse to a threat!!

Part of the problem though I think Geoff is that I think- I could be wrong-
but what you consider the ""base"" state is what I call ""non-defending"" above.
I any model you have to pick an origin point - a zero point.  I picked what
I call aware and mobile because it is what i think the most common state for
role-player to be interacting inside of.   Therefore- in comparing our
positions- that +40 to-hit is a part of defense.  It isn't that if your
defense is deactivated youare still- ther eis another 40 points of buffer
there.  What I was modeliing with the +40 is that a successful feint WILL
strip your defense and make you ""non-defending"" for that one strike.

It may be that we even agree now- that it was just nomenclature.  But let me
know if this resolves the question....

I think that is a whole different discussion- the crit conversation with
Mark is that with a 25% chance to-hit a half again crit fail chance is only
a 12% margin to fail normally- and I say that is way to small- we need a
much bigger margin(50% say):-)
You can generate +10% practically anyway... in BT 10-30 % are not big
numbers....

Maybe I misunderstood your idea.  I thought it was that if the feint
succeeded (vs. the perception) they lost their DEF and that was it.  Did I
miss something?

It is applied to the DEF.  Re-read the new fewint rules- if the feint
succeeds the person being feinted against  loses HALF their DEF, and the
feinter gets +40 to hit.

Ummm... see the very top of this post.  I am willing to be enrolled
otherwise, but as far as I can see it makes sense to base all of BT combat
on one zero point and mod from their.  I disagree that most missile combats
happen in a different mode- I think most missile combats are against ""aware,
mobile"" opponents- just in missile combat they are more likely to start
using dodge, cover and movement rather than defense, combat movement, and
parries....  it also makes sense form a system point of view because you
know what the base-line is.

What do you think of all this, Geoff?  Others?  I would love to hear what
some of the rest of you have to say.  I spoke to Jim in person yesterday and
he hasn't read the post and will prob respond later to it but agreed on the
uniform baseline on active. mobile.  And I think Geoff- that we may even
agree on that and just disagree on where to zero the system.

          ON TYPES OF SKILLS

In Bardic Tales the interface between the player and the actions their
character takes is the ""skills"" of the character.  A skill is a piece of
knowledge or training or automatic behavior that a character has that allows
them to take an action.  Skills include things like knowing how to build a
car, flying a helicopter, swinging a sword in combat, identifying someone's
emotional state, noticing a hidden ambusher, or cooking a great ham.

Skills can be used in a variety of ways and come in several types.  The
types of skills are: primary, secondary, tertiary, general, and support.
There is an optional type called related skills discussed here as well.

All skills in Bardic Tales fit into one or more of these categories. How to
apply the skill depends on what category it is in. Bear in mind that these
types of skills only apply on a per application basis. Most skills can be
used in at least three ways: A skill that is used as the Primary skill for a
given roll may be used as a Secondary, Tertiary, or even General Skill for a
later roll, depending on the task at hand.

Some of these skills merely act as modifiers while others need to be rolled.
This skill breakdown is an attempt to codify and methodize something that in
real life is the result of at least hundreds of factors and conditions.
This is a vast simplification.  Please bear that in mind.

***
Primary Skills

Primary skills are the primary use of the skill. If you were shooting
someone with a Walther PPK, for example, your pistol skill would be the
primary skill.   If you do not have a skill in the correct area your RANK is
considered to be 0 (unless you have a related skill.  See the Option Rule
re: Related Skills)

Primary skills are calculated by adding RANK*10 to Level Factor(LVF).  This
gives the Base Success Chance(BSC). The BSC can be modified by situation and
environmental factors.  There can only be one primary skill for each action.

Primary skills add ([RANK] - 2) to both SPeeD(SPD) and EFFect(DAM).

Primary Skill Effect Summary:
BC=10%/RANK,  SPD=RANK -2,  DAM=RANK-2

***
Secondary Skills

Secondary skills are skills that are closely related to the primary, that
use similar tools, are appropriate lore skills, or operate in the same
general area.  They add to the person's chance, speed and effectiveness with
a particular skill.

Here is a list of some primaries and their possible secondaries:
  Pistol: rifle and Targeting Perception
  Fist: Foot and Elbow-Strike
  Power Blast: Psi Shield and SCF Set-up
  Sword: Knife and Mace
  Driving Car: Pilot Helicopter and Car Lore

Secondary skills are calculated as [RANK]*3 added to the primary skill they
are supporting.  You can only pick two secondary skills for each primary
skill roll.

Secondary skills add ([RANK] - 2)/2 to both the SPD and DAM of the primary
skill. The value for these is never negative.

Secondary Skill Effect Summary:
BC = 3%/RANK,  SPD = (RANK - 2)/2,  DAM = (RANK - 2)/2

***
Tertiary Skills

Tertiary skills are vaguely related skills that assist the character in
performing the primary skill.  Any skill that can be a secondary can also be
a tertiary, and even a vague connection to the primary skill is usually
sufficient to convince the GM to let you use a skill as a tertiary!:-)

Tertiary skills are calculated as [RANK]*1% added to the primary. You can
only pick two tertiary skills for each primary skill roll.

Tertiary skills do not add SPD and DAM bonuses.

Tertiary Skill Effect Summary:
BC = 1%/RANK

***
Support Skills

Support skills are skills which are particularly designed to support or
enhance another skill. They often model a variation or particular action
that is a use of a primary skill. Some examples are: Florentine, Parry,
Called Shot, Quickstrike, Great Blow, Lunge, etc.

Support Skills are typically linked to a family of skills not just one
particular skill. You wouldn't have ""Quickstrike: Long Sword"" you would have
""Quickstrike: Bladed Weapons"". Support skills are locked- not any skill can
be a support skill.  The prefix for a support skill is ""S:"".

There is no limit to the number of support skills one can use with a primary
so long as one is performing the action they apply to. If you have unused
support skills they may be used as secondaries(see description above).

NOTE: Some support skills must be rolled against as a primary to ""activate""
their effect.  There are two kinds of this roll- the activation roll and the
use roll.

The Activation roll:
This is a binary on/off roll- the roll must be successful to use the support
skill but there are no critical effects possible to-hit. Success levels can
be used, though, to generate any non to-hit related bonuses.  These
activation rolls typically take 4 counts.  Kata and Florentine are examples
of support skills that one must activate.

The Use roll:
In this case the support skill is rolled as a primary, with the main skill
as a secondary.  Typically this is as a contest of skills.  In that case the
roll is treated as a primary.  Feint is an example of a use roll skill.  If
a support skill requires a use roll it will be detailed in the skill
description- support skills default to the mode described elsewhere in this
section.

Support skills do not add SPD or DAM bonuses unless they are specifically
designed to do so. If not specified elsewhere they add 3% per [RANK].
However, each support skill can have its own special functions so refer to
<Appendix G: Combat Options and Support Skills> in the User's Guide.

  Note that some support skills do not contribute to-hit or def:
Quickstrike,   Quickdraw

  Some do not contribute to SPD: Called Shot, Set-Up, Evasion, Armor
Wearing, Great Blow

  Some do not contribute to DAM: Called Shot, Quick Strike, Quick Draw,
  Feint, Parry, Set-up. Evasion, Armor Wearing, Instant Attack, Great Blow

Support skills can go above the negative modifier for a skill. (i.e. a RANK
15 Florentine character gets +45% and the minus is only minus 40%.  This
person is 5% better florentining than not florentining.)

Support Skill Effect Summary:
BC = 3%/RANK (sometimes) - VARIES WITH SKILL DESCRIPTION. SEE RULES OR GM.

General Skills

General skills are umbrella skills that include a whole group of skills in
their domain. Martial styles and Schools of Wizardry are examples of general
skills. Only skills that are primaries should be put in a general skill. A
framework for a generic General skill could include:

  Appropriate Lore skill
  Appropriate Perception skill
  + 5 or so Primary skills that make the pattern.

Note that the content of a general skill is fairly flexible.  It is not
locked in stone.  Some general skills require an activation roll- that is
the character must use an action - or ACT points- to roll the General skill
as a primary to begin applying the mods to their skills.
General skills are locked- not any skill can be a general skill.  The prefix
for a general skill is either G: or W: .

General skills add 3% to-hit per rank, and (RANK - 2)/2 SPD/DAM. Most things
have at least one applicable General skill.   You can only have one general
skill per primary skill roll.

Parentheses indicate support skills that should be taken to complete the
General.

***
Related Skills (Optional Rule)

A BT Related Skill is a non-additive replacement skill for a primary skill.
It must be close enough to the primary skill that a percentage of it can be
applied to the success chance INSTEAD of the that primary skill. Example:

I have a RANK 5 in drive truck. I jump in the car. I have RANK 1 in Drive
car. They are RELATED at 4/5. This means when I calculate out my chance to
drive car, I can use 4/5 of my truck RANK to drive the car INSTEAD OF the
RANK 1 in Drive Car. It is useful because if you can drive a truck at rank 5
you can CERTAINLY drive a car at least 60-80% of your chance. However they
are not really additive- you shouldn't get 3/4 or 4/5 of your truck RANK to
add to your CAR rank because the principles are very similar.
However you can use your RANK one in DRIVE CAR as a secondary (3% per rank,
etc)

***
SKILL CHANCES

All this is designed to generate the percentage chance of the character
fulfilling on a particular task.  This final chance is called the Final
Success Chance(FSC).  The formula summarizing the effects of the various
skill types on the FSC is:

FSC = Primary Skill Rank *10
      + [Secondary Skill Rank] *3 + [Secondary Skill Rank] *3
      + [Tertiary Skill Rank] + [Tertiary Skill Rank]
      + [General Skill Rank] *3
      + [Any Support Skills' Ranks] *3
      + [Appropriate Level Factor]
      + MODS + DIFF_MOD

Not every slot will be filled for every action- a character may not have
applicable skills for any of the slots. Note that square brackets [ ] around
a value means that value is truncated(i.e. 4.6 becomes 4). More information
on SITUATIONAL MODS can be found in the success chance section of Chapter 2:
System Rules and in the Situational Modifiers table in Chapter 3: Combat

RAW SUCCESS CHANCE(RSC) = Primary*10 + LVF

BASE SUCCESS CHANCE(BSC) = Primary*10 + LVF + DIFF_MOD

FINAL SUCCESS CHANCE(FSC) = Primary*10 +2Secondaries*3 + 2Tertiaries*1 +
1General*3 + Supportskills*3 + LVF + DIFF_MOD + MODS

DIFF_MOD = Difficulty modifier for the action or tool being used.
MODS= Situational, or environmental modifiers to the action
NOTE: No skill can appear in the Final Success chance more than once.

--- --- ---
          ON CRITICALS/SUCCESS LEVELS

It is axiomatic to most RPGs and realism simulations that there is a chance
for particularly good successes.  Out of this, the concept of ""criticals"" or
""success levels"" comes.
In BT the distinctions are now made along these breakpoints:

SN = Success number = number you need to roll to succeed in the skill- this
is your FSC.

CSN = Critical Success Number = 1/4 of your SN.

CFN = Critical Failure Number = SN + 50

SL = Success Level

NOTE: In these discussions we will speak about damage and effect
interchangeably.  Mostly this is an artifact of the skill system growing out
of a gaming system that focused on modeling weapon effects.  However the
pluses to Damage(DAM), and the multipliers for effect are both modeling the
same area.  For purposes of weapons effect is damage and for purposes of
non-weapon skills DAM is the same as effect.

     Effect of Success Levels on Effect
At or under the success number:  SL 1  skill applied,half-effect
At or under half the SN:         SL 2        full-effect
At or under quarter the SN(CSN): SL 3        1.5* effect
At or under CSN-10:              SL 4        2* effect
At or under CSN-20:              SL 5        2.5* effect
At or under CSN-30:              SL 6        3* effect etc.

     Success Levels also measure levels of failure:
Over the success number:    SL +0  missed to-hit, action not successful
Over SN by 50(CFN):         SL -1  -20% to save or recovery roll
Over CFN+10:                SL -2  -40% to save or recovery roll
Over CFN+20:                SL -3  -60% to save or recovery roll
Over CFN+30:                SL -4  -80% to save or recovery roll

To get the damage modifier of a hit, divide the SL by 2.  That is the effect
multiplier.  This assumes you are using your SLs for effect.  Negative SLs
subtract 20% per negative SL from the appropriate save or recovery roll.

You could also use them for reducing END cost(see Endurance section for
success level effect on Endurance), or increasing effect duration(mechanism
to be determined), or effect control(mechanism to be determined), or some
other things I am sure you will all think of....

NOTE: It is advisable to always put at least one level of success into
effect/damage or you will have no effect!:-)(Although I can see in a
proactive fight you might put all your success levels into endurance cost or
showmanship or something...)

     Effect of Success Levels on Endurance
1 x2/3
2 x1/2
3 x2/5
4 x1/3
5 x2/7
6 x1/4
...
     Effect of Success Levels on INIT points
SL INIT
1  +2
2  +4
3  +6
4  +8
5  +10
6  +12

NOTE:  INIT points from SL(SL*1.5, round down) go towards the reaction
IMMEDIATELY after the action (i.e. the character is so much smoother with
the action they can transition into the next action better.
...
The SL is the amount {(CSN - number rolled)/10 + 3 [rounded down]} for all
successes below SL 2.

Example:

SN=100 so CSN=25.

I roll a 66.  This is a SL 1. One level of success.
*
I roll a 43.  That is a SL 2.  It is two levels of success to apply
to whatever I want.  One could apply both levels to effect(full damage), OR
one level to effect(1/2 damage) and one level to reducing endurance(2/3
endurance cost).
*
I roll a 22.  That is a SL 3.  It is three levels of success to play
with.
I could put one to Endurance(2/3 cost) and two to effect(full damage)
or all three to effect(1.5*damage)
or one to INIT points(2 points), one to Endurance(2/3 cost), and one to
Effect(.5*damage).
*
I roll a 13.  That is a SL 4.  It is four levels of success to play with.
I could put three to effect(1.5*damage) and one to endurance(2/3 cost),
or one to effect(1.5*damage) and three to endurance(2/5 cost), etc.

End Example.

--- --- ---
          ON CONTEST OF SKILLS

I think from now on all contests of skills between characters will be done
with Success Levels instead of ""How much you made it"".

Example 1:  Jane the Jackknife is sneaking up on Gary the Guard.  Jane has a
Move Silently success chance of 100%.  Gary has an Awareness of 120% so his
Awareness success chance to hear Jane sneaking up on him is 120%.
Jane rolls a 43 on her Move Silently.  This is Success Level 2(under half).
Gary rolls a 48 on his awareness.   This is Success Level 2 as well.
Therefore Gary has SL 0 in his perception and does not hear Jane.

Example 2: Alden the Active is swinging his Bastard Sword at Chuck the
Cheeky.  Chuck(assuming appropriate initiative and perception) decides to
parry with his open hand.  Alden's swing chance is 210%.  Chuck's parry
chance(with parry and non-weapon mods) is 160%.  Alden rolls a 98, giving
him SL 2.  Chuck rolls a 12, giving him SL 4.  Alden's adjusted SL is now
negative two: (2-4=-2).  Thus he has two levels of failure on his sword
swing, and probably has to roll to hold on to his sword.

Example 3: Alden the Active gets really mad and decides to Great Blow Chuck
the Cheeky.  He swings.  Chuck opts to do an active defense.  He rolls his
active defense.  Alden gets an amazing 4 SLs on his swing.  Chuck gets 3 SLs
on his DEfense skill.  Thus Alden's adjusted SL for his Great Blow is 1.  So
Chuck gets hit by a SL 1 sword blow from Alden.

Example 4: Alden the Active gets even madder and decides to take Chuck the
Cheeky's head off.  He swings.  His chance is 210% but Chuck's defense is
90.  Alden FSC drops to 120%.  He rolls a 42.  This is success level 2.
Chuck opts to do an active defense.  He has 160% chance.  He rolls a 39 on
his active defense.   Chuck gets 3 SLs on his Defense skill.  Thus Alden's
adjusted SL for his attack is negative one, or SL-1.  So Alden misses
despite his good roll!

PROS:
-It levels the playing field a little.  Lucky low-level people have more
chance of success against high-level people.
-You can use the SL difference to determine things like how much information
the guard got about the person sneaking up on them, etc. how well did she
win the arm wrestling, how critical was the parry....
-it is much faster- all you need to know is what success level you are in
not the exact percentage.  Less addition /subtraction etc.

CONS:
-Slight loss of granularity in the percentages
-It levels the playing field.:-)

          ON ENDURANCE

In this conversation Physical and Mental Endurances are equivalent.
Therefore we refer to END and EXT- but these refer to both Physical
Endurance(END) and Mental Endurance(MEN).  Likewise for exhaustion.
Physical and Mental endurance and exhaustion are recovered simultaneously
and identically.

Currently END, EXT, and M-EXT (Endurance, Exhaustion, and Meta-Exhaustion)
use the idea that Endurance is like a pool of energy that you have a certain
amount of and that increases as one becomes more skilled.  Actions use up
Endurance like fuel.

***
ENDURANCE:  Basic ""fuel unit"".
It returns after use at 1 per ten counts... usually all back in 3-5 minutes.
Resting or sleeping doubles the return rate.

***
EXHAUSTION: EXT comes off the top of END at a rate of 1 per 10 END expended.
It returns at 1 per two hours of rest, 2 per hour of light sleep, 4 per hour
of medium sleep, and 8 per hour of full deep sleep.  Meals can also restore
1-3 EXT three times a day.  Meditation is as medium sleep.

***
META-EXHAUSTION: M-EXT comes off END as well.  One accumulates one M-EXT for
every 10 EXT one accumulates.
It returns at a rate of: 1 per 4 hours of complete rest(not doing any
activity- not expending more than 20 endurance in an hour), 1 per 2 hours of
deep sleep(Deep sleep is usually achieved in the third hour of sleep)

***
Your first hour of sleep is light sleep and gives you 2 EXT, .25 M-EXT
Your second hour of sleep is medium sleep and gives you 4 EXT,.25 M-EXT
All following hours of sleep are deep sleep and give you 8 EXT,.5 M-EXT

If a character is moving or acting at some percentage of full effort
(travelling with slower companions, taking their time, only punching white
belts) they only expend that percentage of the END cost of the action.  i.e.
if a character has a walk of 1.4 and the group is moving at .7, she only
expends 50% of the END cost for that type of movement.

Levels of critical can be used to decrease endurance cost just like they can
be used to increase damage.  The following table describes the effect:

     Effect of Success Levels on Endurance
1 x2/3
2 x1/2
3 x2/5
4 x1/3
5 x2/7
6 x1/4
...
NOTE: In most cases you need to put at least one success level in a roll to
effect or there will be 0 effect.  :-)  So usually you would never put all
your success levels towards reducing endurance.

***
OPTIONAL RULE:

Whenever the rules call for recovering 1 ENDURANCE, EXHAUSTION, or
META-EXHAUSTION it is read as 1% of the character's endurance.  The amount
of endurance recovered is tallied and then the modifier is applied.
I.e. if a character recovers 54 points over night, and the character evokes
this optional rule, then that is translated to 54% of total and rounded up
to the nearest integer.  This rule will probably only be used by characters
with ENDURANCES over 100... :-)

***
OPTIONAL RULE(DESIGN LEVEL):

PROBABLE: REQUIRES SECONDARY STAT RECONFIGURATION- END AND MEN BASE WOULD
REMAIN THE SAME BUT EXPANSION EFFECTS(LVFs, SKILL EFFECTS) WOULD BE CUT IN
AT LEAST HALF

Endurance costs for skills would be:  COST - RANK*(.05*COST) with the COST
never dropping to zero.
>RNK 1 =  5% reduction
>RNK 2 = 10% reduction
>RNK 3 = 15% reduction
>  (etc.) -           -
RNK 10 = 50% reduction
>  (etc.)
>RNK 20 = 100% reduction (wow)-> becomes 1 END or EXT or M-EXT.

          ON TIME

Managing flow of actions, sequencing of occurrences, and time-flow in Bardic
Tales is modeled by breaking time up into discrete units called counts.
Each count is the equivalent of a fifth of a second.

There is a system called ""initiative"" that manages when a character acts and
reacts in counts.  This is based on a series of variables including the
primary stats AGL, DSC, and INT; the secondary stats of Physical Speed(PSPD)
or Mental Speed(MSPD); the Total Level Factor of the character(TLF); the
Physical Level Factor(PLF) or Mental Level Factor(MLF), and the Level Factor
of the skill being used in the action.  This ""initiative"" also includes the
person's RANK in the skill about to be used, and in the similar skills
supporting it, the character's physical well-being, mental state, and other
situational modifiers.  These variables are all bundled together under a
single number called SPD.

To simulate the variability of our interface with the world, the
""initiative"" is generated by rolling two 6-sided dice and adding them
together and then modifying them by SPD/2(rounded up).  The resultant number
is the number of counts a character must wait until they can start an
action.  This is their ""reaction time"" in counts.

During the course of a combat or specific interaction, the GM will walk
through time count by count. In each count there is an action phase and then
a reaction phase.   When a person ""rolls initiative"" and generates a number,
that number is the number of counts the person takes to ""react"" to their
environment and start an action.  If the number is negative(due to
modifiers) then it is declared as zero counts and the person can declare
what action they are starting in the reaction phase of that count, and it
will start in the action phase of the next count.

All negative initiative(plus SPD/2[rounded down]) gets turned into ACTION
POINTS(ACT), which can be used to speed up the time it actually takes to do
the action.

Each action has a speed assigned to it.  This is called WeaponSpeed(WSD-
this is another layover from the time when all skills were modeling
combat!).  This speed is also a measure of the ""counts"" it takes to perform
the action.   So once the person is finished reacting(in the reaction phase
of the count their reaction completes) they would confirm which action they
were starting in the action phase of the next count.  That would be the
first count of the action.  When they reach the action phase of the count
which is (modified WSD) counts later they would roll their skill roll and
the action would take place.

Some skill options that change this slightly are pre-sets and instant
attacks.  The only difference is that when using a pre-set you roll 2d6/2
instead of 2d6 for the reaction variation.  In an instant attack you proceed
as if you had ROLLED a 0[normally impossible] on your 2d6/2 pre-set roll.

SPEED mechanics are explained in more detail below.

--- --- ---
          ON SPEED

Speed Points(SPD) => the number generated by the character's PSPD/MSPD stat,
plus the LVF/10, plus the RANK modifiers: primary(RANK-2),
secondaries([RANK-2]/2), and general([RANK-2]/2), plus any SPECIAL
POINTS(Support skills like Quickstrike, Environmental variables, Physical
and Mental state of the character)

Initiative points(INIT) => the number subtracted from the characters
initiative roll.  It is equal to half the speed points, rounded up. Is added
to directly by some SUPPORT SKILLS like Kata.

Action Points(ACT) => the points used to speed up actions, perform passive
actions or add to-hit.  It is equal to half the speed points, rounded down.
Is added to directly by some SUPPORT SKILLS like Quickdraw

Negative initiative turns into ACT on a 1 per 1 basis.

Quickstrike generates 1 SPD per RANK.    Kata generates 1 INIT per RANK.  A
specific Quickdraw skill generates 1 ACT per RANK.

To buy 1 ACT => 10% to-hit or 3 points of damage(only for muscle-powered,
non-stored-energy weapons) or 1 negative initiative

One ACT will buy you:  2%-to-hit or 1/3 DAM or 1 count off of a passive
action.

Examples of passive actions: perception[8 counts], support skill
initiation[usually 8 counts], general skill activation[usually 8 counts,
Kata [not a general skill but a support skill that required activation- is 4
counts], etc.  So 8 ACTION points will buy you a full passive perception or
general skill activation.

--- --- ---
          ON SETUP

Set-up in real counts will give you 5% per count and is limited to:

(1) 10 + KIF/2 counts of set-up AND

(2) a maximum value equal to  (RANK*10+LVF)- or the default value(saves,
MAP, etc.)- of the skill being set-up for.

Do not include secondaries or generals in set-up base chance and do not
include the difficulty of the skill.  Only include the RAW SUCCESS CHANCE:
RANK*10 + LVF.  This is because the more difficult actions are where set-up
is really needed and IMO makes the most difference in real-life.

The set-up skill allows you to double the set-up bonus per count for the
first RANK counts of set-up.

ON INSTANT ATTACK

Instant attacks are attacks in which the initiative roll is
automatically adjusted to 0.  It is declared at a reaction, a normal attack
is launched and then the next attack begins the sequence with an INIT roll
of 0 .

The penalties are -40 for the first instant attack, -50 for the next one,
and -60 for all following instant attacks.  The first instant attack is
defined as the first attack to happen after the adjusted initiative.

As with pre-sets the actions must be declared at the reaction.  Each action
must be specifically declared.  One can declare up to (RANK + DRIVE/3)
actions.  Recurring loops are possible.  For instance: I block high and then
I hit him again and again and again and don't stop till he is dead......

ON KI FOCUS

Ki Focus is a primary skill that allows the user to pour KI(MEN) into damage
and to-hit chance.  It takes 10 counts to do, and is good for one action.
The to-hit bonus for this is limited to the Raw Success Chance(RSC-
RANK*10+LVF), and the DAM bonus is limited to the max normal damage of the
attack.  Adds RANK/4 to-hit or RANK/8 in damage per MEN used.

It is a prerequisite for several ""monkish"" skills: Body Control, Iron Skin,
Reduce Exhaustion.

ON TRANCE (Mage Trance, Battle Trance, Ki Trance etc.)

Trances are primary skills that allow the character to enter an altered
state focused in a particular area.  On entering the trance the appropriate
perception is activated and all other perceptions are cut in half.  The
trance will make that perception and all applicable skills easier (15% + 3%
per rank).  You must roll to enter a trance, but no success levels can be
used to modify the to-hit mods.  It takes 30 counts to activate.

The to-hit bonuses are limited to the raw success chance of the primary
skill being modified

ON KATA

A Kata (a Japanese word for a martial art form) is a series of specific
skills strung together to be performed sequentially as a training tool and
to develop speed, flow, and prowess in a particular, specific set of uses of
the skills in the kata.

Kata typically refers to martial skills, but it doesn't need to be. Any
group of skills could be put together into a kata. The key is that the
skills need to have specific applications. For instance, strikes need to
specify high, low, or mid-range strikes, and they need to specify support
skills used- if any.

A Kata is a support skill to all the skills in its umbrella.  It adds 3% per
RANK to-hit, and RANK in INIT to all of its skills.  All the actions in the
Kata are done as Instant Attacks.

They are organized into ""sequences"" of 2-5 actions with reactions in
between.  One can enter or leave a sequence at the reactions in-between and
those reactions re-set the Instant Attacks. Breaking the Kata at a
non-reaction, or in the middle of a sequence,  carries a +8 penalty to the
character's next INIT (double the penalty for missing a normal action).

The Kata would have to be activated with a successful roll, though no crit
would be possible as in all support skills.  It takes 4 counts to activate a
Kata. Every sequence written into a Kata beyond the first adds -10% to the
activation roll of the Kata.

Summary:
Kata are composed of a number of sequences.
Each sequence has 2-5 actions.
Each sequence is treated as a series of instant attacks.
The first action of a sequence is a normal attack.
Breakout can occur between sequences, or with a penalty.
Katas are 'simple activation' skills, with no crit potential.
Kata skills add 3% per rank to all actions in the kata.

BEGIN EXAMPLE:

Bob the Paladin decides he wants to use his ""squish 'em, gish 'em, turn 'em""
Kata.

COUNT 0

(1)He rolls a reaction.  He reacts in 2 counts.

COUNT 2

(2)When his reaction comes he says 'I activate ""squish 'em, gish 'em, turn
'em"" '.    He declares what sequence he will use(this Kata only has one) and
that he will start right into the Kata. (SEE OPTION 2 BELOW)
It takes him 4 counts to do this.

COUNT 6

(3)He rolls his Kata skill as a Primary and succeeds.  He automatically gets
a zero initiative roll because he is instant attacking and starts the action
on count seven.  He gets  all his SPD as ACT points.  It takes him 2 counts
after ACT mods to squish.

COUNT 8

(4) He squishes successfully even with the -40(modified by RANK*3 in the
KATA).  He starts right into gishing.  It takes him 2 counts after ACT mods.

COUNT 10

(5)He gishes successfully even with a -50(modified by RANK*3 in the KATA).
He starts his 10-count ""Prot vs. Nasties"".  It takes him five counts after
ACT mods.

COUNT 15

(6)He rolls his Turn successfully despite the -60 (modified by RANK*3 in the
KATA). He rolls a reaction roll- now 3 seconds after deciding to go into the
Kata in the first place.

OPTION 2: After successfully rolling KATA(in ct 6 of the example), you can
roll a reaction(instead of instant attacking) and then act so that the first
action of the Kata isn't at -40, it is as a normal action, and the second
action is the first instant attack.

ON FEINTS

A feint is a false attack designed to create an enhanced opportunity to
strike and an opening in an opponent's defense. It is a contest between the
feinter's skill at feint and the opponent's perception. Feint is a support
skill.

The feinter first strikes with the feint to draw away the opponent's
defenses.  The feint's speed is weapon speed(WSD) of the weapon used,
divided by two.   The Success Level(SL) of the feint is determined as a
contest of skills between the feinter's feint and the perception of their
opponent.  Then, the feinter rolls reaction as per pre-set and attacks with
the real attack.

The formula for the success of a feint is:

FSC = FSC of Feint as a primary skill(it can use the weapon skill as a
secondary)

The success of the feint is based on the Success Level of the Opponent's
Perception roll.  The SLs the feinter generated are then subtracted from
their opponent's perception SLs.   So:

SL of feint = SL(opponent's perception) - SL(feint roll)

A successful feint adds 40% to-hit, halves opponent's defense, and increases
ACT by 10.
An unsuccessful feint subtracts 40% to-hit, and subtracts 8 from the
feinter's next INIT.

Here is an example of Bob the Paladin feinting:

BEGIN EXAMPLE

(BOB finishes up an action and announces he is going to feint with his
sword.)

COUNT 0

BOB: I am going to feint.

(He rolls initiative, modified by his skill in feint with sword as a
secondary.)

BOB: I will react in 2 counts!

COUNT 2

GM: There is a possible opening to the shoulder. (Generated by random
location chart)

Bob: I feint an attack to the shoulder to draw his weapon away from his
head.

(Bob determines that his sword feint-at half his normal weapon speed, then
modified by his ACT points- will take 2 counts)

COUNT 4

(Bob rolls his feint.  GM rolls defenders perception.  Then he subtracts the
feinter's SLs from the opponent's perception SLs.  In this case, the
opponent fails.)

GM: An opening appears at the defender's head.

(Bob rolls his pre-set initiative.  It comes to 1 count.)

COUNT 5

(Bob determines how long his real attack takes including the feint mods
etc-say 3 counts-)

Bob: I attack and will hit in 3 counts!

COUNT 8

Bob: I roll to hit. (Bob rolls to-hit at called shot minuses for head but at
plus 40 for the successful feint and only taking half the defender's
defense.)   I hit!!!  Yea!!!!

(Bob rolls reaction to do some new action that he announces now.  If he had
failed the feint he would have lost 8 points of his INIT on this roll....)

END EXAMPLE

--- --- ---
         ON MOVEMENT MODS

It is exceedingly difficult to target an opponent that is moving.
Therefore these are the mods:

If you are moving at all: -40% to-hit
(Possible support skill: Shoot-While-Move.  Adds 3% per rank to your shot.)

If your target is moving at all: -40% to-hit
(Possible support skill: Targeting Perception.  If you make an ACTIVE
targeting perception- i.e. follow the target, lead the target- that is
successfull you cut all the target based movement mods in half- including
the velocity differential.)

For every foot per count your velocities are different: -10% to-hit.
(NOTE: If the velocity differential is at a significant angle- less than 45
degrees- then you may reduce the minuses in direct relation to the angle*2
as a percentage.  I.e. If it is at 45 degrees then you can  take 90% of the
velocity differential minuses[9% per ft/ct instead of ten]. If it is heading
straight towards or straight away it is 0% and you take no velocity
differential but still take the opponent moving mod.)

An opponent is defined as moving if they:
(a) have a velocity greater than 1 ft/count, or
(b) are engaged in a maneuver skill of some sort (dodge, acrobatics,
gymnastics, running, swimming, falling, actively riding).  Climbing or
defense is usually not counted unless the climber/defender can fulfill
condition (a).

Another mod is ""Unstable Platform"": -40%.  Includes: moving cars,
helicopters, crumbling/unsteady standing/kneeling/lying surface

          APPENDIX 1 - ENDURANCE RESEARCH
>From Jim Mochel on 1/5/98:

Ahh. This harkens back to the good old days of game design ! Here, for those
who never had to listen to me on this topic :-), is a quick summary of the
research I did for SH. Muscle fatigue models just as you might expect , with
expenditures of stored energy (stage 1) up to the point where the body
starts trying to bring in other energy reserves (stage 2) , then when those
are exhausted, continued exercise causes damage to the tissue (stage 3).
Stage 1 expenditures are gained back quickly (in hours) while stage 2
expenditures take days to recover from.
Fatigue from aerobic activity is related but not necessarily linked. As a
person starts exercising their breathing deepens to bring in more oxygen for
burning energy. This continues with the increase of activity until the point
where the respiratory system is no longer able to bring in enough oxygen
(the famous oxygen debt). At this point the body starts burning stored
oxygen (in other forms). What differs for many activities is the percentage
of stored versus intake oxygen being used.
Sprinters go into oxygen debt very quickly and experience much less muscular
fatigue for a given event than marathon runners who expend a continuous but
small percentage of stored oxygen throughout the race. Muscular fatigue by
that time is often the main recovery item.

The oxygen pool does increase in size as a result of training but it is not
that elastic. The amount of stored oxygen is always a much smaller amount
than could be desired. Experienced athletes (Cyclists and Runners have been
extensively studied) simply expend less energy per action.

Oxygen debt is recovered very quickly (AKA Second Wind) (scale: minutes) but
you recover less effectively each successive time you blow through that pool
of energy.
Recovery from extended labor appears to be a _relatively_ constant value.
Oxygen debt recovers in minutes, stored muscular energy in days, damage in
weeks... And the variation is not that great between person to person.

>Skills can be used in a variety of ways and come in several types.  The
>types of skills are: primary, secondary, tertiary, general, and support.
>There is an optional type called related skills discussed here as well.

Um.. no.

""Primary"", ""Secondary"", and ""Tertiary"" are, as far as I know, different
ways of using a skill, *not* different types of skill.

E-man, for instance, has skills in Weaving, Rug-Making, and Tie Knots.  
He may, if circumstances warrant use any of these as a primary skill, to 
weave, make rugs, or tie knots.  He may also use Rug-making as a primary, 
Weaving as a secondary, and Tie Knots as a tertiary, and get a better 
chance to make a rug.

It is my understanding that related skills work similarly; if E-man had 
no Net-Making skill, but wished to help out some fishermen, he could use
Tie Knots as a related skill, and get some sort of similarity bonus, 
based on the GM's concept of how close the skills were.  Again, it is not 
a different *type* of skill, just another way to *use* a regular skill.

I would suggest ""Basic"", ""General"", and ""Support"" skills.  Cover 
different uses of regular skills later on.  

>Most skills can be used in at least three ways: A skill that is used as 
>the Primary skill for a given roll may be used as a Secondary, Tertiary, 
>or even General Skill for a later roll, depending on the task at hand.

Like here!  <g>

How much crossover is there between 'general' and 'regular' skills? 
Unless there is a lot, you might want to consider not allowing it except
as a special (GM-approved) case.

>Primary Skills
>Secondary Skills
>Tertiary Skills
>Related Skills (Optional Rule)


Oddly enough, the example you give here are looser than what I would use
on my own.

""Pilot Helicopter"", for instance, I would call a tertiary to ""Drive Car""; 
they both involve movement through space in a vehicle, for instance, but
helicopters involve a very different set of mechanics [both for the
actions required and the physics involved] for turning, braking, and 
dealing with unpleasant terrain. 

I would be in favor of simplifying all this [surprise!] by defining
""secondary"" as ""sharing the same basic mechanics or knowledge"" and
""tertiary"" as ""Operate in the same general area""

I would even suggest handling 'related' skills as secondaries, but not
charging unfamiliarity mods.


>Support Skills

>There is no limit to the number of support skills one can use with a 
>primary so long as one is performing the action they apply to. 

Good.  Very good.

>If you have unused support skills they may be used as secondaries (see
>description above).

Bad.  Very bad.

If I have a support skill, why should I bother using the appropriate 
technique?  If I can get the same +3% from using it as a secondary, why 
should I take the minuses to actually use the action that the skill was
designed for?

I would strongly recommend using 'extra' support skills as tertiaries, 
not as secondaries.

>NOTE: Some support skills must be rolled against as a primary to 
>""activate"" their effect.  There are two kinds of this roll- the 
>activation roll and the use roll.

I thought support skills weren't rolled against?  Is this a change, or 
just a leftover?


>The Activation roll:
>This is a binary on/off roll- the roll must be successful to use the 
>support skill but there are no critical effects possible to-hit. Success
>levels can be used, though, to generate any non to-hit related bonuses.

Not needed.  The skill you are rolling against is not a 'to hit' skill.
My Longsword skill hits people; my Florentine skill does not.  The part 
you should be worried about is the 'damage' or 'effect' part.  If I get 
4 SL's activating my Florentine skill, can I get twice the effect, or
6% per rank?

Skills that hit don't get bonuses to their 'to-hit' chance anyway.. they
have already hit by making their roll.  You should rewrite this to be more
in tune with current mechanics.

>The Use roll:
>In this case the support skill is rolled as a primary, with the main 
>skill as a secondary.  Typically this is as a contest of skills.  In 
>that case the roll is treated as a primary.  Feint is an example of a 
>use roll skill.

Why is this a support skill, is the normal use is as a regular skill?

Feint, for instance, strikes me as an excellent example of a combat
maneuver skill.  (Lunge might be another, but that is more arguable.)
A fighter feints as an action.  It takes time, and it must be reacted
for, before and after.  Rather than offering mods to an unusual attack,
it is rolled as a seperate attack, affecting the opponent's perception
rather than their physical integrity.

Why not list it as a regular skill, use the appropriate weapon skill as
a secondary (applied when used; a simple-enough mod and done anyway), and
be done with it?  That seems simpler to me than shoe-horning it into the
Support Skill category.


>  Note that some support skills do not contribute to-hit or def:

Since you have already referred people to Appendix G, this should go
there as well.  Having in the main text is confusing, since you have just 
been talking generalities.


>General Skills

>Only skills that are primaries should be put in a general skill.

???

So if I use my ""S:Binding"" as a secondary to mu ""S:Unbinding"", I can't
use ""W:Binding"" as a General Skill for the ""S:Binding""???

I know this is not what you mean, but it is very poorly stated.

Perhaps: ""A General Skill group should not include Support Skills or
other General Skills.""  (Or something else, if that's not what you 
want.)


>          ON CRITICALS/SUCCESS LEVELS

Pretty good here, actually.  I like the way it's developed.

[Moment of silence here for non-causal combat scenes, victim of
a Discipline III system chance.]

>     Effect of Success Levels on Endurance

1 - ( 1 / (SL+2) )     Cool Formula.  (Still.)

You might want a damage table, too, complete with formula at the end.

>     Effect of Success Levels on INIT points

2 * SL

Formulas at the end of tables will help calculate non-table values and
let us spreadsheet fanatics do our work. (Bwahahaha!)

They will also let you keep the tables short and representative, rather
than long and comprehensive.  Think of the time you'll save!

>Example:

Thanks for clearing those up.  Personally, I'm gonna be seriously looking
at 2 SL to Endurance (1/2 cost) for almost everything I do well.


>          ON CONTEST OF SKILLS

I like it.

The 'defense' mods should be in all the combat examples or none of them,
though.

I don't think we were using that much of the granularity, anyway.


>          ON ENDURANCE

>META-EXHAUSTION: M-EXT comes off END as well.

You might want to mention that M-EXT affect both END and MEN.  Otherwise,
the natural assumption will be that the two pools remain separate.  (At
least, that was *my* assumption, until aprised of the reality.)

>     Effect of Success Levels on Endurance

Haven't I seen this somewhere before?  <g>

I actually like having it in both places.


>OPTIONAL RULE(DESIGN LEVEL):
> Endurance costs for skills would be:  COST - RANK*(.05*COST) 
>with the COSTnever dropping to zero.

Messy, but so is most of the design-level stuff.  I'm not going to bother
with it unless it seems to have a huge advantage to me, so I don't really
care.  People who do care seem to feel it's realistic, and that's good
enough for me.


>          ON TIME

>This is based on a series of variables including the primary stats AGL,
>DSC, and INT; the secondary stats of Physical Speed(PSPD) or Mental 
>Speed(MSPD); the Total Level Factor of the character(TLF); the Physical 
>Level Factor(PLF) or Mental Level Factor(MLF), and the Level Factor of 
>the skill being used in the action.  This ""initiative"" also includes the
>person's RANK in the skill about to be used, and in the similar skills
>supporting it, the character's physical well-being, mental state, and 
>other situational modifiers.  

That may be a little too much information for a general intro to the
subject.

How about: ""This is based on the character's stats, their skill levels 
in both the skill being used and other, supporting skills, and their 
knowledge of similar skills.  Modifiers may be applied for physical or 
mental condition, previous successful or failed actions, and the 
situation in general.""

> To simulate the variability of our interface with the world

<cough>

Are you being paid by the word, here?

You might want to go over some of your text with a conscious eye toward
simplifying the language.  BT is complicated enough without making it
seem worse.

>In each count there is an action phase and then a reaction phase.

...But each person does reaction, then next action.

If I've got this right...

Count n: Any actions finishing now go off.  
           --Rolls are made, effects declared.
         People react
           --Rolls are made, people wait

So the GM is on an act/react cycle, and the players are on a react/act
cycle.  Hokay.  Thanks.

>Each action has a speed assigned to it.
>This speed is also a measure of the ""counts"" it takes to perform the 
>action.

""Also""?  What else is it doing?  This should be the primary description
of the number.


>          ON SPEED

Uh-oh.

Actually, it looks pretty good.  Couple of minor points...

>To buy 1 ACT => 10% to-hit or 3 points of damage(only for muscle-powered,
>non-stored-energy weapons) or 1 negative initiative

What about spells?

>8 ACTION points will buy you a full passive perception or general skill 
>activation.

Passive skills are on a 'parallel track', right?  E-man, for instance,
would react, declare his activation of ""W:Air"" and start his air shield.
Assuming no ACT points, he takes 8 counts for the wizardry and 10 for 
the sorcery, thus having an activated wizardy to help with the air spell.

If this isn't right, could you perhaps go over the proper way to do this?


>          ON SETUP

Looks good.

> ON INSTANT ATTACK

>As with pre-sets the actions must be declared at the reaction.

At the *previous* reaction.. NOT the one that is zeroed. (Or halved, for
presets.)

You might want to emphasize the declare-ahead part.


> ON KATA

>A Kata is a support skill to all the skills in its umbrella.

Mechanically, this means that katas can include an unlimited number of
skills.

Didn't you have some sort of DRIVE-based limit?

>The Kata would have to be activated with a successful roll, though no 
>crit would be possible as in all support skills.

Wrong.  Crits are possible.  They just cannot be used to affect the 
3%/level effect of the Kata skill.

People wanting to speed up the activation, or reduce the INIT for the 
next action, will certainly want crit effects, and should have them.

>All the actions in the Kata are done as Instant Attacks.

>Summary:
>The first action of a sequence is a normal attack.

Um, you might want to settle on one or the other, here.

I see no reason that activating the Kata can't be declared, along with an
instant attack or preset for the next action, which would be the first
attack.

Of course, I also see no reason the Kata, like Mage Trance or Battle 
Trance, can't be a regular skill.  Like them, it involves 'mode' changes, 
and not variant styles on the attacks.  Like them, it is rolled as a
primary, instead of adding mods to counter other mods.

I would also make ""Florentine"" a mode skill.  Maybe the power is going
to my head, here.

> ON FEINTS

I stand by my 'Feint' comments above.  (Way up top, near 'Support 
Skills'.)

> Here is an example of Bob the Paladin feinting

Not how Bob uses his feint as a separate skill, reacting before and
after its use.  See how this is different from his use of, say, 
Great Blow.


>         ON MOVEMENT MODS

> If you are moving at all: -40% to-hit

> If your target is moving at all: -40% to-hit

>Another mod is ""Unstable Platform"": -40%.

So... shooting at a moving target from a helicopter is -120% ?

Or is ""Unstable Platform"" just another way of saying ""You are Moving""?



  ==

Looks really good so far, Alex.  Most of my commentary is about stylistic
matters, and a good portion of the rest is questions about things that are
unclear to me.

About the only major quibble I have is with your skill categorizations, 
and I suspect I stated my view on that enough above, without reiterating 
it here.

                        -Myth.

          ON TYPES OF SKILLS

In Bardic Tales the interface between the player and the actions their
character takes is the ""skills"" of the character.  A skill is a piece of
knowledge or training or automatic behavior that a character has that allows
them to take an action.  Skills include things like knowing how to build a
car, flying a helicopter, swinging a sword in combat, identifying someone's
emotional state, noticing a hidden ambusher, or cooking a great ham.

Skills can be used in a variety of ways and come in several types.  The
types of skills are: primary, secondary, tertiary, general, and support.
There is an optional type called related skills discussed here as well.

All skills in Bardic Tales fit into one or more of these categories. How to
apply the skill depends on what category it is in. Bear in mind that these
types of skills only apply on a per application basis. Most skills can be
used in at least three ways: A skill that is used as the Primary skill for a
given roll may be used as a Secondary, Tertiary, or even General Skill for a
later roll, depending on the task at hand.

Some of these skills merely act as modifiers while others need to be rolled.
This skill breakdown is an attempt to codify and methodize something that in
real life is the result of at least hundreds of factors and conditions.
This is a vast simplification.  Please bear that in mind.

***
Primary Skills

Primary skills are the primary use of the skill. If you were shooting
someone with a Walther PPK, for example, your pistol skill would be the
primary skill.   If you do not have a skill in the correct area your RANK is
considered to be 0 (unless you have a related skill.  See the Option Rule
re: Related Skills)

Primary skills are calculated by adding RANK*10 to Level Factor(LVF).  This
gives the Base Success Chance(BSC). The BSC can be modified by situation and
environmental factors.  There can only be one primary skill for each action.

Primary skills add ([RANK] - 2) to both SPeeD(SPD) and EFFect(DAM).

Primary Skill Effect Summary:
BC=10%/RANK,  SPD=RANK -2,  DAM=RANK-2

***
Secondary Skills

Secondary skills are skills that are closely related to the primary, that
use similar tools, are appropriate lore skills, or operate in the same
general area.  They add to the person's chance, speed and effectiveness with
a particular skill.

Here is a list of some primaries and their possible secondaries:
  Pistol: rifle and Targeting Perception
  Fist: Foot and Elbow-Strike
  Power Blast: Psi Shield and SCF Set-up
  Sword: Knife and Mace
  Driving Car: Pilot Helicopter and Car Lore

Secondary skills are calculated as [RANK]*3 added to the primary skill they
are supporting.  You can only pick two secondary skills for each primary
skill roll.

Secondary skills add ([RANK] - 2)/2 to both the SPD and DAM of the primary
skill. The value for these is never negative.

Secondary Skill Effect Summary:
BC = 3%/RANK,  SPD = (RANK - 2)/2,  DAM = (RANK - 2)/2

***
Tertiary Skills

Tertiary skills are vaguely related skills that assist the character in
performing the primary skill.  Any skill that can be a secondary can also be
a tertiary, and even a vague connection to the primary skill is usually
sufficient to convince the GM to let you use a skill as a tertiary!:-)

Tertiary skills are calculated as [RANK]*1% added to the primary. You can
only pick two tertiary skills for each primary skill roll.

Tertiary skills do not add SPD and DAM bonuses.

Tertiary Skill Effect Summary:
BC = 1%/RANK

***
Support Skills

Support skills are skills which are particularly designed to support or
enhance another skill. They often model a variation or particular action
that is a use of a primary skill. Some examples are: Florentine, Parry,
Called Shot, Quickstrike, Great Blow, Lunge, etc.

Support Skills are typically linked to a family of skills not just one
particular skill. You wouldn't have ""Quickstrike: Long Sword"" you would have
""Quickstrike: Bladed Weapons"". Support skills are locked- not any skill can
be a support skill.  The prefix for a support skill is ""S:"".

There is no limit to the number of support skills one can use with a primary
so long as one is performing the action they apply to. If you have unused
support skills they may be used as secondaries(see description above).

NOTE: Some support skills must be rolled against as a primary to ""activate""
their effect.  There are two kinds of this roll- the activation roll and the
use roll.

The Activation roll:
This is a binary on/off roll- the roll must be successful to use the support
skill but there are no critical effects possible to-hit. Success levels can
be used, though, to generate any non to-hit related bonuses.  These
activation rolls typically take 4 counts.  Kata and Florentine are examples
of support skills that one must activate.

The Use roll:
In this case the support skill is rolled as a primary, with the main skill
as a secondary.  Typically this is as a contest of skills.  In that case the
roll is treated as a primary.  Feint is an example of a use roll skill.  If
a support skill requires a use roll it will be detailed in the skill
description- support skills default to the mode described elsewhere in this
section.

Support skills do not add SPD or DAM bonuses unless they are specifically
designed to do so. If not specified elsewhere they add 3% per [RANK].
However, each support skill can have its own special functions so refer to
<Appendix G: Combat Options and Support Skills> in the User's Guide.

  Note that some support skills do not contribute to-hit or def:
Quickstrike,   Quickdraw

  Some do not contribute to SPD: Called Shot, Set-Up, Evasion, Armor
Wearing, Great Blow

  Some do not contribute to DAM: Called Shot, Quick Strike, Quick Draw,
  Feint, Parry, Set-up. Evasion, Armor Wearing, Instant Attack, Great Blow

Support skills can go above the negative modifier for a skill. (i.e. a RANK
15 Florentine character gets +45% and the minus is only minus 40%.  This
person is 5% better florentining than not florentining.)

Support Skill Effect Summary:
BC = 3%/RANK (sometimes) - VARIES WITH SKILL DESCRIPTION. SEE RULES OR GM.

***
General Skills

General skills are umbrella skills that include a whole group of skills in
their domain. Martial styles and Schools of Wizardry are examples of general
skills. Only skills that are primaries should be put in a general skill. A
framework for a generic General skill could include:

  Appropriate Lore skill
  Appropriate Perception skill
  + 5 or so Primary skills that make the pattern.

Note that the content of a general skill is fairly flexible.  It is not
locked in stone.  Some general skills require an activation roll- that is
the character must use an action - or ACT points- to roll the General skill
as a primary to begin applying the mods to their skills.
General skills are locked- not any skill can be a general skill.  The prefix
for a general skill is either G: or W: .

General skills add 3% to-hit per rank, and (RANK - 2)/2 SPD/DAM. Most things
have at least one applicable General skill.   You can only have one general
skill per primary skill roll.

Parentheses indicate support skills that should be taken to complete the
General.

***
Related Skills (Optional Rule)

A BT Related Skill is a non-additive replacement skill for a primary skill.
It must be close enough to the primary skill that a percentage of it can be
applied to the success chance INSTEAD of the that primary skill. Example:

I have a RANK 5 in drive truck. I jump in the car. I have RANK 1 in Drive
car. They are RELATED at 4/5. This means when I calculate out my chance to
drive car, I can use 4/5 of my truck RANK to drive the car INSTEAD OF the
RANK 1 in Drive Car. It is useful because if you can drive a truck at rank 5
you can CERTAINLY drive a car at least 60-80% of your chance. However they
are not really additive- you shouldn't get 3/4 or 4/5 of your truck RANK to
add to your CAR rank because the principles are very similar.
However you can use your RANK one in DRIVE CAR as a secondary (3% per rank,
etc)

***
SKILL CHANCES

All this is designed to generate the percentage chance of the character
fulfilling on a particular task.  This final chance is called the Final
Success Chance(FSC).  The formula summarizing the effects of the various
skill types on the FSC is:

FSC = Primary Skill Rank *10
      + [Secondary Skill Rank] *3 + [Secondary Skill Rank] *3
      + [Tertiary Skill Rank] + [Tertiary Skill Rank]
      + [General Skill Rank] *3
      + [Any Support Skills' Ranks] *3
      + [Appropriate Level Factor]
      + MODS + DIFF_MOD

Not every slot will be filled for every action- a character may not have
applicable skills for any of the slots. Note that square brackets [ ] around
a value means that value is truncated(i.e. 4.6 becomes 4). More information
on SITUATIONAL MODS can be found in the success chance section of Chapter 2:
System Rules and in the Situational Modifiers table in Chapter 3: Combat

RAW SUCCESS CHANCE(RSC) = Primary*10 + LVF

BASE SUCCESS CHANCE(BSC) = Primary*10 + LVF + DIFF_MOD

FINAL SUCCESS CHANCE(FSC) = Primary*10 +2Secondaries*3 + 2Tertiaries*1 +
1General*3 + Supportskills*3 + LVF + DIFF_MOD + MODS

DIFF_MOD = Difficulty modifier for the action or tool being used.
MODS= Situational, or environmental modifiers to the action
NOTE: No skill can appear in the Final Success chance more than once.

          ON CRITICALS/SUCCESS LEVELS

It is axiomatic to most RPGs and realism simulations that there is a chance
for particularly good successes.  Out of this, the concept of ""criticals"" or
""success levels"" comes.
In BT the distinctions are now made along these breakpoints:

SN = Success number = number you need to roll to succeed in the skill- this
is your FSC.

CSN = Critical Success Number = 1/4 of your SN.

CFN = Critical Failure Number = SN + 50

SL = Success Level

NOTE: In these discussions we will speak about damage and effect
interchangeably.  Mostly this is an artifact of the skill system growing out
of a gaming system that focused on modeling weapon effects.  However the
pluses to Damage(DAM), and the multipliers for effect are both modeling the
same area.  For purposes of weapons effect is damage and for purposes of
non-weapon skills DAM is the same as effect.

     Effect of Success Levels on Effect
At or under the success number:  SL 1  skill applied,half-effect
At or under half the SN:         SL 2        full-effect
At or under quarter the SN(CSN): SL 3        1.5* effect
At or under CSN-10:              SL 4        2* effect
At or under CSN-20:              SL 5        2.5* effect
At or under CSN-30:              SL 6        3* effect etc.

     Success Levels also measure levels of failure:
Over the success number:    SL +0  missed to-hit, action not successful
Over SN by 50(CFN):         SL -1  -20% to save or recovery roll
Over CFN+10:                SL -2  -40% to save or recovery roll
Over CFN+20:                SL -3  -60% to save or recovery roll
Over CFN+30:                SL -4  -80% to save or recovery roll

To get the damage modifier of a hit, divide the SL by 2.  That is the effect
multiplier.  This assumes you are using your SLs for effect.  Negative SLs
subtract 20% per negative SL from the appropriate save or recovery roll.

You could also use them for reducing END cost(see Endurance section for
success level effect on Endurance), or increasing effect duration(mechanism
to be determined), or effect control(mechanism to be determined), or some
other things I am sure you will all think of....

NOTE: It is advisable to always put at least one level of success into
effect/damage or you will have no effect!:-)(Although I can see in a
proactive fight you might put all your success levels into endurance cost or
showmanship or something...)

     Effect of Success Levels on Endurance
1 x2/3
2 x1/2
3 x2/5
4 x1/3
5 x2/7
6 x1/4
...
     Effect of Success Levels on INIT points
SL INIT
1  +2
2  +4
3  +6
4  +8
5  +10
6  +12

NOTE:  INIT points from SL(SL*1.5, round down) go towards the reaction
IMMEDIATELY after the action (i.e. the character is so much smoother with
the action they can transition into the next action better.
...
The SL is the amount {(CSN - number rolled)/10 + 3 [rounded down]} for all
successes below SL 2.

Example:

SN=100 so CSN=25.

I roll a 66.  This is a SL 1. One level of success.
*
I roll a 43.  That is a SL 2.  It is two levels of success to apply
to whatever I want.  One could apply both levels to effect(full damage), OR
one level to effect(1/2 damage) and one level to reducing endurance(2/3
endurance cost).
*
I roll a 22.  That is a SL 3.  It is three levels of success to play
with.
I could put one to Endurance(2/3 cost) and two to effect(full damage)
or all three to effect(1.5*damage)
or one to INIT points(2 points), one to Endurance(2/3 cost), and one to
Effect(.5*damage).
*
I roll a 13.  That is a SL 4.  It is four levels of success to play with.
I could put three to effect(1.5*damage) and one to endurance(2/3 cost),
or one to effect(1.5*damage) and three to endurance(2/5 cost), etc.

End Example.

          ON CONTEST OF SKILLS

I think from now on all contests of skills between characters will be done
with Success Levels instead of ""How much you made it"".

Example 1:  Jane the Jackknife is sneaking up on Gary the Guard.  Jane has a
Move Silently success chance of 100%.  Gary has an Awareness of 120% so his
Awareness success chance to hear Jane sneaking up on him is 120%.
Jane rolls a 43 on her Move Silently.  This is Success Level 2(under half).
Gary rolls a 48 on his awareness.   This is Success Level 2 as well.
Therefore Gary has SL 0 in his perception and does not hear Jane.

Example 2: Alden the Active is swinging his Bastard Sword at Chuck the
Cheeky.  Chuck(assuming appropriate initiative and perception) decides to
parry with his open hand.  Alden's swing chance is 210%.  Chuck's parry
chance(with parry and non-weapon mods) is 160%.  Alden rolls a 98, giving
him SL 2.  Chuck rolls a 12, giving him SL 4.  Alden's adjusted SL is now
negative two: (2-4=-2).  Thus he has two levels of failure on his sword
swing, and probably has to roll to hold on to his sword.

Example 3: Alden the Active gets really mad and decides to Great Blow Chuck
the Cheeky.  He swings.  Chuck opts to do an active defense.  He rolls his
active defense.  Alden gets an amazing 4 SLs on his swing.  Chuck gets 3 SLs
on his DEfense skill.  Thus Alden's adjusted SL for his Great Blow is 1.  So
Chuck gets hit by a SL 1 sword blow from Alden.

Example 4: Alden the Active gets even madder and decides to take Chuck the
Cheeky's head off.  He swings.  His chance is 210% but Chuck's defense is
90.  Alden FSC drops to 120%.  He rolls a 42.  This is success level 2.
Chuck opts to do an active defense.  He has 160% chance.  He rolls a 39 on
his active defense.   Chuck gets 3 SLs on his Defense skill.  Thus Alden's
adjusted SL for his attack is negative one, or SL-1.  So Alden misses
despite his good roll!

PROS:
-It levels the playing field a little.  Lucky low-level people have more
chance of success against high-level people.
-You can use the SL difference to determine things like how much information
the guard got about the person sneaking up on them, etc. how well did she
win the arm wrestling, how critical was the parry....
-it is much faster- all you need to know is what success level you are in
not the exact percentage.  Less addition /subtraction etc.

CONS:
-Slight loss of granularity in the percentages
-It levels the playing field.:-)

          ON ENDURANCE

In this conversation Physical and Mental Endurances are equivalent.
Therefore we refer to END and EXT- but these refer to both Physical
Endurance(END) and Mental Endurance(MEN).  Likewise for exhaustion.
Physical and Mental endurance and exhaustion are recovered simultaneously
and identically.

Currently END, EXT, and M-EXT (Endurance, Exhaustion, and Meta-Exhaustion)
use the idea that Endurance is like a pool of energy that you have a certain
amount of and that increases as one becomes more skilled.  Actions use up
Endurance like fuel.

***
ENDURANCE:  Basic ""fuel unit"".
It returns after use at 1 per ten counts... usually all back in 3-5 minutes.
Resting or sleeping doubles the return rate.

***
EXHAUSTION: EXT comes off the top of END at a rate of 1 per 10 END expended.
It returns at 1 per two hours of rest, 2 per hour of light sleep, 4 per hour
of medium sleep, and 8 per hour of full deep sleep.  Meals can also restore
1-3 EXT three times a day.  Meditation is as medium sleep.

***
META-EXHAUSTION: M-EXT comes off END as well.  One accumulates one M-EXT for
every 10 EXT one accumulates.
It returns at a rate of: 1 per 4 hours of complete rest(not doing any
activity- not expending more than 20 endurance in an hour), 1 per 2 hours of
deep sleep(Deep sleep is usually achieved in the third hour of sleep)

***
Your first hour of sleep is light sleep and gives you 2 EXT, .25 M-EXT
Your second hour of sleep is medium sleep and gives you 4 EXT,.25 M-EXT
All following hours of sleep are deep sleep and give you 8 EXT,.5 M-EXT

If a character is moving or acting at some percentage of full effort
(travelling with slower companions, taking their time, only punching white
belts) they only expend that percentage of the END cost of the action.  i.e.
if a character has a walk of 1.4 and the group is moving at .7, she only
expends 50% of the END cost for that type of movement.

Levels of critical can be used to decrease endurance cost just like they can
be used to increase damage.  The following table describes the effect:

     Effect of Success Levels on Endurance
1 x2/3
2 x1/2
3 x2/5
4 x1/3
5 x2/7
6 x1/4
...
NOTE: In most cases you need to put at least one success level in a roll to
effect or there will be 0 effect.  :-)  So usually you would never put all
your success levels towards reducing endurance.

***
OPTIONAL RULE:

Whenever the rules call for recovering 1 ENDURANCE, EXHAUSTION, or
META-EXHAUSTION it is read as 1% of the character's endurance.  The amount
of endurance recovered is tallied and then the modifier is applied.
I.e. if a character recovers 54 points over night, and the character evokes
this optional rule, then that is translated to 54% of total and rounded up
to the nearest integer.  This rule will probably only be used by characters
with ENDURANCES over 100... :-)

***
OPTIONAL RULE(DESIGN LEVEL):

PROBABLE: REQUIRES SECONDARY STAT RECONFIGURATION- END AND MEN BASE WOULD
REMAIN THE SAME BUT EXPANSION EFFECTS(LVFs, SKILL EFFECTS) WOULD BE CUT IN
AT LEAST HALF

Endurance costs for skills would be:  COST - RANK*(.05*COST) with the COST
never dropping to zero.
>RNK 1 =  5% reduction
>RNK 2 = 10% reduction
>RNK 3 = 15% reduction
>  (etc.) -           -
RNK 10 = 50% reduction
>  (etc.)
>RNK 20 = 100% reduction (wow)-> becomes 1 END or EXT or M-EXT.

          ON TIME

Managing flow of actions, sequencing of occurrences, and time-flow in Bardic
Tales is modeled by breaking time up into discrete units called counts.
Each count is the equivalent of a fifth of a second.

There is a system called ""initiative"" that manages when a character acts and
reacts in counts.  This is based on a series of variables including the
primary stats AGL, DSC, and INT; the secondary stats of Physical Speed(PSPD)
or Mental Speed(MSPD); the Total Level Factor of the character(TLF); the
Physical Level Factor(PLF) or Mental Level Factor(MLF), and the Level Factor
of the skill being used in the action.  This ""initiative"" also includes the
person's RANK in the skill about to be used, and in the similar skills
supporting it, the character's physical well-being, mental state, and other
situational modifiers.  These variables are all bundled together under a
single number called SPD.

To simulate the variability of our interface with the world, the
""initiative"" is generated by rolling two 6-sided dice and adding them
together and then modifying them by SPD/2(rounded up).  The resultant number
is the number of counts a character must wait until they can start an
action.  This is their ""reaction time"" in counts.

During the course of a combat or specific interaction, the GM will walk
through time count by count. In each count there is an action phase and then
a reaction phase.   When a person ""rolls initiative"" and generates a number,
that number is the number of counts the person takes to ""react"" to their
environment and start an action.  If the number is negative(due to
modifiers) then it is declared as zero counts and the person can declare
what action they are starting in the reaction phase of that count, and it
will start in the action phase of the next count.

All negative initiative(plus SPD/2[rounded down]) gets turned into ACTION
POINTS(ACT), which can be used to speed up the time it actually takes to do
the action.

Each action has a speed assigned to it.  This is called WeaponSpeed(WSD-
this is another layover from the time when all skills were modeling
combat!).  This speed is also a measure of the ""counts"" it takes to perform
the action.   So once the person is finished reacting(in the reaction phase
of the count their reaction completes) they would confirm which action they
were starting in the action phase of the next count.  That would be the
first count of the action.  When they reach the action phase of the count
which is (modified WSD) counts later they would roll their skill roll and
the action would take place.

Some skill options that change this slightly are pre-sets and instant
attacks.  The only difference is that when using a pre-set you roll 2d6/2
instead of 2d6 for the reaction variation.  In an instant attack you proceed
as if you had ROLLED a 0[normally impossible] on your 2d6/2 pre-set roll.

SPEED mechanics are explained in more detail below.

--- --- ---
          ON SPEED

Speed Points(SPD) => the number generated by the character's PSPD/MSPD stat,
plus the LVF/10, plus the RANK modifiers: primary(RANK-2),
secondaries([RANK-2]/2), and general([RANK-2]/2), plus any SPECIAL
POINTS(Support skills like Quickstrike, Environmental variables, Physical
and Mental state of the character)

Initiative points(INIT) => the number subtracted from the characters
initiative roll.  It is equal to half the speed points, rounded up. Is added
to directly by some SUPPORT SKILLS like Kata.

Action Points(ACT) => the points used to speed up actions, perform passive
actions or add to-hit.  It is equal to half the speed points, rounded down.
Is added to directly by some SUPPORT SKILLS like Quickdraw

Negative initiative turns into ACT on a 1 per 1 basis.

Quickstrike generates 1 SPD per RANK.    Kata generates 1 INIT per RANK.  A
specific Quickdraw skill generates 1 ACT per RANK.

To buy 1 ACT => 10% to-hit or 3 points of damage(only for muscle-powered,
non-stored-energy weapons) or 1 negative initiative

One ACT will buy you:  2%-to-hit or 1/3 DAM or 1 count off of a passive
action.

Examples of passive actions: perception[8 counts], support skill
initiation[usually 8 counts], general skill activation[usually 8 counts,
Kata [not a general skill but a support skill that required activation- is 4
counts], etc.  So 8 ACTION points will buy you a full passive perception or
general skill activation.

--- --- ---
          ON SETUP

Set-up in real counts will give you 5% per count and is limited to:

(1) 10 + KIF/2 counts of set-up AND

(2) a maximum value equal to  (RANK*10+LVF)- or the default value(saves,
MAP, etc.)- of the skill being set-up for.

Do not include secondaries or generals in set-up base chance and do not
include the difficulty of the skill.  Only include the RAW SUCCESS CHANCE:
RANK*10 + LVF.  This is because the more difficult actions are where set-up
is really needed and IMO makes the most difference in real-life.

The set-up skill allows you to double the set-up bonus per count for the
first RANK counts of set-up.

ON INSTANT ATTACK

Instant attacks are attacks in which the initiative roll is
automatically adjusted to 0.  It is declared at a reaction, a normal attack
is launched and then the next attack begins the sequence with an INIT roll
of 0 .

The penalties are -40 for the first instant attack, -50 for the next one,
and -60 for all following instant attacks.  The first instant attack is
defined as the first attack to happen after the adjusted initiative.

As with pre-sets the actions must be declared at the reaction.  Each action
must be specifically declared.  One can declare up to (RANK + DRIVE/3)
actions.  Recurring loops are possible.  For instance: I block high and then
I hit him again and again and again and don't stop till he is dead......

ON KI FOCUS

Ki Focus is a primary skill that allows the user to pour KI(MEN) into damage
and to-hit chance.  It takes 10 counts to do, and is good for one action.
The to-hit bonus for this is limited to the Raw Success Chance(RSC-
RANK*10+LVF), and the DAM bonus is limited to the max normal damage of the
attack.  Adds RANK/4 to-hit or RANK/8 in damage per MEN used.

It is a prerequisite for several ""monkish"" skills: Body Control, Iron Skin,
Reduce Exhaustion.

ON TRANCE (Mage Trance, Battle Trance, Ki Trance etc.)

Trances are primary skills that allow the character to enter an altered
state focused in a particular area.  On entering the trance the appropriate
perception is activated and all other perceptions are cut in half.  The
trance will make that perception and all applicable skills easier (15% + 3%
per rank).  You must roll to enter a trance, but no success levels can be
used to modify the to-hit mods.  It takes 30 counts to activate.

The to-hit bonuses are limited to the raw success chance of the primary
skill being modified

ON KATA

A Kata (a Japanese word for a martial art form) is a series of specific
skills strung together to be performed sequentially as a training tool and
to develop speed, flow, and prowess in a particular, specific set of uses of
the skills in the kata.

Kata typically refers to martial skills, but it doesn't need to be. Any
group of skills could be put together into a kata. The key is that the
skills need to have specific applications. For instance, strikes need to
specify high, low, or mid-range strikes, and they need to specify support
skills used- if any.

A Kata is a support skill to all the skills in its umbrella.  It adds 3% per
RANK to-hit, and RANK in INIT to all of its skills.  All the actions in the
Kata are done as Instant Attacks.

They are organized into ""sequences"" of 2-5 actions with reactions in
between.  One can enter or leave a sequence at the reactions in-between and
those reactions re-set the Instant Attacks. Breaking the Kata at a
non-reaction, or in the middle of a sequence,  carries a +8 penalty to the
character's next INIT (double the penalty for missing a normal action).

The Kata would have to be activated with a successful roll, though no crit
would be possible as in all support skills.  It takes 4 counts to activate a
Kata. Every sequence written into a Kata beyond the first adds -10% to the
activation roll of the Kata.

Summary:
Kata are composed of a number of sequences.
Each sequence has 2-5 actions.
Each sequence is treated as a series of instant attacks.
The first action of a sequence is a normal attack.
Breakout can occur between sequences, or with a penalty.
Katas are 'simple activation' skills, with no crit potential.
Kata skills add 3% per rank to all actions in the kata.

BEGIN EXAMPLE:

Bob the Paladin decides he wants to use his ""squish 'em, gish 'em, turn 'em""
Kata.

COUNT 0

(1)He rolls a reaction.  He reacts in 2 counts.

COUNT 2

(2)When his reaction comes he says 'I activate ""squish 'em, gish 'em, turn
'em"" '.    He declares what sequence he will use(this Kata only has one) and
that he will start right into the Kata. (SEE OPTION 2 BELOW)
It takes him 4 counts to do this.

COUNT 6

(3)He rolls his Kata skill as a Primary and succeeds.  He automatically gets
a zero initiative roll because he is instant attacking and starts the action
on count seven.  He gets  all his SPD as ACT points.  It takes him 2 counts
after ACT mods to squish.

COUNT 8

(4) He squishes successfully even with the -40(modified by RANK*3 in the
KATA).  He starts right into gishing.  It takes him 2 counts after ACT mods.

COUNT 10

(5)He gishes successfully even with a -50(modified by RANK*3 in the KATA).
He starts his 10-count ""Prot vs. Nasties"".  It takes him five counts after
ACT mods.

COUNT 15

(6)He rolls his Turn successfully despite the -60 (modified by RANK*3 in the
KATA). He rolls a reaction roll- now 3 seconds after deciding to go into the
Kata in the first place.

OPTION 2: After successfully rolling KATA(in ct 6 of the example), you can
roll a reaction(instead of instant attacking) and then act so that the first
action of the Kata isn't at -40, it is as a normal action, and the second
action is the first instant attack.

ON FEINTS

A feint is a false attack designed to create an enhanced opportunity to
strike and an opening in an opponent's defense. It is a contest between the
feinter's skill at feint and the opponent's perception. Feint is a support
skill.

The feinter first strikes with the feint to draw away the opponent's
defenses.  The feint's speed is weapon speed(WSD) of the weapon used,
divided by two.   The Success Level(SL) of the feint is determined as a
contest of skills between the feinter's feint and the perception of their
opponent.  Then, the feinter rolls reaction as per pre-set and attacks with
the real attack.

The formula for the success of a feint is:

FSC = FSC of Feint as a primary skill(it can use the weapon skill as a
secondary)

The success of the feint is based on the Success Level of the Opponent's
Perception roll.  The SLs the feinter generated are then subtracted from
their opponent's perception SLs.   So:

SL of feint = SL(opponent's perception) - SL(feint roll)

A successful feint adds 40% to-hit, halves opponent's defense, and increases
ACT by 10.
An unsuccessful feint subtracts 40% to-hit, and subtracts 8 from the
feinter's next INIT.

Here is an example of Bob the Paladin feinting:

BEGIN EXAMPLE

(BOB finishes up an action and announces he is going to feint with his
sword.)

COUNT 0

BOB: I am going to feint.

(He rolls initiative, modified by his skill in feint with sword as a
secondary.)

BOB: I will react in 2 counts!

COUNT 2

GM: There is a possible opening to the shoulder. (Generated by random
location chart)

Bob: I feint an attack to the shoulder to draw his weapon away from his
head.

(Bob determines that his sword feint-at half his normal weapon speed, then
modified by his ACT points- will take 2 counts)

COUNT 4

(Bob rolls his feint.  GM rolls defenders perception.  Then he subtracts the
feinter's SLs from the opponent's perception SLs.  In this case, the
opponent fails.)

GM: An opening appears at the defender's head.

(Bob rolls his pre-set initiative.  It comes to 1 count.)

COUNT 5

(Bob determines how long his real attack takes including the feint mods
etc-say 3 counts-)

Bob: I attack and will hit in 3 counts!

COUNT 8

Bob: I roll to hit. (Bob rolls to-hit at called shot minuses for head but at
plus 40 for the successful feint and only taking half the defender's
defense.)   I hit!!!  Yea!!!!

(Bob rolls reaction to do some new action that he announces now.  If he had
failed the feint he would have lost 8 points of his INIT on this roll....)

END EXAMPLE

--- --- ---
         ON MOVEMENT MODS

It is exceedingly difficult to target an opponent that is moving.
Therefore these are the mods:

If you are moving at all: -40% to-hit
(Possible support skill: Shoot-While-Move.  Adds 3% per rank to your shot.)

If your target is moving at all: -40% to-hit
(Possible support skill: Targeting Perception.  If you make an ACTIVE
targeting perception- i.e. follow the target, lead the target- that is
successfull you cut all the target based movement mods in half- including
the velocity differential.)

For every foot per count your velocities are different: -10% to-hit.
(NOTE: If the velocity differential is at a significant angle- less than 45
degrees- then you may reduce the minuses in direct relation to the angle*2
as a percentage.  I.e. If it is at 45 degrees then you can  take 90% of the
velocity differential minuses[9% per ft/ct instead of ten]. If it is heading
straight towards or straight away it is 0% and you take no velocity
differential but still take the opponent moving mod.)

An opponent is defined as moving if they:
(a) have a velocity greater than 1 ft/count, or
(b) are engaged in a maneuver skill of some sort (dodge, acrobatics,
gymnastics, running, swimming, falling, actively riding).  Climbing or
defense is usually not counted unless the climber/defender can fulfill
condition (a).

Another mod is ""Unstable Platform"": -40%.  Includes: moving cars,
helicopters, crumbling/unsteady standing/kneeling/lying surface

          APPENDIX 1 - ENDURANCE RESEARCH
>From Jim Mochel on 1/5/98:

Ahh. This harkens back to the good old days of game design ! Here, for those
who never had to listen to me on this topic :-), is a quick summary of the
research I did for SH. Muscle fatigue models just as you might expect , with
expenditures of stored energy (stage 1) up to the point where the body
starts trying to bring in other energy reserves (stage 2) , then when those
are exhausted, continued exercise causes damage to the tissue (stage 3).
Stage 1 expenditures are gained back quickly (in hours) while stage 2
expenditures take days to recover from.
Fatigue from aerobic activity is related but not necessarily linked. As a
person starts exercising their breathing deepens to bring in more oxygen for
burning energy. This continues with the increase of activity until the point
where the respiratory system is no longer able to bring in enough oxygen
(the famous oxygen debt). At this point the body starts burning stored
oxygen (in other forms). What differs for many activities is the percentage
of stored versus intake oxygen being used.
Sprinters go into oxygen debt very quickly and experience much less muscular
fatigue for a given event than marathon runners who expend a continuous but
small percentage of stored oxygen throughout the race. Muscular fatigue by
that time is often the main recovery item.

The oxygen pool does increase in size as a result of training but it is not
that elastic. The amount of stored oxygen is always a much smaller amount
than could be desired. Experienced athletes (Cyclists and Runners have been
extensively studied) simply expend less energy per action.

Oxygen debt is recovered very quickly (AKA Second Wind) (scale: minutes) but
you recover less effectively each successive time you blow through that pool
of energy.
Recovery from extended labor appears to be a _relatively_ constant value.
Oxygen debt recovers in minutes, stored muscular energy in days, damage in
weeks... And the variation is not that great between person to person.

True.  I have adjusted the wording to be more accurate.

Not a lot- I have added some emphasis to this in the text to make it more
clear.

While this is true I want to be as loose as possible in allowing secondaries
and tertiaries.  I don't want to start having to police it oo much. I would
just as soon turst people to take reasonable skills and let them stretch a
little.  *shrug*

Good nomenclature.  I have stolen it.  :-)

Ummm.. a good plan and one I flirted with but I finally decided I wanted the
freedom to have some related skills be REALLY related(4/5) and some vaguely
related(1/5).  *shrug*

Because all actions supported by support skills have some benefit attached
to them.  great Blow doubvles damage, lunge covers twice the normal ground
of an attack in less time., called shot lets you hit them where you want to,
etc.  That is why.  AND I think if you are not doing a called shot. haivng a
RANK 10 in called shot with a particualr family of weapons is better than
having a rank 10 in some vaguely related skill.... I think it is worth a
secondary.  :-).

Some support skills ARE rolled against.

Okay-wow!  labeling and nomenclature are so important!  ""To-hit"" refers to
any adjustement of the percentile success roll.    So when I say one cannot
critical ""to-hit"" it means you can't ceritically enhance the percentage
adjustement per rank.

It is a support skill because it adds percentage to the success chance of
another skill- it is a skill that supports another skill.  On the other hand
I can see your point given it acts as a primary in a contest of skills but I
think for now I will keep it as a support skill.

Great - I iwll it is not parallel.  First you use 8 counts(or 8 counts minus
ACT points used) to activate the wizardry as a primary activation roll.
THEN you cast your sorcery.... If you plunge your activation roll to 0 then
you go deep and don't even have to log it- it is activated!

It might be better to define things a bit tighter than you want to run 
them.  That way, when the inevitable questions arise, you can ""give stuff
away"" without sacrificing youroriginal vision.

I disgree, but it's your vision.

I would be interested in hearing others' opinions on the subject.. 


>>I thought support skills weren't rolled against?  Is this a change, or
>>just a leftover?

>Some support skills ARE rolled against.

I would reclassify all of your ""roll against"" skills as non-support 
skills.
They might be 'Activate' or 'Indirect' skills, or even 'General' skills.  
If you set these boundaries and then fuzz them all up with exceptions and
counterexamples, people will get confused.

I want a nice, orderly world, dammit!  (And a system to match...)

>>Not needed.  The skill you are rolling against is not a 'to hit' skill.

Words are very important, particularly if the people reading them haven't
been involved in the system for years.

As I understand it, though, there is currently NO SKILL ROLLED AGAINST TO
INCREASE ANOTHER SKILL'S CHANCE.  They are either 'Activated' to give a 
fixed percent per rank, or give a fixed effect without rolling.

I'll admit this is a tricky mechanic to describe, but you are continually
referring to one skill's result as if it were mergeed with the other 
skill.
Activations (the only case where a support skill is rolled at all) are 
serparate actions from the skill use, as is painfully obvious at 1/5 
second
per count.  The EFFECT of the activation is 3%/rank.  This is the number
that is fixed.  The TO-HIT of the weapon kill is not involved.. that is
a separate skill and a separate roll and can never be affected by crit 
results anyway.

Okay, I'm ranting.  It may seem a small point, but it's important.  
Instead
of people thinking they have a binary on/off roll, they should be thinking
they have a modifier that they can control.  I think that if you state 
that
the 3%/rank is a fixed amount, you will get a lot fewer complaints from
people than if you go around saying ""no crit effects are possible"".  I 
also
think that talking about modifying ""to-hit"" values is just asking for
trouble.

Enough of this, before I start ranting again. <g>

Is Mage-Trance a support skill?  Battle Trance?  These are the other 
'mode'
skills I can think of off the top of my head; they add a percentage to
the use of other skills...

I'm willing to shut up on this point now, actually.  (Especially if I get
the last word...)  You have considered it, and rejected it.  Even if I
don't agree with your reasoning, that is all I can ask.

They are, however, human-powered.  I would think that you could choose 
to use them at lessened effect.  If this is not true, you might want to 
mention it.

For that matter, what about muscle-powered, non-weapon skills?  Can I 
row a boat at reduced effect?  Run worse?  Play the clarinet more softly?
(This is pure Devil's Advocate stuff here, BTW.)



That's it.  I think I'll wait for 6.14 before commenting further.

"Re: BT: 6.13 Summary Post 4 - 01/15/98","Opinion call!

In the text below Myth advocates having all skills that require an active
roll, and that support another skill have their own classification separate
from ""support skills"".  There is some logic to that as it allows us to
reduce the number of exceptions to the rules.

These skills-I was playing around with ""activation"" skills, or ""mode""
skills- would include, I assume,  Kata and Florentine, and what else?

I am willing - what I want to know is:

(1) Do people think it is worth adding another skill type(BOOO! BAD!) for
clarity and ease-of-understanding(YEA!!!! GOOD!)?

(2) Will someone (Myth, Peter, Pook, Jim?) come up with a prototype
description of this skill mode/type/thing....:-)

I do not want to be able to use it because the point is that their DAM is
driven by SPELL POINTS not the human structure.  Therefore it is not like a
muscle powered thing.    You cannot use the DAM buy off with spells.

That was an incorrect assumption.  They definitely apply to Spells and to Ki
Focus.

Well... SPELL POINTS are directly proportional to effect.  The MEN costs of
SPELL POINTS is varied: it depends on Manna Level, source of draw(batteries,
magic items, foci, etc.), success levels put to MEN,  or, if implemented ,
the optional design level rule about END reduction by RANK.

This is still true: a 200-point blast is a 200-point blast.  Manna Level,
and source of power flow have always been variables though in the MEN cost
for those points.  In parts of Marden 1 MEN will buy 3 SPELL POINTS, the
manna level is so high.  People who use batteries have been able to draw out
those points at 5 for 1 or 10 for 1 in some cases!!!!

"RE: BT: MEN and SPELL POINTS","My concern is that if you use the automatic MEND reduction for rank
then a rank 10 person with Power Blast not only gets the 2x effect (for
example) from his critical results that she already gets but she now gets
an additional 2x effect because her conversion of MEND -> SPL is
twice as efficient.  As a rules change this moves the balance to make
high level characters more gross in cases were effect is proportional to
END. This is different from a rank 10 swordsmen who would merely be
able to fight for a longer period under the new rules.

This argument is purely based on an abrupt change in the balance between
character types, not on modeling realism.  I already think that in BT mages
have an edge over non-magic using characters and this exacerbates it.

Without question- good point Jim.  If we do this we would be changing the
Men and END formulas.

The base would remain the same but the contributions from skill and LVF
would be cut in about half.....

Okay, here it is-- ""If Myth ran the world""


1. 'Normal' skills:

        All the regular skills go here; weapons, languages, sorceries, etc.
        Represents learning of a specific action, technique, or lore.
        Rolled at (10*rank)+mods, including assisting skills.
        Rolls may be unopposed (take crit effects), or opposed (compare
SL's).
        Opposed skills subtract opponent's SL's from those rolled for the
skill.
        Normal skills can perform as secondaries and tertiaries.

2. General skills:

        All the 'G:' skills, 'W:' skills, trances, and kata go here.
        Applies to a small, medium, or large group of regular skills.
        Represents general competence in a small body of knowledge.
        Applies a fixed bonus (usually 3%/rank) to skills in the group.
        May have to roll against skill to 'activate' and obtain bonus.
        May have side effects (usually perceptual), bonuses, or penalties.
        Likliehood of side effects increases with size of skill group.
        A skill may only get a bonus from one 'free' (non-activated)
general skill.
        General skills may instead be used for secondary or tertiary
effects.

3. Support skills:

        All the skills that help offset particular penalties go here.
        Represents competence in a particular cross-skill activity.
        Applies a fixed (usually 3%/rank) bonus when performing that
activity.
        Specific support skills may have different effects; see Appendix G.
        Several different support skills may be used at once; all may apply
bonuses.
        The bonus from a support skill may be higher than the penalty for
that activity.
        Support skills may instead be used for secondary or tertiary
effects.


Skills may be assisted by up to two secondary skills, and up to two
tertiary skills.  In addition,
 there may be a number of bonuses due to one or more general skills (only
one 'free')  and 
one or more appropriate support skills.  No skill may assist more than once
in this fashion.
No skill may assist or support itself.


Notes--
General skills seem to be a special no-roll subset of 'mode' skills, or a
very small category
of their own, with huge similarities to the mode skills.  This necessitated
a few other changes
in the verbiage. 


I've also been thinking about the Feint and Parry skills and decided that
(maybe) Alex was right.

Option 1 for them seems to be as support skills for special maneuvers. 
This means it is more
        important what weapon you are using (10%/rank) than what maneuver
you are trying
        with it (3%/rank).  This seems to make logical sense to me, despite
my earlier
        protests.

Option 2 would be as primary skills, with the weapon skill serving as a
secondary.  This sounded
        well and good until I started working through the implications. 
First among those, of
        course, is the fact that feinting or parrying skill would be more
important (10%/rank)
        than skill in the weapon used (3%/rank).  While this might be
arguable, particularly
        without weapons at hand, it does not make logical sense to me,
again despite my
        earlier protests.

So, Alex, you were right and I was wrong.  Sorry for hassling you so much
on the subject.

I assume this was supposed to go to the group.  As far as myself I have somewhat
rethought my positon.

I suppose that if you halve the cost (for a rank 10 person) and then halve
the amount of endurance people have that this retains parity.

Currently Sigmunds END is based as follows:
Statistics	5%
Factors		85%
Skill		10%		(Rank 7)

Based on this I would suggest that you halve only the factor contribution
and not the skill contribution to MEND since this seems to be underrated
in the current system.  The effect of this would be to make the effect of spells
more based upon rank than SCF (probably a good thing).

Also, after thinking about it I realize that my reaction to changing the
MEND:SPL conversion is touchy because I have seen too many 500
point power blasts flying around.  I think that the reason for this is not
that people have thousands of points of endurance but the following:

1.	Between spell batteries and casting in weird places you can
	get a 5:1 MEND:SPL ratio.  This converts an off the cuff
	power blast from doing 25pts of damage to 125pts.  Then
	everyone carries hundred point shields and the world goes
	to pot.

2.	I very rarely hear people distinguishing when they cast a
	100pt blast as to whether it is 100SPL or 100pts of damage.
	Maybe I am  wimp but I only do 1DMG per 3SPL with
	power blast and 1DMG per 2SPL with Earth Attack so this
	makes a big difference.

That was an incorrect assumption.  They definitely apply to Spells and to Ki
Focus.

Well... SPELL POINTS are directly proportional to effect.  The MEN costs of
SPELL POINTS is varied: it depends on Manna Level, source of draw(batteries,
magic items, foci, etc.), success levels put to MEN,  or, if implemented ,
the optional design level rule about END reduction by RANK.

This is still true: a 200-point blast is a 200-point blast.  Manna Level,
and source of power flow have always been variables though in the MEN cost
for those points.  In parts of Marden 1 MEN will buy 3 SPELL POINTS, the
manna level is so high.  People who use batteries have been able to draw out
those points at 5 for 1 or 10 for 1 in some cases!!!!

Actually no, it doesn't retain parity.  It will only retain parity in
specific situations.  Like at rank 10.  People using skills less than rank
10 can do less in the proposed way of doing things than they can now.
People using skills higher than rank 10 can do more.  I'm all increasing
what we can do when skills are higher, but I don't want to decrease what we
can do when skills are lower.

If we do this, I agree.  The contribution of my rank 9 mental endurance
skill is 16% of my total mental endurance.  I see no reason to reduce that
effect.  If we reduce anything it makes more sense to reduce the level
factor effect.

I assume that if we do this then we would say that ""the spell is 60 spl
points from a battery at 10 SPL/end.  The skill was rank 5 which means that
the cost was (60/10) - (60/10)*.05*5 or 4.5 end.  The damage was whatever
damage results from the 60 SPL + the effect from rank 5 and whatever
secondaries.

Okay.  I am with everything ther except for the ""one free(non-activated)
general skill. ""  Do you mean that you can use one non-activated genreal
skill with each primary skill roll and as many activated general skills as
you are applying to the roll?

So, as an example,  you would use W: Conjuration as your ""free"" General, but
then you could enter a Mage Trance, and start the ""FarStorm"" Kata as well
because they are activated General skills.

Did I get the concept right?

That is funny because I was convincing myself the other way!  Since they are
for a particugrouping of skills (BLaded Weapons, or whatever) I was thinking
they shold be Feint as the primary. *laugh*  I could go both ways!

*laugh*  Indeed!


Okay.  I think that is fine.

I think however  that the mode skills might need to be differentiated out.

Proposal:
Mode Skills

Mode Skills are skills which put the character into a particular mode or
Context.  One rolls against them as a primary and they then cause certain
modifications to the chances of the effected skills based on the RANK.

Florentine, Feint, Kata, Ki Focus and Trance are all Mode Skills.

Each MODE skill adjusts the skill(s) it effects differently.    You can have
as many MODS skills as appropriate actions being taken.

*SHRUG*

Thoughts?

I don't think they are that low!  A Material Blast is a 6 point base plus 2
SPELL for every point of DAM.    (I have been thinking of having the base be
ten...)  Therefore a 500 point material blast would do 247 HTK of damage.

One SL of save would cut the damage in half, 2 would cut it in quarter, 3 an
eigth, etc.

I don't see Florentine and Feint as Mode skills.  I do see Wizardry skills
as mode skills.  Alex said to me once ""You call the pattern of the school
to you and can now perceive mana through an Abjuration filter"".

"RE: BT: 6.13 Post 4 - Skills","I agree with Chris about Florentine and Feint not being mode skills.
I think florentine should be a standard support skill.  I think Feint,
like Ki Focus or Parry, is a primary action unto itself.  The more
important reason that I think neither of these are mode skills is that
you are not switching into a mode.  I would normally do feint, attack
not feint, feint and feint.  Also When I do a florentine it is usually for only
one action pair.  Even in my kata WamBamBoom which uses two
florentines they are not the same florentine skill.  The first is a florentine
blade-maneuver and the second is a florentine blade-sorcery.  If these
were modes I would constantly be entering and exiting them in order
to simulate a single action pair.  I think of it more as a modifier skill.

PROPOSED TERMINOLOGY - Trash this at will

Mode skills and modifier skills are almost identical in that you roll to
activate them and if you CRIT your levels can amplify the effect, but:

MODE skills enter a mode wherein the effects of the activation continue
until the mode is exited.  These effects often include perceptual bonuses
and penalties as well as the primary bonus effect of the skill.

Examples of mode skills are: Wizardries, Kata and Trances.

MODIFIER skills apply their effects only to the action immediately
following the modifier.  Modifier skills are much faster to activate on
average than MODE skills.  Modifier skills usually have less side-effects
than mode skills.

Examples of modifier skills are: Ki Focus and Florentine

Feint, I think, should be an action like parry.

A few notes on this:

1.	In Myths definitions I was unclear.  Did he imply that even if a skill
	is activated (ala Wizardries) that SLs could not amplify the bonus?
	If so then that should be adjusted above.

2.	A third category should probably exist for General skills which
	require no activation and therefor have no ""activated"" time span.

3.	I think that the relative speeds of these actions are extremely
	relevant.  I do not really know them but If I had to guess this
	is what I would use:

	Activate Wizardry	8 cts
	Activate Kata		8 cts
	Activate Trance		1 minute

	Ki Focus		8 cts?		
		(I forget since Sigmund has a different version of Ki Focus
		than everyone else.  Is it 16? I think 8 is good)
	Florentine		4cts?
		(I think this should be very short since otherwise doing two
		actions together will take longer than doing them in serial)

	I think in general MODE skills should take longer to activate than
	a MODIFER skill in the same area.

	Just an interesting side diversion.  Stealth.

	Is stealth really a mode skill which you enter and then perform
	movement or some other action?  Is the skill SCF:Stealth (casting
	without being obvious) a mode skill, as well as all the other
	conceivable stealths?  It seems somewhat different from other
modes and somewhat the same.  The difference is that the primary
benefit of the mode is not a bonus to actions but the side-effect.
It is the same because MODE skills are already designed to model
side-effects.

I don't see Florentine and Feint as Mode skills.  I do see Wizardry skills
as mode skills.  Alex said to me once ""You call the pattern of the school
to you and can now perceive mana through an Abjuration filter"".

I've been a bit out of the loop- reading but too busy to reply- I
thought we had settled Feint as a contest of skills . . . I wouldn't
call Feint a mode, its just an action . . . although I CAN see doing a
series of feints to build some wicked mods. . . Also, I would consider
it to be a support skill, not a primary, although I suppose it could be
used as a primary if it out ranked the weapon being feinted with.


On the whole END cost thing-- I thought that the cost reductions were
going to be an optional thing. If END values are reduced, it moves it
from being optional to being required.

Ah.  *That's* where all this brouhaha came from.  I was reading the
reponses and thinking ""A feint mode?  Was I on drugs?!?""  Um, nothing
personal, Alex.

So fold out the general skills from the ""General"" group I proposed, call
them General skills, and call the rest of them ""Mode"" skills.

Sounds good to me.

Now about your selection...

Feint is a normal skill.  It is not activated, but rolls directly against
an opponent.  Whether it is a primary or secondary, it is a normal skill.

Ki Focus is like a set-up skill.  It does not endure past the initial
action (does it?) and seems like a normal skill to me.

Note-- most of a character's skills should be 'normal'.  That 10*rank thing
is your base skill mechanic.  Use it as often as possible.

Kata and Trance skills seem like fine mode skills, as do the W: skills.

Florentine I am not familiar with.  Does it meet the criteria for a mode
skill?  Do you roll to activate it?  Does it stay up for a duration?  I'll
admit I was thinking more of the 'have an entire fight with two weapons'
style of Florentine, rather than Pookie's 'duck in an out of Florentine
several times during a single kata' style.  Is one of those a 'typical'
use?

Well- it sort of is.  I think FLorentine is mor eof a mode-looking skill
than a normal support skill.

Other opinions?

Well, I was thinking about all this in the car the other day (waiting for 
the
inside of my windshield to defrost), and was wondering if Sigmund should 
be
using something other than a florentine skill for his ward-breaking kata.

Would some sort of double-weapon strike support skill be more 
appropriate?  To
differentiate it from Florentine Mode, it should probably be more 
specific, 
maybe even specifying exact weapon (or weapon/spell) combinations. 

Just a thought.

"RE: BT: 6.13 Post 4 - Skills","Well, actually the skills that I use are very specific and perhaps I have
named them incorrectly.  The two skills which I use are:

Use a sword while manuevering (this is actually draw a sword while
accelerating and I may not even need a skill for this, do I?)

Use a sword while casting a sorcery.  This skill involves doing a sword
strike while casting a powerblast through the sword in which the start
of the cast happens during the sword swing (it is a sorcery so does not
require hand waving, etc.)

Are these really candidates for florentine or am I misusing the skill?

"RE: BT: 6.13 Post 4 - Skills","Jack replied back to me that he considers sorcery/sword to be a florentine
and running/sword to be something else.  I think this is very workable
and would make perfect sense for the kata as I am using it.  The question
is:

	If maneuver(accelerate)/sword(draw) is not a florentine then what
	is it?  It does seem a drastically simpler set of actions to combine.
	Is it not a florentine because maneuvers in general do not need to
	be florentined or is it not a florentine because accelerate is a special
	action (as distinct from a maneuver-sword combo like dodge-attack
	or forward roll-draw sword).

Zen State

Thanks,
Zen State is getting to a complete lack of thought and will.  I use it as   
a reset button for my soul.  When reality starts shifting to much or I   
can't get a grip on the Key, I perform a soft reboot by getting to a Zen   
state and starting over.  The key has much more power than I can normally   
handle, so it is either get a grip on my will, or blow up a small city.

"Re: Experience Points","Ron asked how to do eeps.  Here is a quickie  discussion and example:

Formula for Target Number(TN)

TN = RANK*10 - XPM - LVF/10

XPM = the Experience Point Modifier secondary stat
LVF = the level factor of the skill being eeped in.

This formula gives you your target number (TN).

If you roll equal to or higher than your TN you receive +.1 to your RANK.
(I.e. if you had RANK 3.2 you would now have 3.3; if you had RANK 2 you
would now have RANK 2.1)

If you roll less than your TN you get no penalties and can add +.01 to your
rank.  HOWEVER- any hundredths additions DISAPPEAR the instant you
successfully make a roll.  I.e. you could fail 8 times and be at 2.18, but
then you make it and you go to 2.20 NOT 2.28.  Clear?

For every 40 points that you beat your TN by you can add another +.1 to your
rank.

Here is an example:

Bob has a 4.6 in the skill ""Hide"".  His XPM is 2, and his Agility
Factor(AGF) is 22.    He is putting four rolls in ""Hide""

His TN = 4.6*10 - 2 - 22/10 = 46 - 2 - 2.2 = 46 - 4.2 = 42 (round to nearest
integer for target number).

Roll 1: 96  -> This beats 42 by 54.  It is therefore worth +.2
The target number now goes up 2 to 43 because Bob's RANK is NOW 4.8.

Roll 2: 21 -> Bob fails.  It is worth +.01.
The TN is still 43.  Bob's RANK is now 4.81

Roll 3: 44 -> Bob just makes it.  It is worth +.1.
The TN is now 44.  Bob's RANK is now 4.90.

Roll 4: 187! -> This beats 44 by 143!  That is worth +.4!!!!
The TN is now 48.  Bob's RANK is now 5.3 (His AGF went up 1 point as well
but it is too small a change to effect the TN)

So in four rolls Bob went from 4.6 to 5.3.  An unlikely example but you get
the idea!:-)

"BT: Illusion","

>Just taking a quick gaming break.

Yep.  I am sending this to Mochel, Chris, Lara and Jack because it is stuff
they would know and would be of interest to them I think.

>You know I think that Illusion that I had in Baccus' place was really
>cool.  That is much better than the cheesy things that I had imagined
>Illusions to be.

Yes- illusions are extremely cool.  However- most are CHEESY!  Because to
make an illusion like the one you had at Bachuss' takes a suite of skills
and high ranks in illusion as well as lore skills in dozens of appropriate
areas.

>I am curious what you think the kind of skills an
>Illusionist would need were.  Here's my thoughts:
>
>To duplicate that illusion (obviously a very nice one):

An unbelievably nice one- Dionysius has so many ""macros"" supporting him in
the Fields that it is ridiculous.

>A change self/illusory form spell

Yep.  It is two spells:
""Change features"" and ""Change form"" They are both required.

Change Form changes the external shape and general attributes of your form.
It also handles basic interface between your physical actions and the shell
actions.

Change Features adds detail to the form- it adds facial features of a
particular type, hair color.  It does not have any interface capabilities-
it onlky adds a layer of specific controlled attributes.

Both of these are VERY difficult spells.  That is why you see so few
illusionists-  besides showman (moving pictures, walls of color, etc. )
They are truly macros of more fundamental spells which are also difficult.
These fundamental spells all deal with the perceptual realm(illusions all
deal with the perceptions)  Ther eare illusions based on light magic and
enchantment but those are not ""technically"" illusions.

SENSE: Tactile
SENSE: Audible
SENSE: Visual
SENSE: Olfactory (sic?)
SENSE: Magical
SENSE: Divinatory (ULTRA-difficult)
SENSE: Elemental

There are also sub-spells to each of these that:
(1) cause the illusion to react to extrenal stimuli consistant with the
thing being ""illused"".
     Method: Interactive

(2)feed the wielder perceptual frameworks consistant with the illusion.
    Method: Sensory Link


I think you can begin to see the complexity of the illusion school and why
so few people practice it....

>Do I need a separate skill to perceive through the senses of my illusion?
> (e.g. a Div that simulates the senses at their points)
Yes- that would be ""Method: Sensory Link"" of whatever sense you were wanting
to use.

>Do I need a separate skill to handle my illusions physical interactions?
> (e.g. a TK that simulates force?)
Yes- that would be SENSE: TACTILE, METHOD:INTERACTIVE

>My feeling of Illusions in your world is that these last two are
incorporated
>since an illusion is more of a convince others/convince reality of
something
>rather than a hologram with sounds and tactile responses.

Exactly- illusions are a perceptual magic- not an elemental magic!!!!  You
could use TK, elemental magics, shields, etc to re-inforce an illusion and
that would improve the illusion but the illusion itself is perceptual.

>Other skills which would be useful if I wanted to use a change self
>style illusion to infiltrate places:
>
>Read Surface Thoughts (so I would always know the passwords/
> what people wanted to hear)
>Some sort of speak/comprehend your language spell

Absolutley.  Good illusionists are usually also enchanters....

>At the extreme end I might want a spell which gave me the basic
>skill set of the thing I was trying to pose as.  In the short term I
>think I can just get away with my huge set of generalist skills.

Ummm.. most can't do that.  You can get a spell- like ""Comprehend Languages""
that creates a filter you can use that interfaces gbetween you and your
actions but it is hard.  The Comprehend Languages that people blithely throw
around are VERY VERY pre-made intensely-engineered spells that draw on
millenium of work.  WHat they do is tap the sentient  super-conscience and
draw the skills out of the over-ego of the sentients around you.  *giggle*

>BTW:  Did you get an e-mail yesterday from me when I was at home?

Yep -will respond...

As far as Perception:  in btgen.htm you need to take ""+SKL"" out of PER, MPR.
LEAVE it in MAP because it refers to sorceries- oh maybe not.  What a pain

Improved Perception Explanation
Modified Support Skill model


A. Improved Perception Explanation

NOTE:  Thanks to Jim and Chris for pointing out the flaws in the doc.

The secondary stat PER, MPR, and MAP all current have skill*3 in some format
attached to the secondary stat formulas.  They are disappearing.
So if I say what is your PER- I want the raw secondary stat!(Which is to say
the current formula minus the SKL portion at the end.)
So these are the formulas:

*** (begin excerpt- in btgen.htm)

PER = AUR + DSC + SKF/2 + KIF/2 + VHF/2 + PLF*2
Perception. Basis for physical perception of all kinds.

MPR = AUR + DSC + INF/2 + CTF/2 + TCF/2 + MLF*2
Mental Perception. Basis for mental perception of all kinds.

MAP = (AUR + DSC)/4 + SCF/2 + CTF/2 + DVF/2 + MLF*2
Magic Aptitude. Basis for sorceries, magical perceptions. Acts as intuition
in non-magical games.

***(end excerpt)

This then makes the write up in the system rules ACCURATE and more
comprehensible.  Here is the write up: (Chris- take note: some changes
included)

***(begin excerpt- in btstats.htm)

PERCEPTION

The basic perception stats are the secondary stats PER, MPR, and MAP.

PER(Perception) applies to physical perceptions, such as combat perception,
targeting perception, small-scale perception, movement perception or any
other perception skill that involved the five physical senses. Awareness is
the skill applied to general physical perceptions.

MPER (Mental Perception) applies to mental perceptions, such as distinguish
pattern, find reference, scan text, scan view or any other perception skill
that involves internal space. Read Pattern is the skill applied to general
mental perceptions.

MAP (Magical Aptitude) is used as a base for magical perceptions.  Sorcery
Perception(SCF PERCEPTION) is the base for this.

I will discuss perception using the physical perceptions as an example.
However MPR and MAP (when used as a perception) operate the same way.

AWARENESS(also applies to Read Pattern and SCF Perception)
Awareness is used when you are generally aware but looking for nothing in
particular. An awareness roll takes 8 counts.  If you are aware and you roll
a general perception roll (PER) you get your secondary stat plus three times
your RANK in Awareness plus two tertiaries and a general as a tertiary, or
your Awareness skill as a full Primary, whichever is higher.   That is:

SKILL_PER:
RANK[in Awareness]*10 + KIF + RANK[ in 2 secondaries]*3 + RANK[in 2
tertiaries] + RANK[ in general]*3

OR STAT_PER:
PER + RANK[in Awareness]*3 + RANK[in 2 tertiaries] + RANK[in general]*1

The tertiaries on the stat-based-formula are probably going to be the same
skills that act as secondaries for the skill-based-formula.  Also, most
people will not have a general for perception but it is included for
completeness.

SPECIFIC PERCEPTIONS
Specific perceptions (combat, targeting, sorcery, internal, small-scale,
etc.) are narrower in focus.   They act exactly as awareness does but only
for that area of perception and the appropriate skill replaces ""Awareness"",
and the appropriate level factor replaces KIF.  Magical perception (SCF) and
Divine Perception (DVF) utilize MAP as their default perception. INF
perception (INF), Craft Perception (SKF), Artistic Perception (CTF), and
Technology Perception(TCF) utilize MPR as their default.

When you activate a specific perception, your STAT_PER for those events
doubles.  Activating a perception, as this is called, drops all other
perceptions to unaware(-1 SL). To activate a specific perception you must
spend 8 counts (or less if you use ACTION points), after which your STAT_PER
is doubled for that type of perception for (DRIVE + RANK {in that specific
perception}) counts- after which you must reactivate it. The act of making a
perception roll in that specific perception is enough to activate it if you
declare it so.

Passive perception rolls are the fastest and least focussed perceptions. You
may make passive perception rolls at 0 time at any reaction. They can also
happen at a GMs discretion if the situation violently changes during a PCs
action and the PC would likely notice the change. A passive perception roll
is done at -1 Success Level.

*Unconscious(heavy sleep, unconscious, dead): -4 Success Levels on Aware
*Fully Unaware(light sleep, totally surprised): -2 Success Levels on Aware
*Unaware perceptions are: -1 Success Level on Aware perception
*Aware perception (being intentionally aware) is: STAT_PER or SKILL_PER
*Activated specific perception is: STAT_PER*2 or SKILL_PER

REMINDER: When a specific perception is activated all others become unaware.

NOTE:  SKILL_PER does NOT double because of activated perceptions- only
stat_per.  You can still choose whichever is highest.

EXAMPLE: COMBAT PERCEPTION
Most of the perceptions follow the same general rules. We will use Combat
Perception as an example- take your cues from it.

Combat Perceptions
The skill Combat Perception is more than raw perception- it is half a lore
skill- knowing how people move... knowing weapons, etc.

It takes 8 counts to make a combat perception. It lasts for [DRV + (RANK)]
counts. During that time you may make 0-count passive perception rolls as a
full primary at every reaction. Or you can make perception rolls on specific
events or conditions at 8 counts and add +1 Success Level.

If you have not taken the time to activate your perception a passive
perception roll is allowed at each reaction for SL -1.

Combat Perception Table
Success Level   RESULT
SL  -1       Beats you, you dope!
SL  0        Know that a strike is occurring,
                 know +/- 60% when it is going to strike
SL  1        +/- 30% timing of hit; OR high/low/middle
                strike location; OR hit or miss
SL   2       +/- 20% timing of hit; OR general location
                (left arm/head/chest, etc.);
SL   3        +/-10% timing of hit; OR specific location;
                OR if it is going to crit/crit miss or not.
SL    4      Two from SL 3 results

 On timing of hit, the percentages are applied to the action time. For a SL
1 (+/- 30%) versus a ten count action, you know the timing within +/-3
counts. For a 5 count action, +/-2 counts.

The player chooses how to apply the success levels. Instead of picking one
from the level that the roll indicates, the player may drop a level and pick
two, drop two levels and pick three, etc. So a SL 3 can allow a player to
know the SL 1 info on all three types of info (location, timing, and
efficacy of the blow).


Effects of Timing on Perception Rolls:

Time modifies perception rolls, on the idea that the farther an action has
progressed, the easier it is to perceive. Characters get the most efficient
time- the bonus is always evaluated from the last count of the perception
roll. If it is a passive perception it is evaluated from the count before
the passive perception.


Timing of perception Modification to perception roll

1 count before action starts -50
count before action:-4 SLs
1st half of an action: -2 SLs
3rd 1/4 of action: +0
final 1/4 of action: + 1 SLs

EFFECTS OF PERCEPTION ON DEFENSIVE ACTIONS
If you parry, block, or defend a specific part of your body/mind/whatever
you get, as a positive modifier, the modifier you would have taken if you
had made a called shot there.

A parry or block must occur in the last half of the WSD of the weapon being
parried. In other words a long sword, a ten count weapon, must be parried
within the last five counts to be effective. Uneven weapons round the parry
window time up. If the parry/block goes off before or after that window it
is not effective.

SURPRISE:
Surprise results from a critical failure on a discernment roll; or two
failures in a row on the same action; or a GM call that the person wasn't
even expecting that kind of event (i.e. a sentry not expecting trouble might
be surprised on a single failure when grabbed from behind...).

*END PERCEPTION CONVERSATION*

B. Modified Support Skill Model:

I have been struggling with how support skills interact with each other.
Thus I have looked at how they operate and I have decided to make some
changes to clarify how they operate.

Up until now people have been operating with different rules, people have
been allowed to pick between using the support skill as a secondary or using
it as a primary with the effected skill as a secondary.  Here is my
thinking:
(THIS IS A RAW THOUGHT.  INPUT WELCOME AND I AM NOT COMMITTED TO THIS):

There are primary support skills and secondary support skills.   Some
current ""support skills"" will become maneuvers.

Primary support skills are rolled as a primary skill with the skill they are
supporting acting as one of their secondaries.

Secondary support skills are additional secondaries(besides the two normally
alllowed) to the skill being supported. If the person is NOT using the
option they support they count as one of the two allowed secondaries.

Maneuvers can act as secondaries to go towards nulling out the penalties the
maneuver causes to any action done simultaneous with the maneuver.  You must
pay florentine penalties when doing the maneuver simultaneous with an
action.  (DON'T PANIC: remember maneuver-physical florentine is only -20!)

KEY:
SUPP= RANK in SUPPort skill; EFF= RANK in EFFected skill; SEC= RANK in a
secondary skill; TERT= RANK in a tertiary skill; GEN= RANK in a General
skill; LVF= appropriate level factor

PRIMARY SUPPORT SKILLS:
> > SUPP*10 + EFF*3 +SEC*3 +2 TERTs + GEN*3 + LVF + MODS
Parry/Block, Feint, Disarm, Bash, Set-Up(requires no roll though)

SECONDARY SUPPORT SKILLS:
> > EFF*10 + SUPP*3 + 2 SEC*3 + 2 TERTs +GEN*3 + LVF + MODS
Called Shot(including Nerve Strikes/Knockout, Location, etc.), Great Blow,
Quick Strike, Instant Attack, Florentine,

MANEUVERS:
> > (standard primary calculation) HOWEVER adds
> > SUPP*3 to EFF if EFF is taking minuses from
> > the action the support skill is effecting.
Lunge, Combat Maneuvers, Armor Wearing

*** END SUPPORT SKILL CONVERSATION

Let me know what you all think.

I AM NOT SPEAKING TO YOUR CHARACTERS NOW

Some of you must be wondering what this strange project that I have asked you all to participate in.  It has finally come time for me to knock off my arch-nemisis Rismaeon.  For those of you who do not know him directly Rismaeon is one of the five who are associated with the Ward of Nuryev and he has been a bug up my ass since the moment he reincarnated himself (which was about a year and a half ago).  Currently he has himself locked away in the ward and he refuses to leave for any pretext whatsoever becuase he is afraid that the minute he leaves one of the large number of people who he has ruthlessly screwed over will lock the door and not let him back in.  Well, he's right.  Not only has Rismaeon personally backstabbed me in the past, but he is currently attempting to re-program part of my brain (he is attempting to take over sole control of the ward which happens to involve tearing out parts of my brain and attempting to rewrite them) and would rather turn all Fortu into mindless slaves.  I can only assume that this monomaniacal quest for complete domination of the ward is based on a deep seated desire to rule all of reality.  Of course I could be misinterpretting his gesture.  He might really be a philanthopist who feels that he could solve the worlds ills if only he had enough power.  In fact,  I can't claim to be much of an angel myself.

Anyway.  I am highly motivated to act now since recent events have set Rismaeon on a path which could lead to him finding out my secret identity.  If he were to find that I was Nuryev (one of the others of the five and somebody who would have a damned good reason to be pissed at him) I think he would probably try to kill me right off the bat.  So I am trying to come up with a more than half-baked plan to take him out before he takes me out.

Becuase he is such a high level mage/reality mucker I fear that if multiple people started knowing about this plan that he would get wind of it.  I am clear that if anyone were to start talking to deities about this the gig would be up.  For that reason I am trying to be vague at the momemt, enroll people in a dangerous task based purely on my winning personality and the fact that I will owe you one big time and then fill the characters in on details at the last minute.  Hopefully at that point he will not have enough time to react.

Target Profile

Rismaeon is a high level mage of a variety of specializations.  He also is a master of discipline magic/wild magic whatever you want to call it.  He is even more powerful since he is entrenched in his home court and probably has traps up the wazoo.  

Part of this danger will be his access to the linking ward which would allow him to do all sorts of nasties like propell people into other realities/the void.  I am going to attempt to have the ward actively resist his commands and also suppress any preprogrammed responses which might go off.  This should probably work since the wards mind is my mind.  This may be difficult however since (a) this is the part of my brain which he has been trying to re-program and (b) some of it may be like trying to repress your blink reflex.

Another source of danger is that (at a minimum) I think he will have two Fortu with him (a gaurdian model and an information model named Katran).  I am currently checking through Alex to see if there are any more.

There is also a chance that Deitic magic items will not work in the control room (or any items that involve an external link or gate).  I am also looking into this.

The Group

The people who I have contacted to help me in this are as follows:

Morphus
Mordenaith
Erithmaeon
Peter
Kalarina
Dora
Kor'Keth
D'Jan

Becuase of Morphus's special relation to Rismaeon (he is bound by an oath not to harm him) I am hoping that he can take care of distracting the other two of the five (Falstaff and Logos) so that they are not around at the time we try to take Rismaeon out.

There is more to the plan, but I am also open to suggestions.

       Understanding that this is player information I will give you

Kilsorana has no problems helping...

If Dora knew all this she would opt not to help you... Personal grudges and
this thing called the ward are ambiguous enough to her not to risk getting
hammer destroyed or thrown into the void, besides her personal affront to
being put into different time streams etc....  so, depending on your

Does that help your planning strategy?

realities/the void.  I am going to attempt to have the ward actively resist
his commands and also suppress any preprogrammed responses which might go
off.  This should probably work since the wards mind is my mind.  This may
be difficult however since (a) this is the part of my brain which he has
been trying to re-program and (b) some of it may be like trying to repress
your blink reflex.
Another source of danger is that (at a minimum) I think he will have two
Fortu with him (a gaurdian model and an information model named Katran).  I
am currently checking through Alex to see if there are any more.
There is also a chance that Deitic magic items will not work in the control
room (or any items that involve an external link or gate).  I am also
looking into this.
The Group
The people who I have contacted to help me in this are as follows:
Morphus
Mordenaith
Erithmaeon
Peter
Kalarina
Dora
Kor'Keth
D'Jan
Becuase of Morphus's special relation to Rismaeon (he is bound by an oath
not to harm him) I am hoping that he can take care of distracting the other
two of the five (Falstaff and Logos) so that they are not around at the
time we try to take Rismaeon out.
There is more to the plan, but I am also open to suggestions.

This is a good opportunity for me to give peope notice about changes in Mordanith's 
day to day behaviour. Mordanith will routinely talk to all of you about the strategic/tactical 
decision trees that go into planning the campaign against the Lich. Everything from potential alliances 
and delivered deaths all the way over to communications and supply logistics. 

In many cases he will cut off conversations as he discovers that one path or another touches 
upon the balance but it will be an eargerly pursued ongoing conversation. As a result, I think that most people 
will realize that any major undertakings that involve Mordanith have to further the campaign in some way.

Okay, it's later.  Alex, you seem to be changing perceptions from the old 
dichotomous system (physical vs. mental/magical) into more of a 
trichotomy [with apologies to the English language] of physical vs. 
intellectual vs. mystical.

I'm not against this.  In fact, it might even be a good idea.  In the 
final reckoning, it is a philosophical question and outside the scope of 
what I might reasonably complain about.  (Do not expect such petty 
considerations to stop me in the future; this is a one-time exemption.)

What I -am- against is the implementation, from a mechanics standpoint.  
MAP, as I originally learned it, was a quick-and-dirty estimate of 
general sorcerous ability, letting those with the stats have a small 
chance of minor spell-effects (incoluding detection-magics) and those 
with the skills do a lot more outside their rigidly-defined spells.  In 
the paragraphs above, you have declared it as a primary perception, 
without reformulating it at all.  To make matters worse, it still seems 
to retain its other function as well.

I think you would be better served by making a new base perception stat 
(SPER, for Spiritual PERception, perhaps), and running it much closer to 
the previous models (AUR + DSC, anyone?), and letting MAP continue solely 
in its old role.

There is also the question of whether the three-fold view is to be 
expanded to cover the rest of the primary and secondary stats as well.  I 
have no objection (again, it's a philosophical choice), but would like to 
see such a change properly thought through, rather than adopted on the 
fly.

Given your table here, it might be better to explain in the paragraph 
before that ""it is harder to perceive actions before they start, or while 
they are in their early phases"" than what you have... your table holds 
mostly negative mods, rather than the positive ones implied by your text.

Hm.  Confusing.

Some counterthoughts, to do with as you will.  I'm working wioth combat 
skills here, since they seem to be the primary case.  Extrapolation into 
other cases is allowable, even recommended.


Some support skills are really altered attack forms.  Parry and Feint, 
for example, are things you do instead of attacking with your weapon, 
because you think it will help you tactically.  No chance of florentine 
penalties (unless you do several of them at once), because they are 
normal skill uses.  Note that they all affect where the blow lands and/or 
how much it hurts.

Samples: Parry, Feint, Block, Lunge, Great Blow, Roundhouse, others as 
you think of them.

Call Them: Morganatic Skills (just kidding!)  Style skills.

Suggestion: Use weapon skill, with mods for the action and 3%/rank for 
the support skill.
Alternative: Use support skill (with mods for the action) with weapon as 
a secondary.


Other support skills are really separate actions. Combat Maneuver, 
Acrobatics for special attacks, a second weapon skill, or Plane Shift for 
interdimensional Judo are all unrelated (skill-wise) to the use of a 
weapon or attack.  No chance of avoiding florentine penalties here, since 
that's what they're intended for.

Call Them: nothing special.  They're just other skills you happen to be 
using.

Suggestion: Roll support skill as primary, apply florentine mods.


Then there are the other ones.  Skills designed to be used with other 
skills.  Florentince, for instance, or quickstrike.  Their primary effect 
isn't on the attack, but on the mods applying to the attack. Admittedly, 
this is a tough distinction, but it allows, say, the Florentine skill to 
be used without accruing additional Florentine mods.  (That way lies 
madness.)  These are really system-affecting skills, so I would strive to 
keep them free from Florentine penalties.

Call Them: I dunno.  Support Skills.  Mode Skills.  Phred.

Suggestion: Roll support skill as primary, apply SL's to current action 
mods.

"Quick BT Question","I've been updating E-man's sheet, and noticed that the BT rules
allow for two Tertiaries on his Magical Defense (with the Magical

Physical Defense has the same structure, and goes so far as to

I am leary about things which automatically give you another skill just
based on the fact that people who learn G:Panda Followed by W:Panda get a
free skill whereas the other way does not (or does it).  On the otherhand is
G:Panda any use once you have W:Panda.  It just seems wierd.

Also - here is the big question - can you cast a spell with only G:Panda.
If so whats the use of W: skills.  If not whats the point of G: wizardries.
I would suggest if you want this feel they should learn ""Panda School Lore""
which they would end up learning anyway and it would give them theoretical
knowledge and enough casting ability for lab use but not the real ability to
create or cast spells.  Actually I amend my early point becuase the point of
having G:Pigpen school of Geomancy is that you can use it as a general on
Sorceries even if you can't cast spells with it. G:Panda might still be of
dubious use.

>(B) Here is a possible package example:

Having never heard of these advantages and in fact possesing no ads or

>""W: Evocation"" will also act as filter skill in that for every 2 RANKS

I like the filter skill and have been assuming this to be true all along.  I
also assume that language and rune set are filters in the same way.  I have
never bothered to take the written version of the casting language for most
languages since I thought it was not relevant to casting (though very useful
if you happen to find a historical book from that cultural source).  Is this
true?

Danger.  No impact rule for high level mages.  You should have to roll under
something like:

    Pattern Matching Skill - (70 - 10*Wizardry Skill)  (look familiar)

Also critical effects on pattern matching skill should mean the wizardry is
damned present but should not add to critical effects for the spells cast or
it will get too gross.

Useless - you should roll under the pattern matching.  If your wizardry is
higher you should still roll under the pattern matching or it is not a
balance factor, just an augmentation.

I assume that once linked to the pattern you can cast any number of spells.
I also assume that then linking to another pattern would be a florentine as
well and any spells you cast once you had two wizardries active would be a
triple florentine.

What the hell is a patterned sorcery.  I assume that these are new as well.
On the one hand they sound much more like what I have always been trying to
model Sigmund after.  Sigmund never wanted to be a wizard in the beginning.
He just wanted to be a sorceror who is not limited to the thirty odd
sorceries on the sheet for all time.  What does a Wizardry give you if it
does not give the SPABS and perceptions.  As far as I can tell the only two
benefits at that point are the presence of a general skill (which could be
G:Fire [see above] as far as I care) and the ability to research new spells.
Now that is where the meat is.  Can a patterner reproduce all of the effects
that a Wizard can through spells?  Can a sorceror research new sorceries?
Is a patterner more like a sorceror or a wizard?  Right now (ooh this is
going to be tough to run) I would say that Fortu with the mage mode HW can
attach to any pattern without problem and all other Fortu (if they can do
magic at all) learn wizardries as normal humans would.

But I am not sure whether I buy into the Patterner thing yet.  I am
waffling.  Might I point out that unless the ""more flexible but not as
robust"" clause becomes clearer that for JimJM and I, being a Patterner would
basically mean business as ussual with a small minus which would go away
after a few runs.

"Re: BT MAGIC: Schools of Wizardry/MAGIC","Just a few questions whose answers would clear up alot about this Wizardry
thing.  The basic idea is that in the human sphere of things 99% of all
Wizards operate in only one school and the remainder have a small number of
schools.

If this is true then:

What kind of Wizard built the net.  It is highly abjurational, has transport
lines (conj) and communication lines (div) as well as other things we don't
know about.  It is obviously has some discipline in it but is it's base
rooted in a wizardry? Is it multi-disciplinary?

What school would the spell heal to pattern belong to (which everyone in
Shifters has to my knowledge except maybe Kilsorana)?

If I wanted to make a conjuration trap would that be a conjuration spell or
an abjuration spell?  Could it be either?  I suppose it could be an illusion
as well if you designed it with the right wording?

Can a warder (abjurationist) make matter shields?

Can you cast a spell from a school if you do not have the W: skill? I assume
not.

Can a geomancer make a divination spell called ""Commune with rocks"" which
lets rocks tell him what they see in far off places?  Can an ecomancer
create Tree-Door (or whatever that D&D spell is which lets you walk into a
tree and walk out of a tree a thousand miles away in a flash)?

Can a diviner ward against divinations?

I have a magic item which contains keys to 13 wizardries.  Why did they make
it if you are never going to find a mage who is tuned to 13 schools.

"Re: Sunday - Please Read",">Pookie has already agreed to upgrade Sigmund Magically as per
>discussions we have been having.

Not to get to excited here.  Pookie is not upgrading Sigmund completely as
per all of the discussions which have been going on since he doesn't even
understand half of them.

What I am doing is the following:
1.    I decided which of three camps I was going to be in:
    a.    Have my character fit the ""does everything with a single Wizardry
(or small number of Wizardries) that has lots of neat special effects"" which
Alex suggests for all human characters.
    b.    Have my character fit the ""do all kinds of magics but treat it as
a generic interface to a veriety of patterns"" which Alex suggests for elven
characters named Mordainith.
    c.    Have my character refuse to participate in any premature changes
until I have more of an idea of what is going on.

I picked (a) becuase I like the idea of giving wizardries a lot more
uniqueness and character.

2.    Having chosen to go with style (a) I looked at my existing W: skills
and converted all of them to G: skills except one which stayed a W:.
Actually this is not true becuase the thing which I ended up with a wizardry
in was a W: I did not have before but I just did a little name changing to
make everything fit.  The concept of Sigmunds interaction with magic is
still essentially unchanged.

3.    I took all of my spells and moved them to my new W:.  If the spell fit
within the new W: that was great otherwise I altered the text of the spell
slightly so it accomplished roughly the same effect but fit within the new
school.

4.    This leaves me with a bunch of G: in my old schools and each old
school has a number of sorceries which I still use associated with it.

What about special abilities?  What is a G:?  How do general skills work?

Beats me and I am not going there.  I am going to continue running with the
old rules and models for magic because I haven't heard anything yet that has
stabilized enough for me to even try to understand it.

What I do have is a character which happens to have only one W: skill
(perfectly legal under the current rules).

He has a bunch of skills called G:Some School of Wizardry which he uses only
as lore skills about how that wizardry works and as a general skill to any
applicable sorceries (not quite precedented under the current rules but
certainly not a stretch).  I have no spells in anything I have a G: in (also
perfectly normal).

Basically I have done a character rearrangement not to comply to the new
rules but to set me up so that when new rules exist I will have zero impact.

I sent this because I did not want people to stress about adopting some new
wierd set of rules which I doubt anybody feels terribly comfortable with
yet.

"Re: BT MAGIC: Wizardry ","Quick lobotomize him before he comes up with another idea!  No, that was
harsh and unfair.  But seriously, I am not in favor of that.  I do not think
that the subschools are sufficient the way they stand.  Namely, abjuration
as a whole I think has sufficient variation to make a playable mage who was
only a wizard of this.  For this reason I think that from a play perspective
W:Abjuration should exist as at least the cultural and behavior set which
defines a full Wizardry.

What I mean by that is I don't think characters would be just a Warder
alone.  And for that reason I don't think there would be a school of Warding
alone.  I think whenever you had a Warding school (a specific set of special
effects and practices) it would generally be accompanied by Binding and
Shaping schools with similar styles and history.  People might specialize in
one but they would tend to learn a little of each to round themselves out
and thus their flavor would generally merge.  For this reason I think there
should be a single skill which covers the ""style"" of these abjurations.

Another completely seperate reason is that I don't think that the speciality
sub schools are necessarily spanning subsets of their parent school.  Power
Attack, is it a shaping, a binding or a warding?  How about detect power or
identify power?

"Who sigmund is","Having gone through all of the character chaos surrounding the switch to a new Wizardry model and having generally been pleased with the results of that I thought it would be a good time for Sigmund to step back and see if he could clearly and succinctly state what he is as a character (obviously a grand master of the run on sentance).
 
Here we go...
 
SIGMUND IS A WARRIOR
Sigmund is a MASTER of the longsword (although becuase of his size it looks more like he is wielding a Claymore).  He is also the worlds only MultiWeapon MASTER (having the worlds only MultiWeapon) as well as a mean hand-to-hand fighter.  His style is a generalist fighting style having alot of experience with a wide variety of weapons, including a number of missile weapons, and using his body a lot in combat.  He integrates his fighting very well with Sorcery and DreamWorkings as well as his Fortu abilities.  He has no cultural fighting style but rather displays a mish-mash of curltural styles.  He is a master of small unit tactics and a decent strategic level planner.  He is hard and when dropped from a height tends to leave a crater.

SIGMUND IS A DREAM LORD (Dream Master/Dream Warrior/Herald/Yogi?)
Sigmund manipulates reality at a very internal level.  He is a GRAND MASTER dream walker as well as having a GRAND MASTER level of reality enforcement.  I envision that the same effect which surrounds Lenore also surrounds Sigmund (reality is just much more real in his presence).  At this point he sees and interacts with reality walls as if they were any other terrain feature (slight exageration).  He also has a fundamental control of his own form (shifting Fortu modes, healing himself and altering his size) by internally directed will.  Whether it is player based or character based Sigmund has never spoken as if he had a traditional view of reality.  I envision that at some point Sigmund will be seen calmly walking out of a chaos storm with earth forming just as his foot steps on it and disentigrating moments after he moves on (perhaps I should wait a few more levels before trying that stunt).
 
SIGMUND IS A FORTU
Not exactly the news of the century, but it is a major part of his character.  Sigmund is not human, he reacts differently, he doesn't need to breathe, he can alter his time rate, fractional plane attunement and other things that normal humans might not even realize exist.  As far as Fortu go he is very attune with his abilities and is about to reach MASTER level at being a Fortu with extreme competency in all of the various Fortu SPABS (Also see THE FORTU below).  As far as what a traditional Fortu is, that's a long discussion but lets lop it down into three general areas:  Fortu are fundamentally really tough creatures which can survive in most environments and are really smart and fun to talk to.  Fortu are creatures that have a lot of abilities useful for assisting people (mages, priests, generals, sages,..).  Fortu are creatures that have a lot of abilities useful for killing people (speed, stealth, transverse,...).  In each of these areas, in addition to his Fortu ability skills, Sigmund has reams of relevant more normal skills (Magic Save Skill, Channel Power, G:Stealth for example).  Also, becuase of his ability to shift between Fortu modes (via Dream above), Sigmund every Fortu's Fortu and has skills across the breadth of Fortu experience.

SIGMUND IS A SORCEROR
This is not one of the major apects of Sigmunds character but it certainly is prevalent enough to not ignore.  Sigmund routinely casts sorceries, mostly to support his warrior/assasin roles.  I have not precluded him from casting any sorcery he feels like but in the past he has cast mostly Earth, Matter, Power and Will Sorceries.  He also has some sorceries integrated into some of his Kata making them even more closely related to his warrior aspect.  Sigmund also has some ""Divine Sorceries"" which he uses on occasion but I think I should rework these with Alex since I do not think there is any such thing as divine sorceries.  These are Earth and Souls Divine Sorceries and are used to support his Earth Sorceries and Divine Fortu abilities respectively.  Sigmund is good at all of these but not MASTER level at any and doesn't really ever intend to be.
 
SIGMUND IS A WIZARD OF W:LINES
This is new and still under construction but cleanly encapsulates a lot of Sigmunds prior interactions with magic under one conventient heading.  Sigmund is tuned to the fundamental concepts of lines and dimensions.  He is (almost) a MASTER at manipulating lines of any type.  Targetting lines, DIV lines, lines of directed will etc. as well as things that are expressed along axes such as position.  Based on the current design of this wizardry (Kua-Tao in origin) he can often be seen blinking from place to place around his lab (I remember the bad guy in Golden Child for some reason) as well as demonstrating other odd behaviors (which I will describe in a sperate post).  This is the school through which he does most of his magic.  Unless it is an off the cuff sorcery in combat or a massive Discipline ritual  sigmund is probably using this school (he probably integrates it into all of his disciplines as well - after all never deny a part of yourself when altering reality).  He uses this school a lot for working with Fortu, working with the ward, creating wards and constructs in general, etc.
 
SIGMUND WILL SOMEDAY BE A WIZARD OF W:ALTERATION
This is consistent with his Kua-Toa training and is an open ended plot element but at the moment he has really tiny ranks in Alteration so you won't catch him doing it much.  Besides, I would like to develop some depth around the other skill areas I have first.

SIGMUND IS A DISCIPLANARIAN
Most people in shape shifters are.  What can I say?  I just get this itchy need to stick my fingers into the fine mesh of the very fabric of reality and wiggle them around a little.  Step one, acknowledge the nature of your problem.  Of the discipline related skills I have one third of them are perceptions (in support of the Sigmund is a Dream Lord role), one third of them are Net or Fortu related (in support of the Sigmund is a Programmer role) and the remaining third are the random results of various discipline centric runs.  Mostly Sigmunds style with regard s to disciplines is ritual based except for perceptions and one spell (for lacing wizardries during combat).
 
SIGMUND IS ""THE FORTU""
Not to be megalomaniacal but I consider Sigmund to be the archetypal Fortu both in the sense of his skill set and in his representation as an embodiment of the Fortu racial essence.  As such I imagine that Sigmund has a special rapport with all Fortu that extends to a mystical level (not just that we are on speaking terms).  I also view Sigmund as holding the space for the Fortus ability to do anything and be anything they choose.  I also view Sigmund as the gaurdian of the Fortu race (against being reprogrammed UNWILLINGLY by non-Fortus).  I do not view Sigmund as the protector of all Fortu in a physical sense (if you stick your nose in a big bad battle field you risk getting it singed).  This is an area where Sigmund is currently weak but he is growing rapidly.
 
SIGMUND IS A REALITY PROGRAMMER 
I consider Sigmund to be one of the top ten reality programmers in the world (the megalomania strikes again).  Of course this is only a delusion in my own head.  I speak specifically of that category of reality manipulator which builds discipline based Wards rather than massive will applications or deitic wards.  Do I know what I am talking about?  No.  All right let me try again.  I like Nets.  The net is my home. I like wards.  I like to program the linking ward of Nuryev.  I also like to inhabit other wards (not necessarily the Liche's or the one in the city caves of Salaam - OK maybe like is the wrong word).  If you want to build a ward or a network Sigmund is the person to talk to.  Sigmund is both a MASTER ward programmer and a MASTER net programmer.  At the moment these are the people that I know are better than me: Rhismaeon, Logos and I suspect Ariock and The Liche.  People like Correllan and Dau-Pen are definately better reality manipulators than me but I am not sure if they are better programmers.  I doubt it makes a difference.  Hey, you know what,  the megalomania gets stronger when you approach the areas of the old Nuryev personality.  How intertesting. 
 
SIGMUND IS AN EXPERT ON THEORETICAL REALITY
This may be just another aspect of the above but Sigmund has lore skills coming out of his butt on every subject ranging from theoretical discipline mechanics to elemental physics to theology to planar theory.  He is an avid studier of the mechanics of reality both from the current context and from a wide variety of other viewpoints.  He is also always willing to have a theoretical discussion.
 
SIGMUND IS NURYEV
This is a secret.  Only seven people (in the game) know this so far (Kheldar, Ariock and five Fortu), but it is a plot element and I suspect it will become more of one as time progresses.  BTW:  Nuryev is all of the things that Sigmund is except he is not as much of a Sorceror and he is not a Fortu or ""THE FORTU""  although he is more of a Wizard and much more of a programmer.  He is also a really nice guy.

"Re: Ward of Nuryev and the Heartstone Isolation","First of all, our T-1 is down and so I only got Myths reply so far (as I
suspect is the case for Jim).  Sorry if we have appeared conspicously
silent.

Was there a conspiracy amongst the gods?  I was not aware of any at the time
that I proposed the isolation but I would not be in the least bit suprised.
I never trust anyone or anything.  Was divine influence partially
responsible for the machine getting in such a FUBAR'd state, you bet.  It
was too rapid escalation of the power levels and a series of major divine
reality alterations which was making it likely that the machine would get
blown.  We knew that.  Do the gods hate the machine and would they do
anything in their power to kill it?  You bet, we knew that too.  I would not
trust any of the gods for a second (not even the big A) with the ward.

So what does that mean?  I don't view it as the gods deluded us or conspired
with one of us to pull off the ritual.  To consider that I would have to ask
the question who amongst us was influenced by the gods and the person who
would have had to be influenced was me.  Now it is possible that I was
""altered"" to the point where I felt I had to do it since the only
information Pookie was going on was that Alex said Sigmund recognized that
it was necessary to do.  I think a much more appropriate way to look at it
is that we were forced into a corner.  The gods created a situation (with no
subtelty whatsoever) where the ward and machine were damaging themselves.
They exploited the fact the Rhismaeon is a shit head and destabilizing
things to try and ram himself into the core and take control.  We could have
done nothing and watched the machine destabilize (they win, we lose) or
backed Rhismaeon (they lose, we lose) or do what we did (they win
temporarily, we win in the long run I hope).

I don't know about you but it seemed obvious to me that every dipshit deity
under the sun was going to be creating their own consensus symbol as soon as
the big one went out of scope and I hated this (one mighty ugly way to shake
up the food chain).  I have no idea what is going on that started when we
experienced the Valhalla thing but I did expect that there would be some
major power gambits.

This, by the way, was why I inserted myself into the isolation ward when we
closed it off.  I knew that some mighty major forces were going to oppose us
re-opening the symbol and I wanted to have an edge.  To be honest I was
concerned that Odin might be one of the biggest forces trying to exile the
old symbol.  This is why my top priority of the moment has been the
following:

(Player to Player - Sigmund never tells Kheldar his full plan to kill
Rhismaeon)
1.    Cack Rhismaeon or get him out of the Ward so he will stop killing off
Big Brother.
2.    Reconnect the ward to the Symbol of Consensus and bring it back into
public view.

The only thing which is stopping me from doing all of this NOW is that I am
a little intimidated by the thought of taking on a major discipline mage in
a highly fragile control room right in the middle of Big Brothers brain pan.
I am really worried about symbol growth as well as Rhismaeons progress
moment by moment.

In summary I don't feel like we have been delude or are involved in a
conspiracy.  I feel more like we are in a big chess game and we have just
sacrificed a pawn to avoid checkmate in three.

BTW:  What information do you have on other symbols?  Do you know what is
going on around the bridge?

"Bardic Tales Interlude, I","The wind howled outside the crystal windows.  The figure leaning on the
banister leaned forward and peered into the swirling orange dust as if
the answers he sought could be found there.  

His flame-red hair contrasted sharply with the deep night, blacker than
black purple of his floor length robe.  His hood was pulled down low and
his shawl draped loosely about his shoulders.  He sighed and stroked the
runes and colored threads in the shawl as he watched a sandy red plateau
appear in the distance, and then be covered again by the orange
storm....

""My lord?"" The acolyte- without shawl, and in the green robe of his
station- trembled as the President of the Wizard's Council turned his
eyes upon her.  There was no expression on his white face as it waited
for her message.  

""Yes, my... daughter?""  

She looked up at him and froze as she became lost in his large,
forest-green eyes.  

""I... I... um... one of the Inner Council is here to see you.  I... I
know you said you didn't want to be disturbed but it is one of the
Seniors...""

He sighed and rubbed the bridge of his nose.  ""Let him in.""  

She bobbed her head and disappeared back into the octagonal doorway.  
He heard the Senior's footsteps echoing off the black marble walls
before he saw him.  

""Mr. President.""

""Senior Councilor.""

""I am sorry to disturb your meditations, my lord, but...""  There was a
click as the great oaken door at the end of the hallway closed.

""... are you mad?""

The president grinned, ""I have to say- you are not the first to ask, my
old friend....."" His smile did not reach his eyes and it faded as he
turned back to the swirl outside the quiet corridor.  

""The Allanndi are twisting the world... did you know this would happen? 
Did you plan it?  ""

He jerked his black hood back and his large brown eyes flashed in a face
made ruddy by the dusky light from the windows.  His hair- brown, long,
and thin- was short on top- a soldier's cut- and his beard was thin and
well-trimmed.  His shawl was threaded with orange, blue and gold giving
him the status of Archmage and Mastery in the arts of Conjuring,
Divination and Warding.  However, he looked like
a soldier, with the weathered, thin, wary face of someone who spent a
lot of time outdoors, and the lean muscle of someone more at home on a
mountain trail than in a library.  

The hall was filled only with the sound of the Archmage's breathing. 
The President finally drew a breath.

""No Tomas,  I didn't plan it, "" he laughed bitterly, ""I  opposed it. ""

""And do you know what condition my ward is in?  She is practically
dead!  She will need to be re-integrated...""

""DON'T BLAME ME FOR FORSETTI'S VAULTED AMBITION!""

Silence filled the hall once again but for the whisper and whine of the
winds against the windows of the corridor.  

""I would never hurt her- you know that,"" he whispered.

""Unless you had to.  Unless you had to.  ""

""The others use the Allandi far to swiftly,"" the President continued,
""the world unravels around them and they wonder why.  All three of King
Karollin's new Allandi have grown too fast- and putting two of them
together in the same group."" He shook his head.  

""Two?  There are five of them in that grouping!  And you put together
six of them to destroy Oleanth!  You are not without guilt in this
manner.  ""

""Guilt?  Please don't become a child with me!  You know our goal!  We
needed the Allandi!  The prophecies were all working against us.""

""I know.  I know.  What are we going to do?  Wotan walks the Earth on
both sides of the bridge!  The Ward  is sapped of fundamental energies
at a time when it is under direct attack- and bone head's armies are
swarming out of the hole they have been hiding in for so long... ""  

The President shrugged and pointed outside.  ""Look where we are Tomas-
in an artificial world built to hide from the Real World.  We enslave
others with our power as much as the Lich or King Karollin.""

""Us?  No Krell- YOU.  I do what I do to serve humanity and to protect my
wards.""

""Oh... really?  Serve humanity?  Have you checked in with your smallest
ward recently?  She is embarked on a mission that could spell the end of
human kind.  ""

""She will never succeed- you know he isn't-""

Krell slammed his fist into the wall, ""NEITHER IS WOTAN!  She is an
Allandi!  She wields one of the original conversations of her racial
nexus.  Do you think there is no risk?   On top of it Forsetti's blade
is following her.  ""

""What?  But he was killed...""

""No."" Krell smiled again, ""He is a lot harder to kill than many
expected.  He will join them.  ""

""But the prophecy- we cannot let them...""

""DAMN PROPHECY!  DAMN IT TO OBLIVION!   The two blades are wielded by
Allandi my good Tomas!  If anyone can warp the prophecy she will....""

They both smiled at the thought.  Tomas paused and then asked, ""What
about Morphus?  The reality shift wasn't pervasive enough.  Too many
people know.  Will he need to be protected?""

""No- he is surrounded by two of King Karollin's, one of Dof-Sifrin's,
and one of Dau-Penn's.   They are strong enough.  He also has the
support of Forsetti's little grey cabal of Wizard-Warriors.""

""All right. I need to get back to follow what her Grace is doing.  Any
more luck on finding out what the Old One is really up to? ""

""No- he is still beyond my reach.  Besides, he is currently at the edge
of the outbreak.  I am avoiding that whole area since Forsetti and Kay
are both there.""

Tomas turned and then paused and looked back at the still figure.  ""Do
they know?""  

Krell smiled.  ""No one else knows, Tomas.  Only the four of us.   They
think the big secret is that I and Loki share a corporeal form. ""

""If they find out....""

""Then no corner in all the worlds will be safe for me my good friend. 
You aren't preparing to betray me, are you?  ""

""No.... my lord.""  Tomas bowed very low, and then flipped his hood back
up.  As he turned his cloak and hood became blue, pinned by twin short
swords and his clothes became a rustic brown travel robe with pants
underneath and boots in the Maeran style.    His shawl disappeared and
then he faded in swirl of orange mist that matched the maelstrom
outside. 

The President stared at the spot where his servant had been moments
before.  He stopped breathing and stepped out of the artificial shape he
had been wearing.  Swifter than thought he was gone.

Only the hiss of sand from the outside filled the hall a half an hour
later when the acolyte stuck her head in to check on the President.  She
sighed with relief and then hurried back to report to her area.

Hours later the wall by the door shimmered and a small figure emerged
from the wall.  Graylar looked around and then shouldered his multi-bow,
and disappeared down the corridor softly whistling to himself...

Excuse me?  

As if Krell and Morphus have had anything close to an amicable
relationship.  (Uh, that is: with the caveat of ""consciously"" and ""in the
current reality stream"" and ""within the last few hundred years"").  Boy, I'm

I believe that the magicians

given the number of ""high level magus"" currently ran by ""scenario

Well, I have always found it to be more staisfying to play hard rather
than soft- though I have found that often the soft touch will bring the
matter to a conclusion as a strong frontal movement.

Alas!  I lower my lance to your suggestion, milady!  Consider me
withdrawn- I hope I have not pulled out of the field too late to keep
the lady's graces.  I will resheath my lance and rest till I have the
strength to lift it again....

"Spell Batteries and different types of spells.","Ahem.  

Brace yourselves.  In my spare time I have been methodically going
through all the assumptions and properties of the spell system.  

Her ecome ssome:  

I originally assumed that ""Incatantion: Summon Air"" and Sorcery: Summon
Air""  Were different skills.    I still operate under this assumption. 

However... what is their relationship?  What if they are the same except
that ""Incantation:Summon Air"" is longer and much more effective but they
do exactly the same thing.  If you vae rank 12 in the incantation can
you do the sorcery at RANK 12 automatically?  

If you have RANk 12 in the working can you add a few spins and a couple
of bows and dust thrown in the air and have a Ritual?  

What if- I am not sure I am proposing this this- rather I am inquiring-
ther eis one skill and it can be done as a:
Sorcery, Wiorking, Ritual, Rite or Incantation.  Maybe we could do it as
familiarity.... If you are familair with it as a working you are -30
with a sorcery or RItual, -60 with a rite and -90 with an incantioation
version.  

It would simplify mages character sheets and would boost a skill's
overal play effectiveness....  WHat do you htink? 

SPELL BATTERIES

Brace yourselves.  I am thinking of getting rid of them.  Now before any
one kills me (likely candidate: Mordanith who has HIGH ranks in SPell
Battery and uses them constantly) I was thinking of transforming the
concept rather than getting RID of it per say.  

I was thnking about WILL and MANNA.  Manna is directed will.  I never
liked storing power points because there are no ""POWER POINTS"" ther eis
only applied will and we measure using a metric called power points.

I was thinking of converting spell batteries into ""Angreal""s like in
Robert Jordan's wheel of time"" series.  They are WILL ENHANCERS.  

Example: 
So if you are a mage- and you have an angreal that Mordanith constructed
it's will-to-ouput ratio might be say, 5:1 (this would be outstanding-
practically an artifact class Angreal) Therefore every point of will you
drew in would give you 5 spell-points for your cast.  So if your 
SCF is 100 and you therefore draw 20 points a count, with that you would
draw 100 points a count.  To use the ANgreal would require a short
sorcery(5 counts, 5 MEN) to activate it.  It would then be ""operational""
for the duration of its use + caster's DRV in counts before it had to be
re-activated.  If you used it before the DRV counts waiting period was
up it would reset to zero so you oculsd use one on-going ly for hours as
long as you had MEN.  They might have a limitation of 1000 points of use
a day or you risk breaking it or something like that(after 800 points of
use ANgreal starts overheating, etc.)  

I like the look-n-feel of this much better than chunks of will strapped
to your belt... what do you all think?

"Re: Spell Batteries and different types of spells.","     (I am certainly not an expert in this system, so please correct any 
     errors of fact below.)  However, 
     
     Regarding spell batteries:
     
     I assume that there are things like 'ritual artifacts' - by that I 
     mean:  A mage can learn a spell, and then 'store' or bind the spell to 
     an artifact.  For instance, a 'Summon Air' spell might be stored in a 
     feather artifact.  
     
     It seems to me that prohibiting spell batteries, per se, won't achieve 
     the desired effect of doing away with them:  Mages will just get 
     around it by infusing ritual artifacts with 'general power' or 
     'enhancing spells' or the like.  
     
     Moreover, I wonder what, if anything, is actually different about 
     'angreal's:  Will they have some physical form (as do spell batteries) 
     that one might strap to one's belt?  Or are they just listed as a 
     'skill' on the player's sheet?  If they are indeed just listed on the 
     sheet, why not treat spell batteries that way as well?   
     
     It looks like you are merely substituting one nomenclature for 
     another, here.  Of course, you may change the name and the particular 
     mechanic of the effect, but I don't think that you have addressed the 
     underlying design motivation.

Air""  Were different skills.    I still operate under this assumption.

Okay.


>> However... what is their relationship?  What if they are the same except
that ""Incantation:Summon Air"" is longer and much more effective but they
do exactly the same thing.  If you vae rank 12 in the incantation can
you do the sorcery at RANK 12 automatically?

We had talked among this with the various categories of working (I -hate-
those names!) and you had been thinking of making them 'related' skills.  I
was assuming a -20% (1/5) penalty for each step away from the base skill.  I
don't know how this affects the 'realism' of the magic system, but it is a
simple mechanic, and easily applied during play (when mages often have to
improvise.)


>> If you have RANk 12 in the working can you add a few spins and a couple
of bows and dust thrown in the air and have a Ritual?

If they are the right spins and the right dust, why not?  Aren't you just
invoking more of the underlying pattern of the effect you want?  I'd limit
such improvisations, perhaps by requiring a Wizardry or Ritual Design roll,
but it seems to make sense that such could happen.

First reaction: Bleah.

Second reaction: I am not overly fond of the idea.  We are tracking
familiarities, not skills, but the paperwork looks roughly the same.  It
will reduce diversity, lessen opportunities for skill-pyramids (secondaries
and tertiaries), and .. um... make me redo my character sheet again. (Hey; I
needed three, I got three.)

So you're saying spell points are like 'gravity' or 'time'... things we can
measure, but not store or quantify.  Okay.  (Philosophically, at least.)


>> I was thinking of converting spell batteries into ""Angreal""s like in

Haven't read it.  I get the impression that they are like lenses, at least
somewhat.  But if you need to change things to match your vision, change
them.


As a Binder, I am more concerned with the implications of this than with the
actual batteries.  (Oddly enough, I seldom utilize them.)

Is the 'Bind Power' sorcery going away?  I was under the impression that
that was one of the base sorceries underlying spell batteries.  (The
controlled release of this power being the other major part... no good
having 'em blow up partway through your ritual.)  If it is possible to store
power, and later get it back, I can't really see the technique falling into
disfavor among the power-loving (and -using) mage crowd.

Of course, it might be tricky, or not cost-effective for most uses.  It
might even be illegal (given a potentially disastrous failure rate once all
the Abjurationists were killed off.)  But if it is possible, it will be done
(at least occasionally) and if it is not possible, more than one Binder is
going to be dismayed.


>> I like the look-n-feel of this much better than chunks of will strapped
to your belt... what do you all think?

This enhancer thing sounds like that thing that Khalid already has.  It is a
will-magic item.  I do not think it fills the same niche, thematically.
Sorry.

"Re: Spell Batteries and different types of spells.","ABOUT INCANTATIONS VS. SORCERY

I must be ahead of my time.  That is the way I thought it always has worked.
I assumed you researched something like Warding ritual (always picking a
default mode) but if you spent longer it would be a Warding Rite (maybe
taking some unfamiliarity mods) and if you wizzed through it it would be a
working (I always assumed that shortening was way harder than lengthening).

I suppose I did draw the line in that I thought Sorceries were completely
different beasts than the Working/Ritual/Rite/Incantation spectrum and I
think this is still true.  After all I can cast a sorcery without a W: but I
can't cast a working.  Also W/R/R/I crowd all require VSMP components
(Verbal/Somatic/Material/Prep) and sorceries do not.  I would argue that it
is good that they are different.  I would not want to see Sorceries becoming
as sophisticated  as Wizardries or Wizardries as fast as Sorceries.

ABOUT SPELL BATTERIES

I think you also have exactly what you are describing in you world.  They
are called Kua-Toa power enhancers.  My take on this has always been that
spell batteries are a specialized conversation of power enhancers which are
made more accessable to human minds by adopting a lot of ""limitations"" which
may not make perfect metaphysical sense.  It is the same issue regarding
time travel or wizardries.  Certain people buy into the limited view of
things because it is part of a cultural paradigm and that makes it safer for
their brains to handle.  Now as for spell batteries I think that part of the
abjurational pattern (pardon me while I design on the fly in somebody else's
sandbox) is the fundamental conversation that mana is a manipulable object.
Of course you and I know that it is not but we also know that physical limbs
are merely a convenient representation for the relative ability we have to
manipulate each other.  It's not true but it is useful for an abjurationist
to pretend that mana is an object.  Once you buy into that it seems only
natural to make a collection device.  Are you actually making an enhancer?
Sure.  You are using a built in macro designed by the people who put
together the abjuration pattern that makes casting this complex will working
easier as long as it has this built in safe gaurd of having use-limiting
characteristics.  Why would somebody build a limited version like that?
Well becuase building Kua-Toa power enhancers is REALLY tough and so this
version is much more accessable to most people.

Now here comes the interesting point.  Why does limiting the spell battery
by introducing the spends and recharges conversation make them easier to
build.  I think the answer is that just making them limited is exactly what
makes them easier to build.  On a discipline level one could ignore the
mechanics of what is going on and just say Kua-Toa power enhancers are
powerful because they are very rare and therefor having one makes you
exceptional.  Spell batteries are less powerful but still very useful
BECUASE they are more common and therefor it is less of a differentiator to
have one.  The level we are talking at here is the level in which everything
is reduced to the fundamental level of who, in a conflict, is more able to
affect the other.  Any items or skills or abilities we have are merely
justifications as to why I am more able to affect you or you are more able
to affect me.  There actual properties are irrelevant except in the way we
by into them.

So back to the issue of spell batteries, I say the reason spell batteries
work the way they do is because some brilliant mage decided that this
limitation fit beautifully with the school of abjuration and served his
purpose.  The purpose that he needed was to find design for a limited
version of the power enhancer pattern because by it's limitation it would be
easier to cast (the universe/mass-consiousness would resist the creation of
these objects less).

Sigmund enjoys having discussions on a theoretical discpline level.

Also, as an element of character I just like the BATTERY design pattern
where you fill it and then it get's used up.  I think the game would be very
different if everyone where running around with always on power enhancers.
Perhaps there are other limitations out there.  A slightly closer to the
Kua-Toa original version that you described was the current limited
amplifier.  Put more than a certain load through it and it blows (possibly
taking you with it).

That is true.  However that effect is acceptable for me form a story
standpoint- I want 
feathers that summon air.  All that stored will is directed towards a
pre-determined 
intention.  It is what we call a ""spell trigger"" or a ""magic item""

""Spell triggers"" have a single execution of a spell stored in them and
when released by a simple ritual or sorcery they unleash the spell.  
Triggers require that one point of the casters power(the stat POW not
MEN) be bound into them to maintain them over time or they will fade in
a matter of hours or days. 

""Magic items"" have a spell effect cast on them/generate a spell effect
that is relatively permanant. 
They require the caster to bind their or others POW in the item to
maintain the magic.

That is fine though- that works for me.  Though you can't infuse an
artifact with ""general power""- it must be specifically directed.

They are ABSOLUTLEY not skills.  They are objects that a character has. 
Indeed they are magic items!
The differecne would be that they would have limitations that a spell
battery does not and they would fit my world model better.  (You need
context-generating being stuff (POW) to manage directed will and there
aren't ""particles"" called ""power points"" that you can store in a box
called a ""spell battery"".)

I think I have - does what I have said above make it more clear?

Design motivations:

(1) Have the ""spell battery"" nitch make more sense to me in the
meta-physics of magic in my world.
	(a) change them from POWER storage devices to POWER draw enhancers.
	(b) makes the magic alittle more personal and less machanistic
	(c) similar to (2) gives more a look-n-feel of a Wizards as I 
            imagine them.  A ""battery"" is a very 20th century concept
IMO.

(2) Put some limitations on spell batteries that I think will make
gaming magic more interesting and challenging.  

Thanks ROn!

"RE: Spell Batteries and different types of spells.","I also am not an expert on the magic mechanics of the system, but I am
seriously into playability and balance, so here is my 4 cents.

What is the exact difference between a spell trigger and a spell battery
anyway?  Isn't a spell battery just a more general form of a spell trigger?
I generally don't like the concepts of spell batteries, period.  To me it is
more of a balance thing that and actual reason for disliking them.  I just
find them unbalancing as far as play goes.  It is not he will the better
skills or creativity who wins, its he with the most spell batteries.
Anyway, I digress, back to my original thought.

If you go with Alex's concept of 'Angreals' where the battery is more like
an enhancer then spell triggers and batteries are the same thing.  The more
confined the enhancement the more powerful it is.  For example, say Khalid
makes three spell 'triggers' as follows:

1) General will enchancer keyed to himself - This is a very general will
enchancer and is what is considered a battery in the present terms.  It is
keyed to his specific pattern but can be used to enchancer ANY sorcery or
spell up to a certain amount of power.  This item is less structured than
others and so can not enhance that much, say it will output 5 points of
power for even point sent through it.

2) A fire sorcery enchancer - This is a more specific enchancer, much like a
focus, and can be used for any sorcery or spell that uses fire as a base.
The pattern would be keyed to Khalid and to the general pattern for fire.
Because this is a more specific item it has more enhancement properties, say
10 points for every point passed through it.

3) A fire ball spell trigger - This is the most structured of the items and
is an enhancer for one specific pattern.  Because it has only one pattern
associated with it can also be used to shorted the cast time.  It would
still require putting power into it in order to set it off, but may not
necessarily be associated with only one person.  It might have a very high
ratio say 15 to 1.

So there are levels of spell trigger based on the amount of structure they
have.
Level	Effect	Restrictions
1	2-3:1		Can be used by anybody, for anything (General
Battery)
2	2-5:1		Can be used by one person for anything (Individual
battery)
3	3-7:1		Keyed to a general pattern (ie.fire) but usable by
anyone (General focus)
4	5-10:1	Keyed to a specific individual and general pattern
(Individual focus)
5	10-30:1	General Spell trigger (Usable by anyone for a specific
affect)
6	15-40:1	Individual Spell trigger (Usable by specific person for
specific affect)

Obviously, I'm just making up the numbers.

     I assume that there are things like 'ritual artifacts' - by that I

Okay.... hmmm.. see below:

I agree.... maybe have the base sorceries be distinct and have a M:
<spell> which could be done as any of the five styles of a wizardry M:
spell depending on time and familiarity and material asnd your ranks in
W:/R:/L: of that school., etc.

You would have a style you were familiar with and then you could slowly
familiarize yourself with more and more types.

This is my favorite stand at this point....  I heard what you said Myth
but I think there is enough breadth in the secondfdary and tertiary
rules that you should be able to come up with two secondaries and two
tertiaries....

Umm.. somewhat.  Read the ""Wheel of Time"" series Myth- it is really
interesting, IMO.

No!  Because you CAN bind power... it just doesn't last very long and if
it isn't managed by a POW source it gets muddy very quickly.

It is.  I am talking about a relaity-shift that says: ""It isn't
practical to bind power to an object in a safe way that you could carry
around and tap into like a battery"".  Tying spell lines togethe rin a
ritual, putting knots in spell lines, tagging something with power,
settting a ritual space - all that Binding stuf fis still on.  AND the
creation of triggers and magic items is all binding.

My plan.

Well- see above- Binders basically can keep doing what they are doing-
just not make spell batteries - they will make angreals instead (I need
a new name for these!)

No- but this a different story.  Khalids object ahs the capacity to act
a an ""angreal"".
It does more though- it adds relaity mass to what Britt does but that is
a different conversation... :-) 

> It is a

> Sorry.

It does not.  An angreal however would.  

Here is an alternative way to look at this discussion (new
interpretation):  

I am just settling down the rules for spell batteries.  Okay:
* It can only hold (Caster's SCF*2) points, it takes (points held)/100
POW to hold the battery together.
* It costs 5 MEN and 5 counts to open the tap to the battery.  It
remains open for use for (Caster's DRV) cts of inactivity.  AFter that
it has to be opened again. 
* The cost of drawing spell points out of the battery depends on the
efficacy of the cast that created the battery: a typical battery is 1
MEN for each 3 points drawn out of the battery.  A really well-crafted
battery could achieve 1/5 or even 1/6.

Pookie says: 

>Also, as an element of character I just like the BATTERY design pattern
>where you fill it and then it get's used up.  I think the game would be very
>different if everyone where running around with always on power enhancers.

You haven't run the numbers on this I think- this would limit people not
increase 
their power.  Spell batteries are too powerful- this is a limitation. 
The truth is 
filling a spell battery is no big deal if they are re-fillable. 
Angreals would be more 
powerful in the sense that they don't ""run out"" but that limitation of
how many 
points it can process per day(without heating up and then if exceeded
blowing up)
 is, in play, the same as the linmitation of how much power you have
stored in
a spell battery.

"Re: Spell Batteries and different types of spells.","ABOUT SORCERIES VS. INCANTATIONS again

Myth triggered off another thought.  One of the things that I have been
playing with in my design of the W:LINES school for Sigmund is that rather
than the skill type you are using, the difference between a rite and a
ritual is the state you are in.  I linked the ritual state (incantation
state,...) to you degree of attunement to the wizardric pattern and also
linked other side-effects to being in that state.  That way the real key to
casting an incantation would be to use your fireball skill while your
character was in the incantation level of tuning to the Pyromancy pattern
and it would just naturally take longer and produce a fire phoenix the size
of a Mack truck with a range of 20 miles. At the same time, by being in the
incantation state for pyromancy you would probably be on fire or be
transformed into elemental fire (maybe in a ritual state you would only have
your hair on fire and a body temperature of 200 degrees celsius).

"BT Magic: Spell Batteries and different types of spells.","Ok, how about this:

Working, Spell, Ritual, Rite, Incantation are all variations of the same
Wizardry, but you must buy each higher level with a greater quantity of
eeps.  eg. Level 1 Wizardry spell is normal, Level 2 is 2x eeps, Level 3 is
3x eeps, level 4 is 4x eeps, level 5 is 5x eeps.  if you are Rank 5 in a
Ritual and you want to go to rank 5 in a Rite of the same spell you need to
pay 4 * Rank 5 * something.  Maybe that something is the difference between
the cost of buying rank 4 and rank 5 at character creation.  Jim, doesn't
going up in ranks in Spacehybrid work something like that?

The game effect is that not only do you require Rank 10 to do the
Incantation level of Wizardry, you aren't going to have many at that level
because it costs so much.  I'll write down more later once I've given it
some additional thought.

"RE: Spell Batteries and different types of spells.","I like the seperation of magecraft into different aproaches Sorceries vs. 
Incantations vs. Wizardries,  and I am not all all comfortable with lumping 
them all together.  I think the system could work if you used a family 
skill type of modifier but I am lobbying now for a very distant relation, 
20% or 40% tops.  Here (drawing on what I know best) is my rational.

When students learn how to solve an Algebra problem there are three 
different aproaches I try to teach.

The first is an intuitive ""think about it and see if you can figure it out"" 
type of aproach that works best with simple equations i.e. 2x=4.  Lets call 
this S: Problem Solving.

The second is the traditional algebraic skills aproach, in the equation 
above we were all taught to divide both sides by 2 to get the answer.  By 
catagorizing different types of algebraic equations and learning specifc 
aproaches to solving each type ( quadratic as apposed to first degree) a 
student has a good chance of solving equations.  The downside is that it 
takes longer than the intuitive aproach if the problem is easy as in the 
2x=4 example, and does not work if the problem doesn't fit into a catagory 
that is recognised.  This is an I: Problem Solving.

The third and most powerful problem solving technique that math teachers 
teach is the ""guess check and then guess again"" technique.  This will 
always work given enough guesses so it is the most effective, but it is 
very time consuming so I'll call it W: Equation Solving.

If you'll grant me the above analogy, I can assure you that students who 
are good at one type of problem solving are not neccessarily good at 
others.  In fact often the urge to slip into an intuitive approach really 
gets in their way if they try to solve an equation using a different 
strategy.

I think the same would be true of a sorcerer trying to cast a Wizardry 
(there is no such thing as a slight oversight when juggling 800 points of 
power) or the a Wizard who solves the magical equivilent of the equation 
""2x=10,000"" by starting at 1 and trying every number until they get to 
5000.

I agree.... maybe have the base sorceries be distinct and have a M:
<spell> which could be done as any of the five styles of a wizardry M:
spell depending on time and familiarity and material asnd your ranks in
W:/R:/L: of that school., etc.

You would have a style you were familiar with and then you could slowly
familiarize yourself with more and more types.

This is my favorite stand at this point....  I heard what you said Myth
but I think there is enough breadth in the secondfdary and tertiary
rules that you should be able to come up with two secondaries and two
tertiaries....

Umm.. somewhat.  Read the ""Wheel of Time"" series Myth- it is really
interesting, IMO.

Ahhhh yes you would be.  I hadn't thought this path thropugh.. let's

No!  Because you CAN bind power... it just doesn't last very long and if
it isn't managed by a POW source it gets muddy very quickly.

It is.  I am talking about a relaity-shift that says: ""It isn't
practical to bind power to an object in a safe way that you could carry
around and tap into like a battery"".  Tying spell lines togethe rin a
ritual, putting knots in spell lines, tagging something with power,
settting a ritual space - all that Binding stuf fis still on.  AND the
creation of triggers and magic items is all binding.

My plan.

Well- see above- Binders basically can keep doing what they are doing-
just not make spell batteries - they will make angreals instead (I need
a new name for these!)
>

No- but this a different story.  Khalids object ahs the capacity to act
a an ""angreal"".
It does more though- it adds relaity mass to what Britt does but that is
a different conversation... :-)

> It is a

> Sorry.

It does not.  An angreal however would.

Here is an alternative way to look at this discussion (new
interpretation):

I am just settling down the rules for spell batteries.  Okay:
* It can only hold (Caster's SCF*2) points, it takes (points held)/100
POW to hold the battery together.
* It costs 5 MEN and 5 counts to open the tap to the battery.  It
remains open for use for (Caster's DRV) cts of inactivity.  AFter that
it has to be opened again.
* The cost of drawing spell points out of the battery depends on the
efficacy of the cast that created the battery: a typical battery is 1
MEN for each 3 points drawn out of the battery.  A really well-crafted
battery could achieve 1/5 or even 1/6.

Pookie says:

>Also, as an element of character I just like the BATTERY design pattern
>where you fill it and then it get's used up.  I think the game would be 
very
>different if everyone where running around with always on power enhancers.

You haven't run the numbers on this I think- this would limit people not
increase
their power.  Spell batteries are too powerful- this is a limitation.
The truth is
filling a spell battery is no big deal if they are re-fillable.
Angreals would be more
powerful in the sense that they don't ""run out"" but that limitation of
how many
points it can process per day(without heating up and then if exceeded
blowing up)
 is, in play, the same as the linmitation of how much power you have
stored in
a spell battery.

You'll find it at Word Central, Merriam-Webster's brand

**********************************************************

Merriam-Webster's Word of the Day for October 10 is:

epicure   \EP-ih-cure\   (noun)
          : one with sensitive and discriminating tastes especially in
          food and wine

Example sentence:
          Claude was an epicure who thought it was essential for
          everyone to know as much as he did about how to choose the
          right wine to complement any meal.

Did you know?
          Epicurus, a Greek philosopher who lived from 341-270 B.C.,
          believed that the best life was one of simple pleasures in
          which a person lived with a tranquil mind and freedom from
          pain.  When ""epicure"" entered English in the 16th century,
          it referred to someone who followed the philosophy of
          Epicurus.  But over time people came to believe that the
          philosopher actually encouraged his followers to pursue
          material and sensual gratification, so the term was soon
          applied to anyone devoted to materialistic self-indulgence;
          it later came to be used for one who loves good food and
          wine.

"Re: Spell Batteries and different types of spells.","Wow... we seem to have struck system-discussion gold here...


It looks like we have three (there's that number again) discussions going 
on here:

1. Spell batteries vs. spell triggers vs. enhancers (spell and otherwise)

2. Spells vs. sorceries

3. Various categories of spells.


As befits my usual logical approach, I'm going to attack them in random 
order.


SPELLS VS SORCERIES

As I understand it, sorceries are simple magical effects build into our 
concept of Reality.  Anyone with a little bit of magical aptitude can 
learn the whole array of them.  They are simple effects (though, with 
enough power and ingenuity in their use, possibly quite effective).  They 
do not require the caster to be linked to any particular power-pattern 
for their use.

Spells are wizard-designed sub-patterns that are more versatile, more 
complex, and more unnatural (to the current Reality) than sorceries.  
They range in complexity from the simple (a more efficient sorcery, or a 
combination of sorceries) to the complex (arcane and mysterious rituals 
producing quite unique effects).  They take more time than sorceries, 
they require some form of wizardric connection, and they can be quite 
subtle and powerful. 

Sorcery is a paranatural ability.  Spells are a wizardric creation based 
on the patterns they link to.  That, at least is my take on the matter.  





VARIOUS CATEGORIES OF SPELLS

Right now, as I understand it, Alex is calling all the spells 'workings' 
as a class, and breaking them up into 'spells', 'rituals', 'rites', and 
'incantations' (formerly 'invokations').  At the moment, I believe these 
to be separate skills with some nebulous crossover effect, but I could be 
mistaken.

Various people have proposed various changes to the (apparently 
little-liked) current system.  I see little reason to stay out of the 
fray.  Here is what I would like to see:

A change in nomenclature-- call them 'simple spells', 'complex spells', 
'simple rituals', and  'complex rituals'.  I think the names are more 
obvious in their progression, and better reflect what is coing on.  
('Rite', for instance, has religious implications, and 'incantation' does 
not sound like it takes a long time or required anything in the way of 
material components.)

A change in labelling-- list them as 'M1:', 'M2:', 'M3:', and 'M4:'.  
This will leave the progression a little more clear, and sets the ground 
for my next proposal.

An added restriction-- require two ranks of an appropriate Wizardry for 
each step.  Simple Spells (M1:) would need two levels of Wizardry, etc, 
etc, up to Complex Rituals (M4:) needing rank 8 in the Wizardry.  This 
meshes with Alex's declared levels of familiarity (rank 2) and 
mastery-enough-not-to-get-confused-when-learning-other-Wizardries (rank 
8).  Whether this restriction works by fiat (you can't) or by penalty 
(here are the minuses) is left as an excercise for the stu-- er, Master.

A definition of relationship-- let these various categories be related 
skills.  If I have a simple ritual that summons an elemental and binds 
them to my will, and I need to do it at the speed of a complex spell, I 
take -20%.  If I want to do a simple spell as a complex ritual, I would 
take -60%.  Perhaps skills in Ritual Design and/or Spell Design could 
reduce this.  Perhaps they'd be required to do it at all.  

A definition of concept-- all these workings (whatever we call them) are 
limited to wizards.  The easiest reason I can think of for this is that 
they are a partial representation of the power-patterns that wizards are 
linked to.  Unlinked beings don't have access to these patterns (at least 
not on a personal basis) and thus can't use these sub-patterns.  The 
level of working (M1-M4) would then represent the closeness of the 
sub-pattern to the major pattern.  Since these patterns are unnatural to 
Reality, more effort (time, will, elaborate preparation) is required to 
manage a major manifestation than a minor one.  


SPELL BATTERIES, ETC, ETC.

I'd like to add some fuel to the fire here by asking Alex to consider the 
role of 'focus' in all of this mess.  Maybe even 'familiars'.  From what 
you've said, it looks like a look at all the mage-enhancing techniques 
might be in order.

Other than that, I'd like to point out that a spell-trigger to 'store 
power' and 'channel power' should not be that tricky for a good Binder.  
Aside from the restrictions on decay-of-spell and all that, I think they 
are easier for an ordinary wizard to produce than some sort of 
will-enhancing powerstone or a reality-mass-enhancing sandbag.


But that's enough for today.  

                      -Myth, the over-opinionated.

"Re: Spell Batteries and different types of spells.","I am not entirely attached to the ""similarity"" of rites and rituals and I
certainly agree that Sorcery and ""Workings/Rituals/Rite/Incantations"" are
two completely separate beasts.  I think a large part of it is that I
disagree with your analogy.  I think the distinction you make between type 2
and type 3 is not a working vs. ritual kind of distinction but more a
comparison of two completely different styles of spell (and I hope the brute
force kind is rare in magic).

I will attempt to mangle your analogy as follows:

SORCERY
Some students use the intuitive approach (I look at it and see if I can
figure it out).  Of these some react to the form of the equation and some
happen to try the ""obvious"" numbers until they get one that works.  In both
cases they are relying on intuition.

WORKING
Some students look at the equation and attempt to solve it by selecting the
correct formula from a memorized lookup list.  In some sense they are doing
the same thing as the sorcery example except instead of guessing the answer
they are guessing the solution strategy.
e.g.
    Things like ...    x=ny        are solved by...    y=x/n
                            ax^2 +bx +c = 0                 x = (-b +-
qrt( b^2 - 4ac))/2a
(Did I get that right?  It has been a while).

RITUAL/RITE/INCANTATION
The students perform the same actions as above but they recognize and use
intermediate goals (which could lead to blind alleys and retries but we hope
not).  Thus we start with ax^2 + bx +c= 0 and where a,b and c are integers
we first factor out a and if b/a and c/a are still integral we might expand
the factors of b/c and look for patterns, etc.  Same rough actions as above
except that we are doing a much more complex things.  Not only are we
recognizing solutions and strategies but we are recognizing promising
intermediate goals.  While these are different actions I do not think they
use phenominally different skills.  I think in order to get to step C it is
(a) harder and (b) you need to have the basic distinction intermediate goal
as well as a lot more experience under your belt.

Therefor I would say the above off the cuff discussion would indicate that
the following model would apply.

You have a skill in each magical effect you want to produce.
You have a skill in Working, Rite, Ritual and Incantation (or maybe Fire
Working, whatever)
To cast a working you must have rank in the effect and rank in working.
To cast an incantation you must have rank 6 in the effect and rank in
incantation.

Naah, never mind, I don;t like that.  I think the W: skill already has built
in minimums for casting rites, etc.. and that solves the problem just fine.
I don;t think we need extra mechanics.

"Re: BT Magic Spell Batteries and different types of spells.","I apologize for the delay in sending out more information about my
suggestion last week.  The reorganization at work has had me focusing on
work to the exclusion of most everything.  All I can say is that it seemed
to make sense to Alex when we talked about it.  I'll try to get something
more out before to much longer.

"RE: Spell Batteries and different types of spells.","Thought you did a nice job extending my analogy (math was correct too) but 
I'm wondering if you are suffering from the bias that math teachers have 
against Guess and Check.  Computers use modifications of this method to 
solve problems that are too difficult to solve any other way.

To me when the magical effect you want to get is too difficult to produce 
in any conventional way then you need a ritual.  Please note I'm not 
suggesting that casting a ritual is neccessarily mindless repetition until 
the desired effect emerges (although sometimes I think it is); What I'm 
considering is if Sorceries are inherintly different from Workings/Rites 
and other spells, and this distinction creates variation in mages then 
maybe a new distinction would improve it more.  After all we have many 
different types of Warriors.

Not attatched to this idea, so go ahead and rip it if I'm wrong.

P.S.  I was relieved to see you didn't like your suggestion about a skill 
in Effect and a skill in Working or whatever.  I hated it.

May the Bridge of Heimdal cover us all.

On to more pleasant topics...

Are spells and rituals variations on a theme?  Is a ritual really
nothing more than a very long spell?  Despite my earlier
suggestions, I could see this one going either way.

Another suggestion to throw in the pot: define these things by
their components.  A sorcery is a simple action using a
pre-patterned potential-for-unnaturalness built into the world.  A
spell is a wizardly construct using one or more sorcerous effects,
using a Wizardry pattern built into the world-behind-the-world or
a Discipline of some non-standard pattern that hacks the system.
A ritual is a process based on one or more wizardries (and/or
Disciplines) that uses access to several patterns to attain
extraordinary results.

(Hm.  I like it.  If it were my world, I might even implement it,
given the rest of the magical mechanics.  But it's not.)

Thought you did a nice job extending my analogy (math was correct
too) but
I'm wondering if you are suffering from the bias that math
teachers have
against Guess and Check.  Computers use modifications of this
method to
solve problems that are too difficult to solve any other way.

To me when the magical effect you want to get is too difficult to
produce
in any conventional way then you need a ritual.  Please note I'm
not
suggesting that casting a ritual is neccessarily mindless
repetition until
the desired effect emerges (although sometimes I think it is);
What I'm
considering is if Sorceries are inherintly different from
Workings/Rites
and other spells, and this distinction creates variation in mages
then
maybe a new distinction would improve it more.  After all we have
many
different types of Warriors.

Not attatched to this idea, so go ahead and rip it if I'm wrong.

P.S.  I was relieved to see you didn't like your suggestion about
a skill
in Effect and a skill in Working or whatever.  I hated it.

May the Bridge of Heimdal cover us all.

"Re: Spell Batteries and different types of spells.","I do not think you need any rank in the sorcery on which a spell may be
based in order to cast that spell, nor should you need it. All that should
be taken care of by the pattern.

As far as having a skill in pyromantic working it sounds OK to me except for
the following points:

1.   You need too many skills to cast a spell.  You only need one skill to
make a fire sorcery attack and that is fire sorcery attack.  Currently you
need four to do a fire sorcery attack spell and I think that this may be too
many (three would be nicer, but four is OK).  I propose that there is no
skill pyromantic working, but there are skills pyromantic rite, ritual and
incantation.

2.    What is the meaning of these skills?  So far W: is both an enabler
(rank 2 allows workings casting,...) and a general skill, L: and R: are also
enabling filter skills and M: is the primary.  How would a pyromantic ritual
skill fit into this?

I don't find anything broken with the current system and therefor I have
very little incentive to change it (assuming my impression of what the
current system is is correct).

"RE: BT Magic","[Sorry, Jim.  This is a repost for you, and new for everyone
else.]

Oddly enough, this Dorian mage, member of one of the most recent
schools invented, has asked some of those same questions.

According to my understanding, languages gain power as they are
used.  Repeated bringing-to-mind of a concept, together with the
verbalization of a word or phrase, eventually establishes a
connection between the concept and the word.  As time passes and
the process continues, the link grows stronger.  Eventually, the
verbal component is sufficient to invoke the concept.  At this
point, spells can safely be defined in the language.  Less safely
if the speakers were sloppy thinkers, more safely if the speakers
were all dead, and not continuing to modify the language.

(I'd imagine this is all modified by the reality-mass of the
speakers involved. Interestingly, Alex has said that some
languages needed to be abandoned after developing too much
significance.  Imagine ordering groceries and accidentally
triggering a fireball spell...)

The Dorian Weaver school was founded with Ancient Dorian as a
casting language because it had been well-used my
Reality-affecting people, had lots of concepts for using with
magic, and was a dead language, fairly rigidly-defined, at the
time.

Runes, as far as I know, grow from specialized wizard-marks (much
like mathematical symbology).  The Dorian Weaver school uses
Weaver Runes, developed for the school from the more general
Symbian runes in widespread use around the Free States.  Rune sets
are designed for use with magic, and quickly acquire the necessary
significance by being used by wizards for specific magic-charged
purposes, although I'd imagine a few lean years for a new school
as their runes get charged up with Meaning.

(And all this is only true until Alex says otherwise, as usual.)


                        -Myth, for the Dorian in all of us.

"Re: BT Magic","Just out of curiousity,

Can Kilsorana cast a wizardry spell when she is in Dolphin form?  Is it
because of gestures and words she cannot make/pronounce or is there a more
fundamental reason?

Does anyone know of an example of a non-bipedal humanoid using a wizardry?
Do dragons use wizardries in big lizard form?  Do they wave their claws,
sacrifice an elephant or two and mutter in arcane draconic?  Probably not.
I suspect they would not be the kind to use wizardries much and if they did
they would probably cut out all of the materials at least.

What about unicorns?  Naga? I am assuming Kua-Toa have hands rather than
just fins.  What about quetzlcoatl?  Are there any one-armed mages (bizarre
gardneing accidents you know)?  How about non-corporeal wizards?  Demons of

My somewhat skewed take on it is that since the language in most use of the 
longest period of time gets ""polished"" for the purpose of casting and
gains strength for that purpose, them that gets there firstest with the 
mostest gets to become the most common language. It doesn't mean that
you can't cast in another language, it is just that you won't get the high 
bonus
points for using it AND you may have to experiment in order to figure out 
how to cast in another language. Sharing spells will be difficult and so on.
     
The wizardry power patterns are live structures with branches that wither 
and die
as well as others that grow. It is possible that a full view of the 
vestigial
language usage trails left in the power patterns could tell a great deal 
about
who has used them.
     
The casting language requirements are really not hard and fast except that 
the difference in effectiveness could be to expensive.

"BT Magic: Some elaboration. ","Okay- let me explain something: 

First- what Myth said.

My system does not have a SLIGHT bias that OLD might be better than
NEW.  Old IS better than NEW and a LOT better.  I mean a LOT better.

There are a couple of things which the world is dependant on: 

(a) everyone moves through time at relatively the same pace and in the
same direction.

(b) context generating beings are ABSURDLY difficult to create 

(c) the world as the characters know it- the ""Prime""- has a huge
""reality mass"" and ""reality momentum"" that is based on the millions and
millions of context generating beings who live in that point of view and
the fundamentals of it (elemental structure, some of the rules of magic,
DVF behaviour) are created out of the basic forces that created the
world.  These are- for practical purposes- unmalleable on any kind of
large scale.  At best you could create temporary pockets were those
things were not in place.

(d) all the other places in the ""universe"" (the Abyss, Hell, Faerie, the
Outer Planes, the Bridge) are merely mirrors and shadows of the prime. 
They have almost no reality mass compared to the prime.   This is why
the Prime- and its inhabitants are so critical and why everyone is
fighting over it.  It is also why it was such a big deal at the end of
the Second Chaos War when the BiFrost was set to ward it and lock in the
""rules of engagement"" for the Gods.  

(e) Most of the currently known Wizardries are based on Mardr'a
teachings in the 5 th century after the Second Chaos War.  Legend has it
that a mysterious teacher from before the Ward taught her the Rune Sets
and the basic WIzardries which became the Dorian standards.

There are some exceptions coming from the Naakor, from Rhelania and from
Tharuden.

(f) The Law of Patterns and the Law of Symbols causes patterns using
magic to grow in power as they are used more and more znd as cultures
interface with those they start to drift towards whatever the consensus
is.  I.e. a mage in Ven trying to learn Illusion will ""accidently""
develop runes and speakings very similar to Ancient Rhelanian and its
rune set. The extant to which it is not related to that is the extant to
which it is ineffective.  This is importnat to get- THERE ARE NO RIGHT
WAYS TO DO WIZARDRY!  the right ones are the one that have been done the
most and whose patterns have the most reality mass behind them.  AS it
grows in power a language might have to be abandoned as a normal
langauge because it is too powerful- the patterns of its speaking can
cause unpredictable results! :-)  

Given that a new, clever language or a new WIzardry is going to be
barely a hyped up sorcery at best!! AT BEST!  The DOrian Wizardries are
EVERYWHERE because they were institutionalized very effectively by
Mardra and sooon everyone began using them and they became the most
popular and therefore the way it is done.  

Older and more used is always better than younger and less used.  This
is not technologhy where the physical prinicples and lawes are out ther
eand we need to design something that uses them better... unless you
discover a ""purwer"" version of a spell that is more effective at tapping
into the pattern than the opne that everyone now uses because of a typo
that happeend in the 10th century in the copy being made of Bob the
Arch-Mages spell book. 

*PHEW* does that all make sense? :_)

No.  Her wizardries are dependant on physical patterns it would be hard

No - that is the only reason.

Dragons never use Wizardries.

Unicorns are too stupid to use Wizardries, Pegasi are sorcerors
primarily.

Nope.

Yes they had hands- as did the Slaad(most of the time).

Who? :-) :-)

Not a problem.  Some workings require two hands though it depends on the
spell.
It is a question of physical patterns, patterns of expressed language,
and patterns of inscribed language.  Sometimes it includes the prescence
of certain elements, materials, objects or environmental conditions...

> How about non-corporeal wizards? 

If they can generate physical motion, expressed language and inscribed
langauge and have certian elemntal materials and objects - sure. 
Otherwise- NOT.

Don't do wizardry- at least no one has ever heard of such a thing.

"Re: BT Magic: Some elaboration. ","So this post (amongst other things) does clear up one thing I was wondering
about.  I was noticing the predominance of Ancient Dorian throughout a lot
of mage schools and it made me wonder what language Pentaran mages cast
with.  I guess the answer would be Ancient Dorian and this is why.  It isn't
so much a cultural thing lodged in the roots of the place the mage came from
as it is a seperate academic culture which spans all popular cultures (like
the way most european scholars spoke latin and greek, not just the italians
and greeks and their immediate neighbors).  The reason Acient Dorian is the
'lingua franca' of magic has more to do with Madra and her incredibly
effective saleswomanship than any innate property of the language.

Nope.  Her eis the issue we keep bumping against- we are used to
operating in a reality that is fixed and then we use language to
describe it. Therefore someonme with a deep understanding of the world
could invent a new language that was a more powerful interpretation of
the reality.   This is not the case here.  The powe rof the language
comes ONLY ONLY and ONLY from:
AMOUNT of CONSISTANT USE over TIME. If someone invinets a baby language
witht DOO DOO and DADAs but then gets everyone to use it for five
centurioes to cast magic with it will be the most powerful form of
Wizardry in the World. 

Is that clear?

Okay- let me explain something: 
     
First- what Myth said.
     
My system does not have a SLIGHT bias that OLD might be better than 
NEW.  Old IS better than NEW and a LOT better.  I mean a LOT better.
     
There are a couple of things which the world is dependant on: 
     
(a) everyone moves through time at relatively the same pace and in the 
same direction.
     
(b) context generating beings are ABSURDLY difficult to create 
     
(c) the world as the characters know it- the ""Prime""- has a huge 
""reality mass"" and ""reality momentum"" that is based on the millions and 
millions of context generating beings who live in that point of view and 
the fundamentals of it (elemental structure, some of the rules of magic, 
DVF behaviour) are created out of the basic forces that created the 
world.  These are- for practical purposes- unmalleable on any kind of 
large scale.  At best you could create temporary pockets were those 
things were not in place.
     
(d) all the other places in the ""universe"" (the Abyss, Hell, Faerie, the 
Outer Planes, the Bridge) are merely mirrors and shadows of the prime. 
They have almost no reality mass compared to the prime.   This is why 
the Prime- and its inhabitants are so critical and why everyone is 
fighting over it.  It is also why it was such a big deal at the end of 
the Second Chaos War when the BiFrost was set to ward it and lock in the 
""rules of engagement"" for the Gods.  
     
(e) Most of the currently known Wizardries are based on Mardr'a 
teachings in the 5 th century after the Second Chaos War.  Legend has it 
that a mysterious teacher from before the Ward taught her the Rune Sets 
and the basic WIzardries which became the Dorian standards.
     
There are some exceptions coming from the Naakor, from Rhelania and from 
Tharuden.
     
(f) The Law of Patterns and the Law of Symbols causes patterns using 
magic to grow in power as they are used more and more znd as cultures 
interface with those they start to drift towards whatever the consensus 
is.  I.e. a mage in Ven trying to learn Illusion will ""accidently"" 
develop runes and speakings very similar to Ancient Rhelanian and its 
rune set. The extant to which it is not related to that is the extant to 
which it is ineffective.  This is importnat to get- THERE ARE NO RIGHT 
WAYS TO DO WIZARDRY!  the right ones are the one that have been done the 
most and whose patterns have the most reality mass behind them.  AS it 
grows in power a language might have to be abandoned as a normal 
langauge because it is too powerful- the patterns of its speaking can 
cause unpredictable results! :-)  
     
Given that a new, clever language or a new WIzardry is going to be 
barely a hyped up sorcery at best!! AT BEST!  The DOrian Wizardries are 
EVERYWHERE because they were institutionalized very effectively by 
Mardra and sooon everyone began using them and they became the most 
popular and therefore the way it is done.  
     
Older and more used is always better than younger and less used.  This 
is not technologhy where the physical prinicples and lawes are out ther 
eand we need to design something that uses them better... unless you 
discover a ""purwer"" version of a spell that is more effective at tapping 
into the pattern than the opne that everyone now uses because of a typo 
that happeend in the 10th century in the copy being made of Bob the 
Arch-Mages spell book. 
     
*PHEW* does that all make sense? :_)

"Re: BT Magic: Some elaboration. ","Why yes, I completely agree.  In fact one person who might fit into your
'Mule' description would be Madra who clearly upset the apple cart quite a
bit with her new wizardries.  Also an alternative to the subversive sect
which has always been small but threatens to suddenly blossom is the
subversive sect which used to be the big wigs before some %$&#*&$( broad
with moss behind her ears dazzled those stupid humans into thinking they
could cast magic more easily than brain breaking patterns which were in
place at the time and upset the apple cart upon them.  Now wouldn't it be
funny if all of a sudden after centuries of sitting around idley they
decided to reassert their conversation and in fact assert that it had never
been diminished in power.  Why they might even try to convince us that the
patterns which we use now where built on top of the older patterns and thus
by their use feed the older patterns making them stronger.  Yea, thats the
ticket.

"RE: BT MAGIC: Schools of Wizardry/MAGIC","As you might guess from this response, I am only now catching up on these

Because you are never going to find a mage who is tuned to 13 schools.  


Understand?


I don't know anything about the item, but I think that it fits PERFECTLY
with the discussion that we have been having.  This item is the ideal item
for the generalist (by the way, interested in selling it?).  By wearing
that necklace I could learn and cast Wizardry Spells associated with 13
different wizardry patterns - AT THE SAME TIME - without actually keying
(ie. learning W:Something) and without worrying about getting to Rank 8 in
W:X before beginning to learn W:Y.  

Depending on how it was implemented, it might even allow an elf to utilize
human wizardry Spells (and Rituals, Rites, etc) without that messy and
potentially fatal Keying that those humans do.

Having that item would mean that I wouldn't need to make major changes to
Kheldar under the new system.  Let me know if you are interested in selling
the item, either for other items or services.  Assuming, of course, that
I'm even close to being right.  Alex?

I think there is value in sticking to what we have unless there is a reason

He said he would make a general announcement at some point but somehow in his swamp of work and other things I have a feeling it slipped his mind.  Anyway, I just wanted to send the URL out so that I could get some review comments from more people. I have already gotten a number of comments from Myth and Alex.  This is not meant to be an authoritative rewriting of the rules nor is it meant to be the one truth about the origins of wizardries either.  It is just a collection of info which hopefully will help characters roleplay wizards in the new and more differentiated wizardry system.

Anyway, tell me what you think.  The URL is:

"History","Hi Alex,

I am considering starting on a new project (related to and in fact inspired by the Wizardry project).  I would like to write a couple of stories that flesh out the history of the Kua-Tao a little more.  I know this is a potential mine field since they are the oldest culture I know of and therefor lost in the murky depths of too many reality shifts but I think this may actually be an advantage since therefor nothing I say needs to be true or relevant.  What do you think?

If you think YES Jim should write some histories continue.
If you think NO Jim should not write some histories e-mail a reply now.

The premise to the stories that I was going to write were vignettes which set the mood and historical context for different stages of the Sigmund enitities life.  I see these occuring in three sets:
    a.. Random observations of an unnamed Kua-Toa who acts mostly as an observer
    b.. Random observations of Nuryev at the time of the creation of the Tharuden schools/Creation of the Ward/Battle against the Golden One.  This is a little more active and a little less observer oriented.
    c.. Randon observations of Sigmund in the present.  This will be tales of what I have done.
These three sets would involve three world views:
    a.. View One - Some time in the prior cycle involving the Kua-Toa high court and the Kua-Toa-Slaad wars and the discovery of the Dragons.  This would be told from the perspective of a world so different as to be barely recognizable.  The assumption (on my part) would be that there would be some great terminal event (such as a huge battle) that caused an end to this cycle and replaced it with a history already in progress which is the current cycle.
    b.. View Two - Some time in the current cycle which is during the Chaos Wars (according to Jim - I had a little terminology confusion).  This would center around the time that I was active in Tharuden and when the five were building the ward.  My assumption is that for me personally my start of activity in this cycle would immediately follow the end of the last cycle and yet a large amount of history which is different from the history of the last cycle and yet involves the same characters (like Dau-Pen) would already have occured (entry into a history in progress).
    c.. View Three - The present.  I would treat the present as existing within the same cycle as view two in that much of the world involves the same characters and places (although at least one key ocean has moved).  I would not treat view two as a straight historical predecessor to the present since to many reality shifts have intervened.
In general I would treat the three points as seperate islands of localized interest without concentrating two much on how one view came into being based on another view.  It is almost gauranteed that the perception of the past in the later views would conflict with the perception of the present in the earlier views.  I would also always be telling stories from the perspective of the events as I think the 'Sigmund' perspective would have been.

If you think YES Jim should write some histories from these perspectives continue.
If you think Jim should write some histories from some of these perspectives but not others e-mail a reply now.
If you think NO Jim should not write some histories from these perspectives e-mail a reply now.

If you got this far I am psyched.  I have a number of ideas for basic guidelines that will allow me to be creative without defining to much or stepping on other peoples viewpoints.  Some of these include the following things:

The Kua-Toa are an arrogant culture and consider the only other real culture worth interacting with to be the Slaad and then only to kill them.  Still a Kua-Toa would rather talk to a Slaad then one of those animals like humans or dragons (a very powerful and intelligent animal true but just not socially evolved - sniff).  As such there is a huge amount of things which a Kua-Toa historian would just gloss over as unimportant neither defining or precluding a large number of significant historical events.

I see the end of the last cycle as a terminal event that involves a retroactive rewriting of history to create a past involving many of the same actors with completely different events.  As such when Nuryev pops into the world it is no suprise that the Dragons are much more powerful, that humans are starting to populate everywhere and even build cities and that the true denizens of the world are very hard to find (although there mark is very strong in the form of the Golden Empire and the reality structure present).  BTW:  Can you tell that I just finished the Wheel of Time.

I have a ton more ideas but why dont I wait to get your initial feedback.

Hmmm... tricky question that.  The Elves would say 300,000 human years
ago when Corellan came into existence.  (compared to this time frame-
temporality was different then so it is a little of a silly question.  A
year is given for comparative purposes)

Hmmmm... unclear when the transition was from who she was a a ""mortal""
to who she was a a ""Goddess"".  Was not a huge, climactic event- it was a
gradual shift over time.  BALL PARK: 1200 years ago.

The elves would say there are none or few..  The Chaos Wars are labeled
such after the event- they are labels for transition periods caused by
diffractive fighting amongst the powers that are.  

The one consistent clue is the divination sees a giant blank wall
approaching.  This doesn't MEAN there is a Chaos War - only that there
is a conflict of a size that it could be one.  The upcoming Lich event
meets this criterion.

Here is a big scale time line as I see it: (for this Epoch)

Epoch 1 - Elemental
Epoch 2 - Insects - first Sorceries
Epoch 3- Amphiboids- first organized life - first Wizardries
Epoch 4- Dragons- Lizards
Epoch 5- (our Epoch)

(Years are approximate- that is why they are so even! :-)  Also it is
centric to people and events that you know and care about!  So it is
biased.  )

Year 0
First Chaos War- Hell, Abyss formed (re-formed??); Faerie survives
though vastly diminished!

Old races almost entirely wiped out; Lizardmen and Dragons crippled and
enfeebled go into recuperation; Dau-Penn and Kisereth banished...little
animals spread, breed and form.  ""Balance "" established? 

Year 500  
First Dwarves, Ogres, Wolves

Year 2500
First Humans, Gnomes, Giants

Year 4000
First Dwarven city built.

Year 7,500
First human ""towns"" in Ven

Year 9,000
First Tharuden city formed.

Year 9,100
Second Tharuden city built.  First High Elven city built.  

Year 9,400
First wood elves.

Year 10,000
God-King and Rhanouin Shadow-Walker born

Year 10,100
Human tribes inhabit what will be South Hetasia and Kereshay Desert

Year 10,500 
First High Elf ""Emperor"" forms capitol of new ""nation"" on site of
ancient Epoch 3 ruins and builds an army to defeat the Lizard men of the
Gallic Sea.

Year 10,600 
God-King becomes King of one of the three city states that sit on the
peninsula of Tharuden.  First written record of the mage known as
""Nureyev"" in Tharuden as an ""advisor to the God-King.

Year 11,000
Mephistopheles is born.  

Year 11,100
Chiang-To, the second High Elven ""emperor"" declares the three
city-states of the high elves as the ""World Empire"".  Begins enslaving
humans and Lizard men.  Begins using artifacts and magics not seen
before in this Epoch.
Cuts off ties with originating Elven church and avatars (now known as
""Gray Elves"" because of the color differential - the high elves on the
prime were a golden yellow in color).  Corellan was notably silent on
the matter to the surprise of the Elven Church- so it was allowed to
happen.

Year 12,000
The Empire known by the humans as the ""Golden Empire"" expands to cover
more territory starting to absorb fledgling human ""states"" and killing
or enslaving all the populations therein.

Year 13,000
GodKing declared as a God by his people- against his will 

Year 13,500
Machine ummmm ""appears"" ummm no is ummm ""built""  Ummm...

Year 13,900
Fortu ummm.. ""invented"" ummm ""appear"" umm.. :-) 

Years 14,000 - 18,000
Stuff happens.  Lots  of stuff.  The Golden Empire grows alot- covers
more of the prime.  The Golden Emperor has more power than the Highest
Priest of Corellan in Faerie.   The Quentar declare the ""Golden Elves""
anathema and break all contact. Corellan and Avatars are still ""no
comment"" on the matter. The Golden Emperor encourages non-corellan
worship of Dark and Strange Gods.  
A council of Wizards begins to have the real power in the Empire. 
God-King successfully fights off Empire again and again.  Nakor
develop.  Judges form.

Years 18,000
Lizard Men are almost wiped out. Great magics are born/re-discovered.   
Somewhere in here in a remote human hunter-gatherer tribe a woman was
born- she would be captured, become the slave or a great Golden One
wizard and, eventually, kill him and steal of all of his magics. She
would become an Eldar.  

Year 19,000
The great mage Grumsh invents Orcs.  Mephistopheles becomes the advisor
to the Golden Emperor.

Year 19,800
In the human city of Kestor a human named Arken is born.   He becomes a
paladin of Asmonar, a Herald, and a great general 

Year 20,300
Trouble in paradise. Some mages breaking off from Golden Emperor.  
Humans to the North are gathering together and organizing with
Elven(Quentar) help.  Human cities of Taroll(Quentar help) and
Kestor(help from Asmonar) and Koreth(help from God-King) all fighting
off the Empire.  Internal disputes starting to interfere with the Golden
Empire war machine, corruption and greed has taken its toll.. The once
great armies are poorly organized and involved in a giant civil war
(which is why the human cities are ""winning""- it is much like the
American revolution).

Year 20,378
Usul is born in the city of Koreth.

Year 20,400
In the city of Taroll two twins are born to the Chief of Taroll's wife: 
Heimdell and Aeroch.  Prince Taliesen and Marius Two-Blade of the
Quentar take on the training and development of those two.

Year 20,403
Usul becomes the youngest arch-mage in human history at the age of 25. 

Year 20,410
Arken becomes the King of Kestor and takes Marius Two-Blades and Aeroch
into his court and sends his son Davin to King Mallus' court.  King
Mallus sends his other son Heimdell to Koreth.  The three kingdoms form
an alliance (cemented by the trading of sons) called the Tri-Partite
Alliance.  It fights against the Golden EMpire.  Doesn't do much except
to keep its cities from being destroyed.

Year 20,418
Aeroch becomes a paladin of Asmonar, and Marius and he fight - a fight
in which, rumor has it, he kills Marius.  He is said to be the most
gifted blade master in the world at the age of 18.  Marius disappears.

Year 20,420
Heimdell becomes a paladin of Dof-Sifrin at age 20.  He and Taliesin
return to Taroll.
Usul's temples- which he calls ""libraries""- are in every human city and
settlement in the world.  Usul refuses to become a God and becomes an
Eldar at the young age of 43.  He preaches the dangers of force and the
importance of education.  Rumor has it that he has mastered ten schools
of Wizardry.  Assassins constantly try to kill the Preacher but he
always survives.

Year 20,500
Heimdell becomes the leader of his people after his ""father"" Mallus
dies.  Aeroch becomes a Herald- a lone swordsman wandering the earth. 
Heimdell begins training under Usul, Taliesin, and other Great Mages in
the arts of Magic.  
The Tri-Partite Alliance still barely holds on against the corrupt and
divided  Golden Empire. 

Year 20,600
The Archmage Gruumsh invents Trolls.  He unleashes them on some of his
political enemies.  They die.  He prepares spells and tokens to control
them so he can use them against the Tri-Partite Alliance.

Year 20,630
The Golden Emperor gathers an army together based on Gruumsh's promise
that the Trolls will be ready.  He sends his army forth against Kestor.  

Year 20,631
Kestor falls.  The devastation is horrible.  Most of the population is
killed and sacrificed.  Huge rents in reality are torn through the
Prime.  Trolls are unleashed and released into the city.
Arken and few bands of survivors flee and re-gather- then sue for
peace.  

Year 20,632
Asmonar uses the destruction of Kestor to launch an attack of Death
against all of humanity. Aeroch rebels and revokes his oath to Asmonar
and then flees Asmonar's wrath.  

Year 20,633
As the armies of the Golden Empire crush Koreth humanity flees and
gathers itself to Taroll the weakest and smallest of the human nations. 
Tharuden holds its borders and remains neutral (though constantly
bleeding weapons and high magic to the humans).  The God-King,
Dof-Sifrin, Corellan's advisors, Heimdell and Usul's people are
constantly feverishly working on a desperate plan to stop the Golden
Empire and Asmonar's plague that he has unleashed (it is guided by four
incarnates Asmonar invented:  Death, Famine, Plague, and War).

Year 20,634
Heimdell masters the Eighth School of Wizardry and the Third Discipline
under the God-King, Usul and Dof-Sifrin's tutelage.  They prepare a
Discipline Two invokation of Tremendous Power.  Their code word for the
top-secret project: ""BIFROST""  Arken, now the Incarnate of Death, 
continues to lead his rebel armies against the Golden Empire while
cutting a swath of death through the humanity he once belonged to.  

Year 20,635
The LAST YEAR of this era.  (epochs::eras::centuries::years:months)  The
beginning and the END of the Second Chaos War.  

Month 1
Usul destroys himself and the Orb of Light on top of Olympus Mountain
after having summoned Asmonar there.  Asmonar is Discipline Two
destroyed in the blast.  Everything in a couple of hundred miles is
flattened and destroyed.  The top of Olympus Mountain is destroyed.  The
incarnates are drained of their power and weakened.  Usul throw his
BANE(with Corellan's aide) such that all that serve Death cannot
withstand the light of the Sun.   Asmonar's armies die by the tens of
thousands.  The Lethar and the Tarethi flee into the night and the dark
places in the earth.

Month 2
Mephistophles assassinates the Golden Emperor and flees the capitol.  It
is believed that Gruumsh unleashes one of the old weapons found under
the city in the belief that it will enhance his powers.  He and the
Council and the capitol disappear in a tremendous explosion that creates
a crater hundreds and hundreds of miles across.  The armies of the
Golden Empire are thrown into disarray.  

Month 3 
The Gods throw themselves down onto the Prime and begin exacting
terrible vengeance.  Whole cities are eaten, demons are unleashed, great
devils, demons and Gods pour across the surface.  

Months 4-9
Millions of living beings die.  The Dwarves hide deep in their caves the
elves retreat to Faerie, and the humans desperately fight to stay
alive.  It is literally hell on earth.  Only the daylight is a respite
from some of the enemies, but the gods still battle.  The remnant of the
Na-Kor flee to the mountains and hide, humans that lived for a thousand
years under Nakor and Golden One cross-breeding and control flee to the
south and east under the Judges.

Month 10
Taroll is run over and destroyed by remnants of the Golden Empire's
armies.
In the final act of the War  Heimdell goes to the top of what is left of
Olympus mountain and casts the final part of the Bifrost Invokation.  
The Incarnates try to kill him while all are busy praying and casting
but Aeroch shows up suddenly ands defends Heimdell, killing all of the
Incarnates except for Arken who flees after they fight to a draw.  The
blast of the spell is fueled by all of Dof-Sifrin's and Heimdell's souls
and Dau_Penn and Correllan support it with their will as well. 

Most of the Gods' creations and avatars are are destroyed in the spell
and the world is re-shaped.  

Year 0(2100 years ago)
The sun rises on a new world... (in a Quentar city in the middle of
faerie in the first heartbeats after the Chaos War an elven child is
born.  She will be known as Madra....)

"Re: BT: Quick Sequence Question on BT History","Just a few quick observations:

1. It almost appears as if your description of epochs is much more straightforward than my description of cycles.  It sounds like epochs are strongly entrenched in time (whereas my description of cycles is not).  I.e. on could say pretty much that an event in the third epoch preceded an event in the current epoch without ambiguity.  I was viewing them as a little more funky discipline context like in that the end of the ""previous cycle"" caused the entire current cycle but any entity which survived the end of that cycle would appear in the middle of this cycle (the old god created the world in seven days but he/she created it with a history and all of the geological evidence to support it).

What flavor of epoch should I use for Kua-Toa based stories?
What falvor of epoch should I use for Nuryev based stories?

I would suggest cycles for Kua-Toa and Epochs for Nuryev (since he is human) unless I am completely offbase all together with the cycle thing.

2.  Ahh.  So there were insects in your world.  Fascinating.  One must wonder where they are now.

Epoch 1 - Elemental
Epoch 2 - Insects - first Sorceries
Epoch 3- Amphiboids- first organized life - first Wizardries
Epoch 4- Dragons- Lizards
Epoch 5- (our Epoch)


3.    Okay.  I am not really sure what the first to epochs may have been like (it is streatching my imagination) but then again I think I will concentrate on epochs 3 and up first.  I notice that there is an entire epoch intervening between the amphiboids and the present epoch.  This kind of trashes a lot of the details I had rendered in my post (no big deal, I can work with that).  It does raise a number of questions.

Did Correllan exist in Epoch 4?
Did Correllan exist in Epoch 3?

I would assume yes to the former since you talk about Fairy in the start of the epoch.  I would assume no on the latter (at least not in his current form).  Now that I think about it I suspect he probably did have some prior forms that he is not to vocal bout now.

Actually looking over your timeline I realize the extra epoch does not really change many of the details of how I imagined the Kua-Toa/Slaad war affecting the current epoch.  It merely raises the question of what effect did it have on the last epoch (and what did the last epoch look like)?

BTW:  Does the existance of Epoch 4 imply that there were no dragons in Epoch 3?  I would assume that it just means that the dragons did not rule in Epoch 3.

I will parse this more fully.  Cool stuff.

    Hmmm... tricky question that.  The Elves would say 300,000 human years
    ago when Corellan came into existence.  (compared to this time frame-
    temporality was different then so it is a little of a silly question.  A
    year is given for comparative purposes)

    Hmmmm... unclear when the transition was from who she was a a ""mortal""
    to who she was a a ""Goddess"".  Was not a huge, climactic event- it was a
    gradual shift over time.  BALL PARK: 1200 years ago.

    The elves would say there are none or few..  The Chaos Wars are labeled
    such after the event- they are labels for transition periods caused by
    diffractive fighting amongst the powers that are.  
    
    The one consistent clue is the divination sees a giant blank wall
    approaching.  This doesn't MEAN there is a Chaos War - only that there
    is a conflict of a size that it could be one.  The upcoming Lich event
    meets this criterion.
    
    Here is a big scale time line as I see it: (for this Epoch)
    
    Epoch 1 - Elemental
    Epoch 2 - Insects - first Sorceries
    Epoch 3- Amphiboids- first organized life - first Wizardries
    Epoch 4- Dragons- Lizards
    Epoch 5- (our Epoch)
    
    (Years are approximate- that is why they are so even! :-)  Also it is
    centric to people and events that you know and care about!  So it is
    biased.  )
    
    Year 0
    First Chaos War- Hell, Abyss formed (re-formed??); Faerie survives
    though vastly diminished!
    
    Old races almost entirely wiped out; Lizardmen and Dragons crippled and
    enfeebled go into recuperation; Dau-Penn and Kisereth banished...little
    animals spread, breed and form.  ""Balance "" established? 
    
    Year 500  
    First Dwarves, Ogres, Wolves
    
    Year 2500
    First Humans, Gnomes, Giants
    
    Year 4000
    First Dwarven city built.
    
    Year 7,500

    Year 9,000
    First Tharuden city formed.
    
    Year 9,100
    Second Tharuden city built.  First High Elven city built.  
    
    Year 9,400
    First wood elves.
    
    Year 10,000
    God-King and Rhanouin Shadow-Walker born
    
    Year 10,100
    Human tribes inhabit what will be South Hetasia and Kereshay Desert
    
    Year 10,500 
    First High Elf ""Emperor"" forms capitol of new ""nation"" on site of
    ancient Epoch 3 ruins and builds an army to defeat the Lizard men of the
    Gallic Sea.
    
    Year 10,600 
    God-King becomes King of one of the three city states that sit on the
    peninsula of Tharuden.  First written record of the mage known as
    ""Nureyev"" in Tharuden as an ""advisor to the God-King.
    
    Year 11,000
    Mephistopheles is born.  
    
    Year 11,100
    Chiang-To, the second High Elven ""emperor"" declares the three
    city-states of the high elves as the ""World Empire"".  Begins enslaving
    humans and Lizard men.  Begins using artifacts and magics not seen
    before in this Epoch.
    Cuts off ties with originating Elven church and avatars (now known as
    ""Gray Elves"" because of the color differential - the high elves on the
    prime were a golden yellow in color).  Corellan was notably silent on
    the matter to the surprise of the Elven Church- so it was allowed to
    happen.
    
    Year 12,000
    The Empire known by the humans as the ""Golden Empire"" expands to cover
    more territory starting to absorb fledgling human ""states"" and killing
    or enslaving all the populations therein.

    Fortu ummm.. ""invented"" ummm ""appear"" umm.. :-) 
    
    Years 14,000 - 18,000
    Stuff happens.  Lots  of stuff.  The Golden Empire grows alot- covers
    more of the prime.  The Golden Emperor has more power than the Highest
    Priest of Corellan in Faerie.   The Quentar declare the ""Golden Elves""
    anathema and break all contact. Corellan and Avatars are still ""no
    comment"" on the matter. The Golden Emperor encourages non-corellan
    worship of Dark and Strange Gods.  
    A council of Wizards begins to have the real power in the Empire. 
    God-King successfully fights off Empire again and again.  Nakor
    develop.  Judges form.
    
    Years 18,000
    Lizard Men are almost wiped out. Great magics are born/re-discovered.   
    Somewhere in here in a remote human hunter-gatherer tribe a woman was
    born- she would be captured, become the slave or a great Golden One
    wizard and, eventually, kill him and steal of all of his magics. She
    would become an Eldar.  
    
    Year 19,000
    The great mage Grumsh invents Orcs.  Mephistopheles becomes the advisor
    to the Golden Emperor.
    
    Year 19,800
    In the human city of Kestor a human named Arken is born.   He becomes a
    paladin of Asmonar, a Herald, and a great general 
    
    Year 20,300
    Trouble in paradise. Some mages breaking off from Golden Emperor.  
    Humans to the North are gathering together and organizing with
    Elven(Quentar) help.  Human cities of Taroll(Quentar help) and
    Kestor(help from Asmonar) and Koreth(help from God-King) all fighting
    off the Empire.  Internal disputes starting to interfere with the Golden
    Empire war machine, corruption and greed has taken its toll.. The once
    great armies are poorly organized and involved in a giant civil war
    (which is why the human cities are ""winning""- it is much like the
    American revolution).
    
    Year 20,378
    Usul is born in the city of Koreth.
    
    Year 20,400
    In the city of Taroll two twins are born to the Chief of Taroll's wife: 
    Heimdell and Aeroch.  Prince Taliesen and Marius Two-Blade of the
    Quentar take on the training and development of those two.
    
    Year 20,403
    Usul becomes the youngest arch-mage in human history at the age of 25. 
    
    Year 20,410
    Arken becomes the King of Kestor and takes Marius Two-Blades and Aeroch
    into his court and sends his son Davin to King Mallus' court.  King
    Mallus sends his other son Heimdell to Koreth.  The three kingdoms form
    an alliance (cemented by the trading of sons) called the Tri-Partite
    Alliance.  It fights against the Golden EMpire.  Doesn't do much except
    to keep its cities from being destroyed.
    
    Year 20,418
    Aeroch becomes a paladin of Asmonar, and Marius and he fight - a fight
    in which, rumor has it, he kills Marius.  He is said to be the most
    gifted blade master in the world at the age of 18.  Marius disappears.
    
    Year 20,420
    Heimdell becomes a paladin of Dof-Sifrin at age 20.  He and Taliesin
    return to Taroll.
    Usul's temples- which he calls ""libraries""- are in every human city and
    settlement in the world.  Usul refuses to become a God and becomes an
    Eldar at the young age of 43.  He preaches the dangers of force and the
    importance of education.  Rumor has it that he has mastered ten schools
    of Wizardry.  Assassins constantly try to kill the Preacher but he
    always survives.

>Eighth School ?

Prior to Madra the number of schools would be dramatically less.  I would 
guess the following:

Tharuden Schools -
Warding, Shaping, Binding
Seeing, Prophecy, Communing
Will Working

Assuming he did not learn Rhellanian Schools which at the time would be Golden Empire schools this would leave:

The Ways: Travelling, Gating, Altering, Shifting, Greater Summoning

or Chronomancy (the school of his own creation)

the point is I think Alex meant his Eight School not the Eight School, and yea its gross.  So Hiemdall is gross, is that a suprise?

Of course if he meant eight like:
Abjuration, Divination, Will Working, Conjuration, Alteration, Summoning

then it would be really interesting becuase it would mean he either learned some Rhelanian schools (possible) or some other wizardries which might have been the predecessors of Madras.  Oh, wait, if Arken was around then that means he could have learned Death, Dark or Decay as well.  Hmm, this is confusing.

Never mind.  I have no idea.

    Hmmm. Interesting. I was given to understand (by Labelas) that the original
    Balance was met/agreed upon first by Dau-Pen and Correlan, and a few others
    and that Kisoreth came (was brought ?) ""to the table"" later on. Also, the

    Chuckle. I was told by Taliesen that the Golden-Ones, Na-Kor and other
    Scions of the Golden Ones
    were hunted by the Faer-Han until even they sickened of the slaughter. Madra
    convinced the
    Faer-Han that should would stand surety against them ever gaining empire
    again and so the hunt
    was ended.

    Hmmm. Interesting. This would indicate that the incarnates held
    more power at that time.
    
    A little more than I expected .

That matches what Labelas would have told you and it is the truth.  :-)

Check!  Around 1000 years after the Second Chaos War is when the Quentar
got sick of the hunt.

No as- in Dal Kon Judges.  They then handed over rule of the people to
the warrior class and continued to judge disputes as an attempt to
balance power and never have the Golden Empire phenomenon again.  

As you can see they failed because the roder lost sight of its original
purpose and the Dal Kon people have an Emporer again!

The Phelosian Wise Woman.  Baba Yaga is even older and not mentioned

See Pookies post.  The ""Eighth school "" was Chronomancy. I leav eit as

"Re: BT: Quick Sequence Question on BT History","
Just a few quick observations:
 
1. It almost appears as if your description of epochs is much more
straightforward than my description of cycles.  It sounds like epochs
are strongly entrenched
in time (whereas my description of cycles is not).  I.e. on could say
pretty much that an event in the third epoch preceded an event in the
current epoch without
ambiguity.  I was viewing them as a little more funky discipline context
like in that the end of the ""previous cycle"" caused the entire current
cycle but any entity
which survived the end of that cycle would appear in the middle of this
cycle (the old god created the world in seven days but he/she created it
with a history
and all of the geological evidence to support it).

>>>
>NOTE:  The post with the CHRONOLOGY was extremly entrenched in the concept of >linear time.  By definition.  EPOCHS are REALITIES.  Humans just think of them >as causal and therefore rank them by their effect on each other.   When one does >that one come sup with the order I presented.  
>>>

What flavor of epoch should I use for Kua-Toa based stories?

>>> CYCLE.

What falvor of epoch should I use for Nuryev based stories?

>>> EPOCH
 
I would suggest cycles for Kua-Toa and Epochs for Nuryev (since he is
human) unless I am completely offbase all together with the cycle thing.

>>> AGREED.
 
2.  Ahh.  So there were insects in your world.  Fascinating.  One must
wonder where they are now.

>>> INDEED.
 
Epoch 1 - Elemental
Epoch 2 - Insects - first Sorceries
Epoch 3- Amphiboids- first organized life - first Wizardries
Epoch 4- Dragons- Lizards
Epoch 5- (our Epoch)
 
3.    Okay.  I am not really sure what the first to epochs may have been
like (it is streatching my imagination) but then again I think I will
concentrate on epochs 3
and up first.  I notice that there is an entire epoch intervening
between the amphiboids and the present epoch.  This kind of trashes a
lot of the details I had
rendered in my post (no big deal, I can work with that).  It does raise
a number of questions.
 
Did Correllan exist in Epoch 4?

>>> YES.

Did Correllan exist in Epoch 3?

>>>YES.
 
I would assume yes to the former since you talk about Fairy in the start
of the epoch.  I would assume no on the latter (at least not in his
current form). 

>>> You didn't say IN HIS CURRENT FORM....:-) The answer:  you don't know.

Now
that I think about it I suspect he probably did have some prior forms
that he is not to vocal bout now.

>>> RIGHT ON!
 
Actually looking over your timeline I realize the extra epoch does not
really change many of the details of how I imagined the Kua-Toa/Slaad
war affecting the
current epoch.  It merely raises the question of what effect did it have
on the last epoch (and what did the last epoch look like)?


>>> 
EXACTLY!  The Dau_penn-Kisereth fight was extreemly influenced by the
Kua-To/Slaad fight.
>>>
 
BTW:  Does the existance of Epoch 4 imply that there were no dragons in
Epoch 3?  I would assume that it just means that the dragons did not
rule in Epoch 3.

>>> There were dragons in Epoch 3.
 
I will parse this more fully.  Cool stuff.

>>> Isn't it?

"Re: BT: Quick Sequence Question on BT History","Working all weekend?  Are you getting to be a workaholic?  Take it from me, it is fun some of the time but you real have to learn to turn it off on occasion.  Don't fool yourself that you can quit any time, yeah just after this one more deadline  (Speaking with the scars of experience).  Actually come to think of it why would I even think for a moment that this might be a new element to your personality?  I guess I just have not seen it applied to your job for such a consistently long period of time before (or I am frightfully unobservant).

"Next Run","Hey, I had a wild idea.  Lets schedule the next shapeshifters run.

(All of this gaming related writing I have been doing has gotten me excited to put it to use).

Of course part of the reason I have not said anything until now is that December is toast for me as is the first weekend in January.  As far as I know I am clear after that.  Let us begin the process:

JAN 02 - BAD - XCountry Ski Trip

JAN 09 - BAD - Andrea's BDay Weekend

"Spell Books","Hi,

Not that I have any free time or anything but in the non-free time I do have I have been putting together spell books for Sigmund.  That is to say I have been trying to write down all of the spells Sigmund knows (I feel like the dust has somewhat settled for me as far as Wizardries go) and get statistics for them.

Being the techno dweeber that I am I though the simplest way to do this was to create an Access database and I then created an HTML export (since I hated their HTML built-in HTML reporting).

The results of this can now be seen at my ever growing BT magic web site:
    Goto http://www.foliage.com/~jaw/Wizardries/
    Goto the Drawing Page
    Goto Spell Books at the bottom
    Click on each spell book
I now figured why not capture some of the spells for the more mainstream colleges.  Perhaps this will lead to some uniformity and predictability in spell design.

As such I invite all of you to send me any spells that you have reasonably categorized.

At a minimum for each spell I would need the following:
Name
Wizardry
Type (working, ritual...)
A short description

Additionally if you want to provide it I have room for the following in the database
Cost
DM
Casting Time & Casting Time Units
Area & Area Units
Range & Range Units

Who Researched it (I will default to you)

If you like I can mail you my Access 97 project complete with tables, a form for entering spells and a printable report for spell books but frankly I would rather centralize it.  Unfortunately I do not know how to put it on-line.  Our HTTP server is Apache and I have never made an ASP page anyway (although the form has an option for saving it as one).  Anyway, I will think of that sometime later when I have more real free time.

BTW:  For other techno dweebs I can rig an XML export very easily if there is interest

"Re: Current Date","My error, I had meant to say 2100 in this era.

I have been dweebishly entering all of the data in Alex's informative post into a relational database where I am generating several reports and plan to do some historical threads.  Since I am clear that this silly linear view of epochs and eras is purely a limitation of human brains I am not to concerned with dates from a character perspective but they are darned convenient when entering things into a database.

Do either Jim or Chris have relatively convenient time lines that I can include with this other data.

For the moment I will continue using 5th Cycle 2nd Era 2100st Year as the current date and it wont be to relevant unless I get info from someone else.

    2100 is this ERA not this Cycle.....
    
    The date into this Cycle is the 25,XXX If you look at the time line....
    
    In a linear chronologiocal paradigm:
    Era's are typically 10,000ish years, EPOCHS 100,000ish years, and then
    their are millenia(1000), centuries(100), decades(10) and years.
    
    This is a complete BS abstraction but useful for conversational
    historical speaking purposes.
    
    2100 is also a change- I think I earlier in the gaming world set the
    second Chaos War At 1800 years ago not 2100.
    
    What do you guys think?
    
    The Heartstone ritual was just weeks ago!    I was completely off!

*** ANCIENT TIMES::

Here is a big scale time line as I see it: (for this Epoch)

Epoch 1 - Elemental
Epoch 2 - Insects - first Sorceries
Epoch 3- Amphiboids- first organized life - first Wizardries
Epoch 4- Dragons- Lizards
Epoch 5- (our Epoch)

(Years are approximate- that is why they are so even! :-)  Also it is
centric to people and events that you know and care about!  So it is
biased.  )

Year 0
First Chaos War- Hell, Abyss formed (re-formed??); Faerie survives
though vastly diminished!

Old races almost entirely wiped out; Lizardmen and Dragons crippled and
enfeebled go into recuperation; Dau-Penn and Kisereth banished...little
animals spread, breed and form.  ""Balance "" established? 

Year 500  
First Dwarves, Ogres, Wolves

Year 2500
First Humans, Gnomes, Giants

Year 4000
First Dwarven city built.

Year 7,500
First human ""towns"" in Ven

Year 9,000
First Tharuden city formed.

Year 9,100
Second Tharuden city built.  First High Elven city built.  

Year 9,400
First wood elves.

Year 10,000
God-King and Rhanouin Shadow-Walker born

Year 10,100
Human tribes inhabit what will be South Hetasia and Kereshay Desert

Year 10,500 
First High Elf ""Emperor"" forms capitol of new ""nation"" on site of
ancient Epoch 3 ruins and builds an army to defeat the Lizard men of the
Gallic Sea.

Year 10,600 
God-King becomes King of one of the three city states that sit on the
peninsula of Tharuden.  First written record of the mage known as
""Nureyev"" in Tharuden as an ""advisor"" to the God-King.

Year 11,000
Mephistopheles is born.  

Year 11,100
Chiang-To, the second High Elven ""emperor"" declares the three
city-states of the high elves as the ""World Empire"".  Begins enslaving
humans and Lizard men.  Begins using artifacts and magics not seen
before in this Epoch.
Cuts off ties with originating Elven church and avatars (now known as
""Gray Elves"" because of the color differential - the high elves on the
prime were a golden yellow in color).  Corellan was notably silent on
the matter to the surprise of the Elven Church- so it was allowed to
happen.

Year 12,000
The Empire known by the humans as the ""Golden Empire"" expands to cover
more territory starting to absorb fledgling human ""states"" and killing
or enslaving all the populations therein.

Year 13,000
GodKing declared as a God by his people- against his will 

Year 13,350
Early Fortu models built/appeared/etc.

Year 13,500
Machine ummmm ""appears"" ummm no is ummm ""built""  Ummm...

Year 13,790
Linking Ward ummmm ""appears"" ummm no is ummm ""built""  Ummm.

Year 13,900
Classical Fortu ummm.. ""invented"" ummm ""appear"" umm.. :-) 

Year ~16,000
The Five make their deal with the Gods re: the Machine

Years 14,000 - 18,000
Stuff happens.  Lots  of stuff.  The Golden Empire grows alot- covers
more of the prime.  The Golden Emperor has more power than the Highest
Priest of Corellan in Faerie.   The Quentar declare the ""Golden Elves""
anathema and break all contact. Corellan and Avatars are still ""no
comment"" on the matter. The Golden Emperor encourages non-corellan
worship of Dark and Strange Gods.  
A council of Wizards begins to have the real power in the Empire. 
God-King successfully fights off Empire again and again.  Nakor
develop.  Judges form.

Years 18,000
Lizard Men are almost wiped out. Great magics are born/re-discovered.   
Somewhere in here in a remote human hunter-gatherer tribe a woman was
born- she would be captured, become the slave or a great Golden One
wizard and, eventually, kill him and steal of all of his magics. She
would become an Eldar.  

Year 19,000
The great mage Grumsh invents Orcs.  Mephistopheles becomes the advisor
to the Golden Emperor.

Year 19,800
In the human city of Kestor a human named Arken is born.   He becomes a
paladin of Asmonar, a Herald, and a great general 

Year 20,300
Trouble in paradise. Some mages breaking off from Golden Emperor.  
Humans to the North are gathering together and organizing with
Elven(Quentar) help.  Human cities of Taroll(Quentar help) and
Kestor(help from Asmonar) and Koreth(help from God-King) all fighting
off the Empire.  Internal disputes starting to interfere with the Golden
Empire war machine, corruption and greed has taken its toll.. The once
great armies are poorly organized and involved in a giant civil war
(which is why the human cities are ""winning""- it is much like the
American revolution).

Year 20,378
Usul is born in the city of Koreth.

Year 20,400
In the city of Taroll two twins are born to the Chief of Taroll's wife: 
Heimdell and Aeroch.  Prince Taliesen and Marius Two-Blade of the
Quentar take on the training and development of those two.

Year 20,403
Usul becomes the youngest arch-mage in human history at the age of 25. 

Year 20,410
Arken becomes the King of Kestor and takes Marius Two-Blades and Aeroch
into his court and sends his son Davin to King Mallus' court.  King
Mallus sends his other son Heimdell to Koreth.  The three kingdoms form
an alliance (cemented by the trading of sons) called the Tri-Partite
Alliance.  It fights against the Golden EMpire.  Doesn't do much except
to keep its cities from being destroyed.

Year 20,418
Aeroch becomes a paladin of Asmonar, and Marius and he fight - a fight
in which, rumor has it, he kills Marius.  He is said to be the most
gifted blade master in the world at the age of 18.  Marius disappears.

Year 20,420
Heimdell becomes a paladin of Dof-Sifrin at age 20.  He and Taliesin
return to Taroll.
Usul's temples- which he calls ""libraries""- are in every human city and
settlement in the world.  Usul refuses to become a God and becomes an
Eldar at the young age of 43.  He preaches the dangers of force and the
importance of education.  Rumor has it that he has mastered ten schools
of Wizardry.  Assassins constantly try to kill the Preacher but he
always survives.

Year 20,500
Heimdell becomes the leader of his people after his ""father"" Mallus
dies.  Aeroch becomes a Herald- a lone swordsman wandering the earth. 
Heimdell begins training under Usul, Taliesin, and other Great Mages in
the arts of Magic.  
The Tri-Partite Alliance still barely holds on against the corrupt and
divided  Golden Empire. 

Year 20,600
The Archmage Gruumsh invents Trolls.  He unleashes them on some of his
political enemies.  They die.  He prepares spells and tokens to control
them so he can use them against the Tri-Partite Alliance.

Year 20,630
The Golden Emperor gathers an army together based on Gruumsh's promise
that the Trolls will be ready.  He sends his army forth against Kestor.  

Year 20,631
Kestor falls.  The devastation is horrible.  Most of the population is
killed and sacrificed.  Huge rents in reality are torn through the
Prime.  Trolls are unleashed and released into the city.
Arken and few bands of survivors flee and re-gather- then sue for
peace.  

Year 20,632
Asmonar uses the destruction of Kestor to launch an attack of Death
against all of humanity. Aeroch rebels and revokes his oath to Asmonar
and then flees Asmonar's wrath.  

Year 20,633
As the armies of the Golden Empire crush Koreth humanity flees and
gathers itself to Taroll the weakest and smallest of the human nations. 
Tharuden holds its borders and remains neutral (though constantly
bleeding weapons and high magic to the humans).  The God-King,
Dof-Sifrin, Corellan's advisors, Heimdell and Usul's people are
constantly feverishly working on a desperate plan to stop the Golden
Empire and Asmonar's plague that he has unleashed (it is guided by four
incarnates Asmonar invented:  Death, Famine, Plague, and War).

Year 20,634
Heimdell masters the Eighth School of Wizardry and the Third Discipline
under the God-King, Usul and Dof-Sifrin's tutelage.  They prepare a
Discipline Two invokation of Tremendous Power.  Their code word for the
top-secret project: ""BIFROST""  Arken, now the Incarnate of Death, 
continues to lead his rebel armies against the Golden Empire while
cutting a swath of death through the humanity he once belonged to.  

Year 20,635
The LAST YEAR of this era.  (epochs::eras::centuries::years:months)  The
beginning and the END of the Second Chaos War.  

Month 1
Usul destroys himself and the Orb of Light on top of Olympus Mountain
after having summoned Asmonar there.  Asmonar is Discipline Two
destroyed in the blast.  Everything in a couple of hundred miles is
flattened and destroyed.  The top of Olympus Mountain is destroyed.  The
incarnates are drained of their power and weakened.  Usul throw his
BANE(with Corellan's aide) such that all that serve Death cannot
withstand the light of the Sun.   Asmonar's armies die by the tens of
thousands.  The Lethar and the Tarethi flee into the night and the dark
places in the earth.

Month 2
Mephistophles assassinates the Golden Emperor and flees the capitol.  It
is believed that Gruumsh unleashes one of the old weapons found under
the city in the belief that it will enhance his powers.  He and the
Council and the capitol disappear in a tremendous explosion that creates
a crater hundreds and hundreds of miles across.  The armies of the
Golden Empire are thrown into disarray.  

Month 3 
The Gods throw themselves down onto the Prime and begin exacting
terrible vengeance.  Whole cities are eaten, demons are unleashed, great
devils, demons and Gods pour across the surface.  

Months 4-9
Millions of living beings die.  The Dwarves hide deep in their caves the
elves retreat to Faerie, and the humans desperately fight to stay
alive.  It is literally hell on earth.  Only the daylight is a respite
from some of the enemies, but the gods still battle.  The remnant of the
Na-Kor flee to the mountains and hide, humans that lived for a thousand
years under Nakor and Golden One cross-breeding and control flee to the
south and east under the Judges.

Month 10
Taroll is run over and destroyed by remnants of the Golden Empire's
armies.
In the final act of the War  Heimdell goes to the top of what is left of
Olympus mountain and casts the final part of the Bifrost Invokation.  
The Incarnates try to kill him while all are busy praying and casting
but Aeroch shows up suddenly ands defends Heimdell, killing all of the
Incarnates except for Arken who flees after they fight to a draw.  The
blast of the spell is fueled by all of Dof-Sifrin's and Heimdell's souls
and Dau_Penn and Correllan support it with their will as well. 

Most of the Gods' creations and avatars are are destroyed in the spell
and the world is re-shaped.  

Year 0(2100 years ago)
The sun rises on a new world... (in a Quentar city in the middle of
faerie in the first heartbeats after the Chaos War an elven child is
born.  She will be known as Madra....)



*** CALENDAR INFO: 

(some of which will be inconsistant with above and latest calendar): 

At 6 years ago:(Kay meets Dora, the GROUP [Wei_Lee,Maeve, Raec,
Kalarina, John Mendore, Kilsorana] is formed.) It was: 

Feudal:[I think this is accurate]
455 A.M.(After Mark)

Dorian: [I think this is accurate]
about 1630ish (After the Founding of Marden)

Myth gave me a date of Day 37, Year 1346 as a current date- maybe a year
old.
I think we should go with that as Myth is the Dorian expert! That would
make Marden's founding at about 750 years after the Second Chaos War...
I wanted more of 450... Let us say an new calander was instituted and
the 1346 is the current calendar that was instituted 300 years after the
founding of Marden.

Tharuden: [NOTE: NOT!!!]
4800ish(since the beginning of the God-king's Reign) 

Dal-Kon: [I think this is accurate]
like 1300ish in the Dal-Kon Calendar(since the Diaspora), 

Tolnian:
88 in the New Tolnian Calendar since the curreent ""Dynasty"" had its
Emporer on the throne.  1500ish in the Old Tolnian calendar(when the
city-state of Strichna and Tolna became ruled by an Proconsuls).

It is a massive change.  Where did you get 2100 from?  I know that in a
message to Mochel that you sent 4 or 5 years ago you said that Marden was
founded 1800 years ago.  Although my disk files were all lost I have a lot
of print outs that put the current date (within a year or two) as 1345 MN
(Mardenal Natus).

I have the Gates of Chronos as being created about 3000 years ago, but
setting a creation date on the Gates of Chronos is kind of pointless ...

What follows is from a file that I used to have on line.  I had sent it to
Alex once, but it may have been lost between companies (lincoln labs to AVS).

People started living where Marden is today 455 years before Madra was born.

All Dates are MN
711   A Kheldar was possibly born on this date

835   A Kheldar was possibly born on this date.  More significantly, the
Citadel of 
        Seven Towers fell on this date.

855   Date Falstaff says that Kheldar was born.

873   A Kheldar was possibly born on this date

870-
900   The Mage Purge

945   The Grey Wanderers met and agreed that no two of them would meet
again in the
         same place until a certain event happened.
         ""The Black Rose"" went out of print.

972  Last meeting of the Grey Wanderers for almost 400 years.

1202 A Kheldar was born in the Garden District of Marden.  Apparently
raised an 
        orphan by the priests of a now defunct religion (The Order of
Pro-Consus).  
        He did a lot of significant things.

1259-
1260 A Kheldar led the Hetasian revolt against the Sultan.  Apparently all
the rebels 
        were executed but over 28 of Marden's 94 ""districts"" rebelled.

1342 Prince Keietah Ventir was slain while fighting a goblin horde
advancing into the
        from the wasted lands.  Duke Mallard, Lord Paladin of Heimdel, was
slain by
        NoRennan (sp?) in that battle and Arioch slew an Avatar of Arken as
it was 
        forming.  Many goblins slipped over the Wall of Thelaya and raided
the Elvish
        lands.


1345 Current Year

By the way, my ancient archives indicate that Miriel, Kheldar and Bhagar
the Elder were all students of Petrak/Petras - Master Conjurer and Master
Dreamwalker.

Shit, it's 5:00.  I have got to go to bed.  I'm sure I'll be needing one of
Kheldar's Pep pills in a couple hours.  I'm mostly caught up in reading BT
mail.  Bye,

Ummm... I don't have time right now....

> Who exactly was asmonar?

Asmonar was a Greater God on the level of King Correllan, Dof-Sifrin, Dau-Pen,
Kisereth.
He ruled Death and was strongly allied with Darkness.  He was violently opposed
to Humanity but more opposed to the Golden Empire.

> God-King        ???

The God-King of Tharuden.  He is an immortal Eldar.  He has ruled the peninsula
of Tharuden (think lush tropical river valley sort of environment) for thousands
and thousands of years.  He is the ABSOLUTE ruler of his people and they do not
expand nor do they ever contract- they are.

> Rhanouin Shadow-Walker  ??

An Eldar.  Nothing more to be said about him...

> Mephistopheles - Golden empire?  Human

He is one of the Golden Ones that made up the Golden Empire (half-Quentar,
half-Human that replaced their alliance to Air with an Alliance to Earth and
Fire, and chose the elven path at a young age).  He survived the fall of the
Golden EMpire and it is said he sold his soul to Kisereth and replaced his Light
with Darkness.   He founded the ""Black Cloud"" society of assassin/mages.  Rumor
has it that he is recently (1 year ago?) deceased at Kay's hand.

> Nakor   - Same as golden empire?

The original Na-Kor were either Golden-One human cross-breeds or Golden One
children that choose their human heritage instead of their elven.  They have
since inbred and become slightly different than that.  They are very rare, but
very powerful sorceror/warriors.

> Judges ??

The Judges are a Dal-Kon order of monks.  They are trained in a ""Tae-Kwon-DO""
like martial art and in intense ""KI"" skills, they are also trained to Truth-Read
and perform other sorcerous functions.  They are well versed in the Law and in
Dal-Kon they can arbitrate any dispute and their decisions are binding- even on
Samurai and Daimyo.  However another Judge can dispute a ruling, and the current
Emperor is flexing his muscle in terms of being able to veto a Judges decision.
Briand Beaudin's character Wei-Li is a Dal-Kon Judge.

> Grumsh - Golden Empire

Grumsh was a Golden One wizard/biologist.

> Arken - Starts good, goes bad?

Arken was a human who became a Paladin of the Greater God of Death.  He was also
a Prince of Kestor.  When he became King he was tremendously successful at
repelling the Golden Empire (until they unleashed Gruumsh's Trolls and the
Preceptors on his city).
Asmonar gave him the Incarnatehood of Death.  He is the only one who survived
the fight against Aeroch  on what would be Fire Mountain.  He then fled and
after recovering he took Asmonar's throne in the reality called Hell and has
been the God of Death since then.
The Lich ""TECHNICALLY"" serves Arken.

> Asmonar - Helps found human cities - then cause plague?

God of Death- see above.  He was looking for worshippers- then sucks their souls
when they die.  When the Golden EMpire overran Kestor he figured he better cash
in one as many human deaths as possible since he figured the model was going out
of style.

He was surprised when he was killed by one! :-)

> Usul

WHat is there to say?  You have his life story- a human, unbelievably talented,
is still worshipped today in cities all over the world.  Considered a ""God"" of
learning, light , and charity.

> Aeroch

Arioch.  Knight of Swords.  Immortal being that was human.  In this linear
chronology was Heimdell's twin brother.

> Hiemdall

Yep.  See above.  When he cast the Bi-Frost Ritual he bound himself as the
watchdog and the guardian of the Ward around the world.  He hasn't left the
Throne of Power on the Bi-Frost since then.

> -Britt

Human engineer and role-player.  Bound to another human, Rita.  His current
impact on the world is still being worked out by history....

Okay.  I know that- as I said in the quote above I DID say earlier that it was
1800 years ago.  This is a change. The question is will it cause you a problem!?

Did you see my calendar post and the whole conversation about that date?  That is
the right date.  However- that calendar started 300 years after the founding of
Marden.

3,000 years?   It kind of makes sense! :-)

That is somewhat correct!  People were living where Marden is today 455 years
before Madra gathered the tribes together and held the Council of Broca that
formed the Dorian tribal alliance that became Marden.  Madra was born in Faerie a
couple of seconds after the forming of the Bi-Frost.  Pookie- make a note of
that!! :-):-):-)

I would trust Falstaff  on this!  However- I would change the date to 555.

This has been positively identified as ""our"" Kheldar.

Yeppers... However IF we say the CURRENT year is 1345 then this would have
happened in 1339 or something like that.

Do we want to align on that or was that the current year 4 years ago?

The site is very incomplete, I have a lot of data that I have stored in a big word document but have not entered into my database yet.  Also the dates are probably very inaccurate and inconsistent.  Also the dates are all in the human dating system which is abysmal but much less complex to design a schema for.

http://www.foliage.com/~jaw/History/

Most of the current data comes directly from Alex and would be considered in the realm of common knowledge however I need to enter some form of an attribution system very quickly.  I am not going to even attempt to track dates based on different perspectives or world views.  Just take it for granted that the information here is not definitive and is only for your own amusement.  It will not stand up in a court of law.

actually I have noticed recently that Alex spells it Nureyev and I spell it Nuryev (Noor Ay Yev vs. Noor Ay Ev).  However it is all moot because it is really spelled ""arch-hawk over circlet-rising sun"" which means ""golden gateway to the past (noble form)"" in hieroglyphics.

Is the actual date number inside the tag? ie. <date calendar=dorian>1200</date>

"Re: BT: Years and Months and Days","Hmmm..... it is not precise.  Days and seasons are longer and shorter
based on the current state of balance between light and dark (i.e. who
is winning!:-))  However there are some generic things...

I, after some fooling around, standardized on a calendar like ours
because it drove players crazy otherwise.  Thus:

There are 7 days in the standard week.  The Messenger (the smallest and
fastest moon goes through its cycle in approximately this time.)

28 days in a month- for the sake of my sanity the Dragon (the biggest
moon) follows this schedule like clockwork.  The 28th is always the last
day of the full moon.

There are 12 months in a standard cycle of seasons.   Therefore there
are 336 days in a year.

There are 24 hours (more or less) in a day.   There are 60 minutes in an
hour and 60 seconds in a minute.  However- except for ritual Wizards
people don' t use seconds.  They use:

candlemark -> 15 minutes
heartbeat -> ~1 second
the quarters of the day-> noon, midnight, dawn, dusk-> also
mid-morn(9:00am), mid-work(3:00pm), mid-rest(9:00pm),
mid-sleep(3:00am).  In Maera they use the prayer station names for
these.

    -> The Tolnians began using hours about five hundred years ago as
they developed more accurate time pieces.  (They still need to be reset
at noon every day but....:-) )  Hours caught on in Doria and Dau-Sho but
no where else.  They caught on in Maera and the Franksih Lands as well
but they were called ""bells"" because the Churches tolled the hours.

"Re: Knoife","Well, I did a little proof of concept wich worked and that convinced me to ignore the whole thing.  I got the parser running and have not yet finished convertng the dates but have records importing into my db (with a flag which indicate requires further mucking before display).  Then I wanted to test it so I rummaged around on your system (sorry) and found a file called History.xml.  It took me about ten minutes to import it becuase I had to do a number of global replaces (all of the form =tag to =""tag"").  thank god for textpad becuase I was able to do it fairly quickly.  I then imported the records noticing the following problems:

There were a few (small number) of records which:
 had neither a title nor a description
had a non-numeric date

Since I could handle neither of these I just ignored those records.

I then printed a report of the results and reviewed it.  What I found was the following:  This file I read is a very detailed very short term history.  It is highly related to the characters and does not contain that many gross scale political events (although it has its share). I have a feeling that, based on this, I wuold have an easier time hand importing the event markers from your timeline than batch importing them.  I can definately export based on your DTD (although we will have to define date further) so that we can compare results.

Alternatively I may have just grabbed the wrong file off of your system in which case from a techno perspective I am able to import event objects and muck with them.

"Re: Knoife","Two notes:

For sanity pruposes I was requiring that every event have a title.  The way I work this is that on input I required every event to have either a title or a description and if it had a description only I set the title to (left$(description,??) & ""..."").  Otherwise it is just hard to browse.

As far as event scope I was initially thinking of keeping a database of events which were of historical significance.  What does that mean?  I haven't a clue.  I think it has the following practical side effects:

  I was imagining that the date granularity would, at its finest, have a granularity of a month or so.  This is not because I cant store to greater precision but more becuase I did not want to spend a lot of time adjusting dates as long as the order was OK.  Also I am well aware that the sanity of a linear temporal stream breaks down a lot when trying to compare calendars from two gaming groups.  But that is just what I was originally thinking.  There is no reason that the schema I have (upgraded to include viewpoint, etc.) could not handle that.  I gues the big issues would be as follows:

  I want to always be able to run a query which will extract a history with only historical events in it.  This is what I am describing on the current timeline on the web site.  My plan was to then generate a number of threads (like shapeshifters or the history of Hiemdall & Aeroch) with much greater detail off of the same database.  I can easily do this by just including a flag on each event IsHistoricalEvent : boolean.

  I do not want to be responsible for the entry of individual party specific or character specific information.  Entries like ""Mordenaith created a 150 pt spell battery"" or even ""Mordenaith gets permission to court whats-er-name""  need to be enterable by the person most interested in their general publication.  I see this as easily handled by one of two mechanisms:

  I have created a simple CGI at the moment that scapes values off of a form, builds an XML object with them and mails it to me.  I can build some simple mechanism to send a bunch of these to a file and import them using the xml importer I created for your DTD.  Alternatively if there are a lot of events someone can just send them to me in this common format and I can bulk import them.  There are a host of issues involved in this such as how do you specificy a record deletion or what sort of  collision detection do you need for accidently importing the same data twice but I think these are workable issues.

The one restriction that I think is worth keeping on the database is that no data should be stored in the database which is not viewable by all PLAYERS.  If we put a little character scoping on it that is fine but I never want to implement any security nor do I think it is worthwhile to have the DB be a personal repository for anyones history.  It should be for the purpose of making information available to other players.

Sound good?

    Well, I did a little proof of concept wich worked and that convinced me to ignore the whole thing.  I got the parser running and have not yet finished convertng the dates but have records importing into my db (with a flag which indicate requires further mucking before display).  Then I wanted to test it so I rummaged around on your system (sorry) and found a file called History.xml.  It took me about ten minutes to import it becuase I had to do a number of global replaces (all of the form =tag to =""tag"").  thank god for textpad becuase I was able to do it fairly quickly.  I then imported the records noticing the following problems:

    Yeah , it looks like my XML was more like SGML . I will fix that at lunch.
     
    There were a few (small number) of records which:
    had neither a title nor a description
    had a non-numeric date

    Yup. They need to be fixed, though  a title is not a mandatory element.
     
    Since I could handle neither of these I just ignored those records.

    I then printed a report of the results and reviewed it.  What I found was the following:  This file I read is a very detailed very short term history.  It is highly related to the characters and does not contain that many gross scale political events (although it has its share). I have a feeling that, based on this, I wuold have an easier time hand importing the event markers from your timeline than batch importing them.  I can definately export based on your DTD (although we will have to define date further) so that we can compare results.

    Hmmm. That file is indeed the current shoirt term history. I would like to generate a full detail database from which 
    we can extract the major and minor events as we need them. Would you prefer that we don't do that with your DB ?
     
    Alternatively I may have just grabbed the wrong file off of your system in which case from a techno perspective I am able to import event objects and muck with them.

"Re: Knoife","Heres what I was planning.

Since I am publishing as web pages and I do not have a convenient real-time db<->web page link at the moment I was not going to support searches.  Instead I was going to support a concept of threads.

The main history would be output as a single list of major chronological events formatted as it currently is on the web page.

Following the chronological list I was going to have a series of threads each corresponding to a significant name, person or group.

I was imagining threads as working in one of two ways:

In both cases you would start a thread by creating a major name for it (like Aeroch or Shape Shifters, etc.)

In the manual case you would then attach all relevant events to the thread by linking them (rather than having attributes).  From a database point of view the distinction is that you don;t have to change the schema every time you add a new thread since the connections is via a link record rather than a fixed field in the schema.  The disadvantage is that the UI for specifiying these things is more awkward and the use case probably ends up being (1) define event (2) individually add event to each thread it relates to.  This is a multi-stage process and more likely to ""miss"" relevant events but is simpler to implement and requires less maintance from a db persepective (more for a data perspective).

I am also thinking of implementing an automatic case.  In this case you not only enter a single word thread name but also a number of aliases for the thread.  I would then build an automatic process which would run through every event in the Db and link up to the thread any event which contained something from the word list for the thread. This is much easier to maintain from a data perspective since you can always wipe out all of the thread links and regenerate them.  It does suffer from the hazard of false hits (events at which Sigmund's Sword of Aeroch play a part show up on the thread for Aeroch) and much more common frequent misses (it will take a while for all of the Forsetti and City of Law references to show up, mis spelling becomes more deadly and some links will just not be practical - e.g. Blade of Stone = Kheldar?).

Despite its limitations I am leaning towards the latter.  The whole idea of both of them is rather than interactive searches pre-run all of the common searches and store them as historical pathways through the growing mass of events.

Actually, I just realized to make the whole auto-search thing manageable I can just include a Db field for non-displayed tags that is searched when generating thread contents.  Then you can always override to include something in a thread.  And I dont think there is anything wrong with over-reporting events.  Just dont name any major historical figure ""The"" or ""NaMed"".

Initial threads (once I implement all of this of course) would be:

Shape Shifters
  ShapeShifters, Mordenaith, Morphus, Kheldar, Odin?, Wotan?, Sigmund, Nuryev?, Kilsorana, Khalid, Erithmaeon, E-Man, Catbird, Dullo, Arak, Singing Warrior, Vartigan
The Five
  Falstaff, Kheldar, Logos, Rhismaeon, Nuryev, Sigmund, Linking Ward
Elves
  Faer-Han, Quentar, Golden Ones,...
Gray Wanderers
MKP
Aeroch & Hiemdell

Atlernatively I do have 5 boolean fields associated with each record at the moment and I could provide mega threads for each of these topics:

    IsGods - All events related to gods
    IsPolitics - All events related to kingdoms and rulership
    IsRaces - All events related to race creation/evolution
    IsPeople - All events related toi specific peoples major timelines (birth, death, crowned king,...)
    IsMagic - All events related to the history of magic

  Sounds good to me! 
  I think it might be worth setting tags for/by: 
  specific groups (kay/dora&sterling, etc.) 
  races (elves, dwarves, gods, general) 
  location (Marden, Doria, Maera, Feudal States- although Marden should be FreeStates:Doria:Marden so a search for historical events in the Free states would pick it up.  Does that make sense?) 

  This is exciting!

"Re: Knoife","Either way is fine with me.  The point of the IsCommonHistory flag was so that I could mark the subset of major events in the database that formed the common historical basis for all PLAYERS (not necessarily characters - I think it is good for players to know certain high level pieces of info their character may not have access to as long as they know whether or not their character has access to them).  This would allow information intended for other purposes to be stored in the same repository without problem.

BTW: Alex - I have all of the events stored in an access DB which is my primary source.  The HTML pages can be regenerated from these at any time and are just a convenient form for publication.

Also, I am thinking I am just going to include a general tags string and go with word matching to provide linking.

I would consider the location attribute but I think we should design the categorization system well up front. (is Koreth part of Tharuden?  Was it 10,000 years ago? Is Marden part of the Golden Empire?)

  Hmmm. It looks like you and I have different requirements out of a database.
  My end goal is to be able to generate a document (HTML or RTF or XML ) that 
  represents a selected slice of history (GMs knowledge, World according to All PCs, 
  a group of PCs or a specific character. This could be used for indexing and 
  cross-referencing.  I think that I may be better off simply be able to accept an 
  export of the Major Events DB and merge it with the total history document.
   
  I would then suggest that the ONLY things that get published in the DB are the major 
  historical markers that affect all players and are part of some general consensus history.

  Does that make sense to you ?
   
  As far as changes to the schema a Locale tag makes sense (plane, country, city, etc...) 
  but a group tag maybe problematic. Characters float enough that it could be a real pain.

"Re: Knoife","OK Mr. ""This is so simple""

What are the top level areas Du'Jour?  Are they roughly the same as the list
of Countries with a few regions thrown in?

Feudal States
    Maera, Frankish Lands?, Kaern? (sp?)
Free States
    Doria, Hetasia

Are Tolnia, Bengali, Tharuden and Venn free states or a separate area?

Are Rhelania, Dal-Kon and Kusing one area?

Is the Kereshay an Area?

Where are:
    Tarethi Lands
    Kalintora
    Pentarra
    Dao-Shoa
    Phelosia
    The Ice Fortress
    The Isle of Law?
    The City of Law?
    The Dwarven Kingdoms?

Now, is Faerie an area? Multiple Areas?
How about Hell?  The Abyss?

I think this is all fine for the present but I dont see how it works for the
past.

The current lat-lon for Pentarra and Marden represent areas that during the
hieght of the Golden Empire were within the Golden Empires domain.  So what
if Marden was a sea at the time.

Perhaps its not so bad.  If you approach locations from a cultural context
rather than a geographical one then you can say that an events location is
the cultural conversation that had predominance in that area at the time.
Thus the location of the capitol of the golden empire is Golden
Empire:Capitol not Big Ocean:Ruins Underwater and it is entirely possible
that one major event will be tagged ""Golden Empire:City Caves of
Salaam:Great Library"" and another ""Bengali:City Caves of Salaam:Ruins of the
Great Library"".

I would believe that the number of areas that have changed so much from
their representation in the past that they need new names is small.

Okay, I'm sold if you can buy into this.

"Re: Bardic Tales Calendar and History stuff","I would love to if I were not teaching yoga (I assume you mean tonight).  I just stuck your calendar discussion up on the history site and reformatted a little.  I managed to eek out automatic thread generation but all it managed to show is that misspelling can be deadly.  Still, it is kind of handy.  I whacked in a concept of location and would like to propose something like the following:


Plane       Region            Nation        City
Prime
            Free States       Doria         Marden
                              Hetasia
                              Bengali

            The Dwarvish Kingdoms
            Southern Lands    Venn
                              Tharuden
            The Kereshay
            Eastern Lands     Pentarra
            The Far East      Rhellania
                              Dal-Kon
                              Kusing?
            The Liche's Domain

            Where? 
                The City of Law
                Dau-Shoa
                Phelosia
                The High Elven City?
Faerie     (more than one region?)
The Abyss
Hell
Dragon Home
Keeristaen
Neutrality
The Elemental Planes?

Past Prime Locations Distinct from Their Current Counterparts
    The Golden Empire (from current day Marden and East) whose capitol is now under water
    The Sea-Faring Nation which lived in current day Marden
    The dwarvish kingdom now under Corellans Footprint

I assume that Kestor and Tarroll were part of some long gone culture similar to the Feudal States
I assume that Koreth was part of Tharuden (would it sillt be considered so?)

BTW:  Alex.  A long time ago I sent you a historical description of the culture that existed in the Dorian area at the time of the Golden Empire.  Do you have that?  I think I list my copy.

Now as to the meat of this, with corrected containment and spellings:

Prime

Kusing came from Kusing Province listed as a mage center in chris's mage notes.  I assume it is part of something else.

What about the high elvish city that Gilliam (sp?) comes from.  Is that in Bengali?

Is Koreth currrently considered to be in Tharuden?

>From your comments it appeared that Dao-Shoa is its own region rather than part of either the feudal or free states.

I find it odd the way you say that Koreth is not part of the Tharuden, instead it is a human city.  It almost implies that Tharuden is not populated by humans.  I assumed that Koreth was part of Tharuden becuase you mentioned that the God-King ruled there.

"Re: Bardic Tales Calendar and History stuff","OKay, I aplogize.  I should have known that if anything wierd was happening to e-mail it is my fault since I voluntarily upgraded to IE 5.0 beta despite all warnings and admonitions to the contrary.

Also:

I don't know what Kusing is but it always sounded Chines to me making me think it was part of Rhelania or thereabouts.

I found the reason I thought Koreth was part of Tharuden.  It was a simple sentence:

    Human cities of Taroll (Quentar help) and Kestor (help from Asmonar) and Koreth (help from God-King) are all fighting off the Golden Empire.

That I misinterpretted grossly.

Okay, thanks for the input.  I got your other dates post but have not processed it yet.  Too busy.

  ALEX SAYS: (inserting manually)

  It is something unique in  the formatting of YOUR mail messages.  When
  anyone else sends me stuff my mailer handles it properly- if it is
  non-HTML it puts > in front of their text and leaves mine plain.  If it
  is HTMl it jumps out of indent when I hit return and thus properly
  segregates th two.  For some strange reason your messages have not been
  doing that.  When I hit return they keep the indent instead of jumping
  out of it.  You are the only person that this happens to me with.

  classical first big human centers of population besides Tharuden.  I
  always tend to place Tharuden in a place by itself.  

  The God-King did NOT rule in Koreth.  Ever to the best of my knowledge! 
  And Koreth is certainly not part of the peninsula of Tharuden.   It is
  slightly north and east of Tolnia and 450 miles south and a little west
  of Marden.

"Maps","After talking about regions for the histories my mind wandered back to the map so I imported Jim's scanned bitmap into Adobe Illustrator and did a little tracing.  I have the full map as a two layer plot in EPS at the moment but I generated these two images off of it.  I want to add additional layers for cities and terrain types.  Layers are nice becuase you can store it all in one file but only print the info you want.

Does anyone know of a tool which allows you to do pattern fills from a bitmap?  I have some really great map textures and icons but I cant figure out how to make a raster image into a ""swatch"" in adobe.

BTW:  Since adobe is a vector product I can produce zoom in images off the same original for area sub-maps.

"Maps","I have located a tool that reads Illustrator and can write DXF (though I have not tested it yet).  This tool may be a little limited since it does not preserve layers on import, although it does preserve object identity.  I got this tool becuase I was experimenting with some pattern fills to make nice textured maps.  I almost have it but I am running into a really annoying problem regarding the interpretation of inside and outside (large concave curves like the bay kestor is on and the one between Rhellania and Pentarra tend to get filled with grass while the neighboring land is ocean).

I am also discovering that Illustrator is a much better tool for moving anchor points on an irregular surface.  I suspect you will want to fix all coastlines the way you like them before moving into DXF format.

I own Campaign Cartographer 2, Dungeon Designer 2 and the AD&D Core Rules
2.  I think that Peter is still running the DOS version of CC, but I'm not
sure.  There is another product called City Designer that hasn't been
released at the rev 2 level yet.  The rev 2 level is critical.  The user
interface in the early product is not user friendly or Windows 95/NT
friendly.  

I mention the Core Rules product because it contains a somewhat limited
version of the CC2 product that creates compatible files.  Amazon.com was
selling Core Rules for $31.00 but it has steadily risen ($47.00) as of this
email) as Christmas approaches.  My guess is that it will go down again,
but the standard price is about $60.00.  I mention this because even if you
just want to use the map function of the product, you should be able to
read any map created with the CC2 product and could probably make
significant modifications to any map.  We should test that if anyone wants
to go that route.

> Jim Everett-Wilson wrote:

Yes.  Well- hold on- to be perfect:

1. Bengali and Tolnia should both be lower.  As a matter of fact the
whole Western seaboard below the Dragon's teeth- the entrance to the bay
of Sargon should slide down ummm... the bottom of Thelaya should be
where the northern edge of the northern mountain range above Bengali
is.  Everything below that should slide down that far. 

2. The bay of Sargon has a flat southern border.  I.e. its southern
border runs east-west.  It is also a little thinner in the bottom bulge.

The river (responding to your question below) actually starts 3/4 of an
"" inch "" lower on the bay, arcs up a little and then bends down down
down to the Immyrl sea.  

2.  Bengali should be bigger and Tolnia should be smaller.  Bengali in
my mind is a little bigger than half the size of Doria- and Doria can't
get any smaller on this map so Bengali should be about half again to
three quarters again bigger.

3. The forest in the north of Maera extends to just North of the Bay of
Sargon and then ends abruptly.  One of the ""constructed"" things visible
from ""orbit"" on this world is the abrupt demarcation that the Wall of
Thelaya is.  

4.  In that forest the Kymri are on the far right and the High Elves
(the city of Yris) are on the far left.  

5.  There is a small desert smack in the middle of Northern Bengali that
has a small tail hanging out of it s middle.  There is another larger
desert smack in the middle of Southern bengali.  Khalid's people come
from there...

6.  Phelosia is further north and not a big region- it is tucked right
under Dau-Shoa. (it is considerably north of Marden)

7. Tolnia is smaller.

8.  Tharuden is much longer and skinnier stretching more east-west.  It
is a thin small peninsula

9. The lake in Hetasia looks a little more like the finger lakes region
of New York.  It is two or three fairly large lakes that have lost of
rivers and lakes in-between.  Gazed Lah is on the southern border of the
largest and east most of the three lakes.  They stretch more east west
than North SOuth.  

10. It isn't really mountains between Bengali and Frankish Lands it is
high hills.  

11.  Southern hetasia is quite hilly (i.e. around Gazed-Lah.  It is
hills. )

Thelaya is definitely NOT a forest!  It is badlands- rough, occasionally
hilly arid terrain.

Not butchered- it is close.

> Since passes through the mountains are strategically significant do I
> have them accurate?

Hm,mmmm.... ummm.... Okay I am going to work counterclockwise around the
map starting with the Terethi lands to the north (where CHris' vikings
live)  

1. There is no pass between the Dwarven mountains and the Terethi
mountains - it is one contiguous chain.

2. The pass between Maera and Pentara is still hills.  There is no
flatland there.

This next region (issues 3 through 5) is hard because the changes are
many and subtle: 

3. There are no flatland passes through the Mayar Hills (above Doria and
Dau-Shoa)

4. The Mayar hills reach almost up to the Immyrl sea- on a map of this
scale it would almost look like the southern border of the immyrl sea
was in the Mayar hills.  

5. The opening between The Bay of Sargon and the Mayar Hills (i.e. the
pass between Frankland and Maera) is quite narrow (this is partially
related to the sliding the west coastline down a bit)  There is also a
narrow pass- but larger- that leads between Doria and Frankland.

6. The mountains the Nakor live in- the mountains between Doria and
Bengali and longer north-south and a little skinnier.  The pass is
actually a diagonal pass in to North Eastern Tolnia not into Doria at
all.  It is below Koresh(th).

7. The pass between the Kereshay and Hetasia is narrower.  Perhaps a
quarter of that width.

No Lichland is s small circle (looks like an impact crater with the
biggest mountain in the World in the middle of it.  In the crater itself
is all flatlands (except in the middle;-))  It is located to the
South-East of Dau-Shoa (there borders touch and it is blocked by
mountains from contact with Phelosia.  The circle is almost the width of
the mountain range!!!!(around 3/4)

> How big is Dwarf Land? Is it all of the northen mountains?

They think it is but really they only really manage the North-Eastern
part of that range.

> What is that big area below the cliffs with the Ice Fortress but above

Northern Rhelania??? :-) 

> Where is cetania and what is it?

Cetania is that area of land above the Kereshay and Below Pentara.   
You have no idea what it is! :-)

It covers it all!!!!!!!

Some comments: 

1.  The Lich's domain is entirley surrounded by mountains.  I can get
that what I said would have been deceiving- but it it does have a thing
layer (15-25 km as crow flies_ of mountains between its edge and
Dau-Shoa. 

2. Northern Doria up to the Mayar hills is mostly desert.  (at least
four days travel worth whatever that is....)

3.  You followed my instructions too well.  I would shave a little off
the top of the Mayar Hills- but that is really close.

4. The mountains directly to the east of Tolnia are too big.  Ther eis a
HUGE opening between Tolnia and Doria.  

5.  The mountains to the north of Tolnia are thinner and would look more
like a wall between Tolnia and Bengali (except for the opening 

6.  i would cut another 1/2 inch off the western part of Tharuden.  It
really is small.  It is too big on the map right now.  

7. See Bay of Sargon comments below.

Okay.  It was poorly written- I wa sin a hurry- sorry Pook.  Here is
what I would like to see:

See that big bump of land extending South-East into the Bay from
Thelaya?  Drown it.  Have it bee under water. Just look at how the south
coast runs North-East and then currently curves down to make the bump? 
Have it just keep going until it reaches water again.  DOes that make
sense?

Awesome!  

Some comments:  

1. The northern Tolnian mountains should be skinnier. and stretched more
east-west

2.  The eastern Tolnian mountains should stay the same but slide down
until they are almost touching the Bay of Tharuden (not official title-
just convenience title)

3.  The Fingers of God - a Bengali title for the mountains between
Bengali and Doria- should become longer north-south by extending lower
to below the bottom of the desert.

4.  The Great Northern FOrest (above Maera) extends all the way up into
the foothills of the Dwarven Mountains.  The Wall of Thelaya includes a
North-South Wall that runs straight north to the Dwarven mountains and
then takes a sharp turn westward to run to the ocean.  Everything to the
east of that wall is the great forest.

5. Tharuden is all JUNGLE.  Lush Brazilian rain forest type.....

6.  The Northern Dorian desert has a thin strip of plains between it and
the Fingers of God AND it only extends as far east as the western border
of Phelosia, but it runs North all the way to the Mayar Hills.  Its
southern border might be as little higher too.... 

7.  In the Kereshay about a quarter of the way across starting at the
South-Eastern corner going west a tiny spur of high mountains thrusts
north into the Desert about a quarter of the way into it.

"Bardic Map","Well, I have incorporated all of the comments as of Friday.  You might want to proof the Tolnia- Bengali-Doria Passes since I am not sure if they are OK.

Also, I have been fiddling more with regions (aside from making them black dashes instead of white so they are easier to read).

What do you think of Phelosia and Dao-Shoa?  I assume Fire Mountain borders Dao-Shoa but no Phelosia.

Did I get Hetasia right?  I have the Kereshay not bordering Doria directly.  I also have Hetasia to the east of the sea but not to the North or west.  Is that OK?  If this is OK what is to the are to the west of the sea/east of tharuden/south of doria/north of Venn?

Any other observations?

Do we have a revision 1.0 sign off on the coastline (meaning nothing more than should I make another DXF snapshot and move on to better things)?

"Map","For today:

Incorporated yesterdays changes.

Added new layers for a hex grid and cities.

Exported 3 seperate JPGs.

Made up the locations of a few things (like Tolnia and Strichna) as well as put place holders for the 3 Tharuden city states.
Also if you can check the regions (which may be easier to read now) that would be great.


As far as distances I can use the measure tool to get some exact distances but based on the scale we had been talking about a hex should be 100-150 km.  Does that make distances make sense?

"Map","Here is another final rev:

http://www.foliage.com/~jaw/History/map.html

I have made the fixes

I did not bother exporting all three views

I was going to export a PDF version (also a vector format) since I figured everybody had PDF viewers and you could use it to zoom.  I don't know how you have been zooming on the jpeg but it is probably pretty bad and may be limiting your ability to review distances.  Anyway the PDF turned out to be 13MB which was ridiculous considering the JPG is about 100K.

BTW:  I have not included the nobby mountain thing NW of Northern Rhelania in the dwarvish region because it seemed isolated.  It didn't seem to be naturally part of anything but I could easily combine it into any of its bordering regions.  The only remaining unnamed areas are the islands south of the rhelanian sea (?) and a few outlying islands.

"Maps","Today I played around a little with printing the maps.  I have a four page print out which I can butt together to form a full D Size map.  I also have a one page print out which covers the area from just below the dwarvish mountains to just above Venn and from Kern to just east of Fire Mountain (the main area play occurs in).  I will bring these to the run on the 24th.

In the mean time I thought I would include a number of distances to check these out (I am hoping they are OK cause I like the map the way it is now).

Assume 1 Hex = 22.5 pts = 150 km

All distances are as the crow flies

Fire Mountain to Kiev = 80 pts = ~600 km = ~360 mi
Fire Mountain to Hiemdella = 175 pts = ~1200 km
= ~720 mi
Fire Mountain to Marden = 205 pts = ~1350 km
= ~810 mi
Marden to Hiemdella = 260 pts = ~1725 km = ~1035 mi
Marden to Gazad-Lah = 190 pts = ~1275 km = ~765 mi
Length of the Kereshay = 260 pts = ~1725 km = ~1035 mi
Marden to Rhelania = 570 pts = ~3900 km = ~2300 mi
Westmost Kern to Eastmost Rhelania = 935 pts = ~6225 km = ~3735 mi
Northmost Dwarven Mountains to Southmost Venn = 1130 pts = ~7535 km = ~4521 mi

Also (not as the crow flies)
Length along the Mogul River from the Bay to Hiemdella = ~200-250 pts = ~1300-1700 km

I did not calculate distances to the North of the Waste since that line is imaginary

It would be nice if we could make any adjustments by adjusting the hex scale.

"Re: Lunch tomorrow to talk about Elven Magic ?","I was thinking about just this sort of thing (the Kilsorana question) when I was wacking together the wizardry pages.

What I was wondering is, is Naming an elvish thing or is it more of a Gray Elvish thing?

If we consider the Golden Ones to be degenerate High Elves did they use Naming or traditional Wizxardries.  I suspect that latter more although there could have been exceptions.

What about Gulliver?  Is he a wizard or a Namer?  Looks like a wizard to me?

High Elves?  Wood Elves?  Sea Elves?  they all seem a little more integrated into the human model.  Do they all have access to both patterns?  Or is it that they have access to either pattern but couldn't really develop both (Naming and Wizardries)?  As a statistical cross section of the magic using population what % of each race are Namers?

I would suspect in decreasing order of commoness it would be
High Elf
Golden One
Sea Elf
Wood Elf

But I don't know if the range is 90%-50% or 20%-0%.

  Kilsorana is a funny thing- she is an exception to the rule.  As are
  BTW, many of the sea-elves.    She has the potential for both but she
  primarily uses what the elves call ""Isolated, Bounded Power Patterns"" 
  (aka ""Human Wizardries"").
  She was taught primarily the ""Alteration"" pattern.  She was taught not
  in the classical Elven manner but rather by an Eldar with a slightly
  skewed relationship to the Prime.  (For one thing he doesn't believe in
  the Prime.  He thinks of it as a mass delusion that is the cause of most
  of the suffering in the world.)

  I am more inclined to call Elven mages ""Namers""  and isolate the pattern
  more.

"Theories about magic","Alex and I were talking about Alteration in the parking lot and trying to determine if my (Kua-Toa) school of alteration differed from the common (Slaad based) school.  I had not thought about this before becuase I did not realize they were different patterns.  This prompted me to expound Jim's theory of how I though of the magics (from the Kua-Toa vs. Slaad perspective) so that Alex can then explain what the case actually is.  So here goes:

1.    Jim's History of Human Magics

Life in the Third Epoch
  a.. Sigmund/Nuryev/... is a Master Drawer.
  b.. Drawing is an Eldar Kua-Toa school created during the 3rd Epoch and was one of the major Kua-Toa wizardries
  c.. Dreaming is an Eldar Slaad school created during the 3rd Epoch and was one of the major Slaad wizardries
  d.. Drawing and Dreaming are violently opposed patterns are war against each other
  e.. Kua-Toa and Slaad are violently opposed races and war against each other
  f.. Members of the Kua-Toa race also studied eldar versions of the Alteration and Summoning schools
  g.. Members of the Slaad race also studied eldar versions of the Alteration and Summoning schools
  h.. My impression was that Kua-Toa Alteration and Slaad Alteration were two (very different) schools of the same pattern
  i.. Similarly with Kua-Toa and Slaad Summoning
  j.. A non-Kua-Toa who learned Drawing would react violently to a non-Slaad who learned Dreaming
  k.. A non-Kua-Toa who learned Kua-Toa Alteration would not react violently to a non-Slaad who learned Dreaming becuase these patterns are not fundamentally opposed (except maybe a culturally aqcuired antipathy)
  l.. Anyone from the current epoch who tried to learn drawing or dreaming would most likely destroy their brain

Life in the Current Epoch
  a.. Conjuration and Evokation are patterns directly constructed by the Kua-Toa based on the drawing pattern which are accessable to the denizens of the fifth epoch.
  b..  Illusion and Enchantment are patterns directly constructed by the Slaad based on the dreaming pattern which are accessable to the denizens of the fifth epoch.
  c.. Abjuration, Divination and Will Working are modern patterns that are based upon both drawing and dreaming.  They were created as seperate efforts with the God-King patterns being more drawing based (I wonder why) and the Golden Ones patterns being more dreaming based.  Over time these schools have merged to form a single pattern although some flavor still remains (prophecy is more dreaming, seeing is more drawing).
  d.. Alteration and Summoning(Greater) are modern versions of the eldar patterns which have been generally made accessable.
  e.. I have not though about the elemental schools at all.  I do not know if they are Kua-Toa, Slaad or none of the above. If I had to guess I would say that they are not Kua-Toa but are made possible by the Kua-Toa patterns, except for life and death which are heavily Slaad influenced and nature and decay which are a big blend.
  f.. Madra came along late in the game and mixed all of the patterns together a little and tended to muddy the waters about their roots.  I am unclear how she and Asmonar relate to each other and the elementals but that is less relevant to this discussion.
Anyway, the whole reason for this was that I see the Alteration and Summoning patterns as being developed and practiced by the Kua-Toa and Slaad but less racially aligned than Drawing and Dreaming.  I see all the Higher Wizardries (other than Alteration and Summoning) as having been derived from either Drawing, Dreaming or Both.  And I don't know about the Elemental Wizardries.

2.    Jim's View on Alteration

We were also talking about how alteration works.  In retrospect I think we were saying a lot of the same things in different ways therefor I think I would list a few of the key aspects of alteration and then we can invent flowery language to express it in the game (my favorite part).
  a.. AN ALTERATIONIST ALTERS THINGS TO A PATTERN - An alterationist does not have to know how something works or what it is made of two shift into it or alter something into it.  The first step in an alteration is to call the pattern of the thing you are altering into.  You do not issue each micro alteration instruction with the risk of screwing up and turning into a dog with a non-functional heart.
  b.. AN ALTERATIONIST ALTERS SUBSTANCE AND FORM BUT NOT WILL.  If I alter myself into a pig I will develop the senses and maybe some of the personality of a pig but I will still BE sigmund (be the same CGB) and I will have my intentions and ""memories"" (this is probably a complex area but hopefully we can just go with it for the common case).  I cannot alter someone to be sad.
  c.. AN ALTERATIONIST ALTERS THE PROPERTIES OF AN OBJECT  - If I alter a lump of gold into a wooden pail and then someone does a detect gold on the area the pail will not show up as gold (or there would be a contest of skills but the default would be to have the label of the new thing).
  d.. AN ALTERATIONIST DOES NOT ALTER THE IDENTITY OF AN OBJECT - If I alter gold into a wooden pail and then wild magic comes into the area there is a chance that the pail will pop back into the lump of gold.  This is becuase the pail is fundamentally a lump of gold in pail form.  It would take, however, a discipline level divination to detect the true identitiness in this respect (or a really cranking roll in the contest of skills for a wizardry based divination).
  e.. AN ALTERATIONIST ALTERS RELATIONSHIPS - From the Kua-Toa perspective an alterationist is altering the consensus relationship properties of a CGB with respect to other CGBs and the ""world"".  As such the things which are altered sometimes transcend the physical.  If a high level alterationist alters into a dwarf they could, as part of the change, alter their native tongue to dwarvish.  If a high level alterationist turns into a fish they could transfer their familiarity with ground based movement to a corresponding skill with water based movement.  (Actually, this may be the difference between Alteration and Ki Factor Shapechange in which case I should rewrite the Alteration advantages a little).
  f.. AN ALTERATION IS ""PERMANENT"" - Once an alteration is made, in the absence of any other magic (as in case 4 above) the thing will stay altered and over time the new pattern will become more and more of the base pattern of the entity till eventually it becomes both permanent and not an alteration.
Beyond this I had a lot of words about fundamental patterns which I think are applicable as long as we agree on the operational definitions.

3.    Jim's History of the World

As long as I am pontificating I thought I would divulge my secret interpretation of the history of the world.  I believe each epoch in history is defined by a fundamental conflict.  This conflict represents, at one level, the stage in the evolution of the universal conciousness.  This conflict also represents the fundamental cause of the major battle which defines the end of the epoch.  One of the things I see about the fundamental conflicts is that even though there was a battle and a presumed winner each of these wars still goes on.  Also, although one side seems to dominate in each case I do not ever see a 100% victory.  As I see it the fundamental conflicts for each epoch are as follows:

Epoch I - Existence vs. Non-Existence
Epoch II - Group vs. Individual
Epoch III - Objective vs. Subjective
Epoch IV - Order vs. Chaos
Epoch V - ?Life vs. Death?

In more detail:

Epoch I - Existence vs. Non-Existence
  The being awakes.  There is I. Should conciousness maintain itself or should it disappear only to reappear the next moment unaware that it has ever been before.  Such a state could go on forever or it could end and identity could be established.  The sides are basically those who support there being something and those who believe there should be nothing.
  As I see it the somethings won and what came out of this conflict is the concept of context generating beingness.
  This is the age of the elements.
Epoch II - Group vs. Individual

  Now awake the question is am I one entity or am I multiple entities each with a unique viewpoint.  The battle of the hive mind over the individual mind.  I see the concept of divinity coming forward as a distinction in this epoch (am I acting as the whole or as a part).

  As I see it the individuals won (although the divine uber-entities still exist)
  This is the age of the insect.  This is also the age of Sorceries.

Epoch III - Objective vs. Subjective

  Now a series of individuals the question is ""is there anything besides us?""  I see the Kua-Toa supporting a universe in which we live in an external objective framework.  I see the Slaad supporting a universe in which there is nothing real but ourselves and consensus between us is transitory and ephemeral at best.  I see the objective crowd supporting a material world with causal order and persistence.  I see the subjective crowd supporting a dream world in which all things external to us are just expressions ourselves at the current moment and there is no persistence of anything but self.

  As I see it the objectivists won (although we do still dream)

  This is the age of the Slaad and Kua-Toa. This is also the age of Wizardries.

Epoch IV - Order vs. Chaos

At this point I start becoming less in tune with the progress along the path of conciousness.  Having settled on a host of individuals in a persitant and causal universe I see the conflict becoming abstract.  It seems like the fourth Epoch resolves around the Dau-Penn/Kisreth.  This division is most commonly referred to as order vs. chaos but I do not see this as a stage in evolution.  It is more a moral dilemna.  Perhaps the question is more difficult to pin down like Morals or no Morals.  I tend to think it is more metaphysical than ethical.  I will think about this more.

Perhaps I Dau-Penn and Kisreth hate each other but were both on the same team.  After all it would be hard to say one won over the other.

Epoch V - ?Life vs. Death?

As far as the current epoch this is even harder.  It seems that the biggest conflicts here revolve around life vs. death but this could be a thin mask over the whole prime vs. non-prime battle.

Anyway, perhaps I delve to deep.  Time to return to work.

  As to method of egress I would suggest that Mordanith
  teleporting out is a bad idea. The two elves can pattern
  out but it will take a quickstrike enforce reality
  to make it happen. Any other suggestions are welcome.

  As for Kilsorana being an Elfy type I have always maintained
  your pedigree to be one of the highest. Your name, as simple

  that Correlan's voice through you must ring as a

"Re: Shapeshifters","Jim and I were discussing ways to get out and we came up with a great solution. Catapult!  We can just fling ourselves through the air and land with a crashing thump in the middle of Marden.

But seriously.  Given my current state I would suggest we go with a more physical approach like high speed levitation or maybe an air bubble rather than turning into air for me (I don't know how easy it is for a Fortu to become airy).  Perhaps everybody else could do the air thing and the Fortu could hop a ride on the back fo Sleppnir.  How fast does she go? Another possibility besides air form is light form (as Gulliver did when he dropped by - also probably not easy for Fortu).  

Another more boring possibility is carpet to Kiev (or one of the nearby Dao-Shoa cities and Library it from there).  According to the map Techen (the closest city) is about 100-150 miles away (150-225 km).  How fast does a carpet go?  Could we make it there in under 3 hours (50mph)?  What would we have to dodge along the way?

BTW:  Speaking of the map Alex, where is the city of Usil?  I assume it is near fire mountain.

"Map","I have updated the map on the server in two ways:

I added Usul's City (currently called Usul's City becuase I don't recall its other name).

I have added eps and dxf versions of the files.  Rather than mailing around large files I have just put them on the http server with links to them.  I was trying to use ftp: links but for some stupid reason it was not working (brain farts) and so they are http: links.  This should not be a big deal unless you happen to have an inline image viewer defined for these formats in which case I suppose you can still save it to the local disk.

Anyway, they are there.  I am not sure how the DXF turned out.  I did check that it was viewable but I am not sure whether or not the coastline needs to be manually rejoined.  In any case if you have eps viewers you should be all set.

the URLs for my BT pages are:
http://www.foliage.com/~jaw/Wizardries/
http://www.foliage.com/~jaw/History/

the map is off the second site.

BTW:  Alex, can I get links to these sites off of your BT web pages just so we can start being connected (the BT gaming ring).  I already refer back to your site in several places.

  First of all, thanks for an exciting non-combat run, even if it
  left me having to explain how we ""kicked butt"" when all we did was
  make plans and have dinner.


  Alex, Lara provided a date of ""May first"" for our time stamp.
  Counting little boxes on my calendar left me with 'Day 121' in the
  format I had been using.  Is either of those formats likely to
  dominate in the future?  And is the conversion between them easy
  to explain?  With more party time spent visiting those poor
  benighted Feudal types, this may be a source of unneeded confusion
  later on.


  Also, is it too early to start looking for another run date?  I
  know my February is booking fast, and I wouldn't mind reserving a
  spot now.  Alex, since your presence is most vital to the run,
  could you post a list of either good or bad dates for the rest of
  us to work on?

  Also, the party was left in a divided state, with several days of
  stuff to work through.  I would like a solo run in there somewhere
  (perhaps a weeknight, for 2-3 hours?) and I suspect others might
  as well.  If this works for you, perhaps you could discuss those
  days as well.

"Re: Run dates and otherwise","I was about to berate alex for changing the number of days in a month from 30 to 28 when I looked at my own notes and lo and behold I had 28 days written down all along.  The calendar web page I have does not mention the summer and winter festival weeks though.  An interesting note about these. The month is an integral moon cycle for both the Dragon and the Messanger.  What this meant was that the 1st of the month was always the same phase of the moon for all months for all of history.  Adding the festival weeks (assuming 7days and 7 days) means that the phase on the 1st for the messenger is still always the same, the dragon will change phase by a quarter cycle every festival returning to the original phase every two years.  If the winter festival is six days then the messenger cycles through a seven year phase shift and the dragon cycles through a 28 year cycle.  If the astrologers are choosing between six and seven because it is a non-integral multiple then who knows what the cycle time is.  Of course in this magical world who is to say that the phase shift is a constant.  Perhaps it all depends on how the dragon is feeling that decade.

  Well, I talked to Alex and got answers for the in-game calendar stuff.
   
  All months are 28 days long.  In addition, there are two inter-calendral festival weeks, not counted on the 'official' record, at the summer and winter solstice.  These are six or seven days, the exact number chosen by local wizards or astrologers.  I'm assuming (for ease of calculation) that the summer week is always seven days and they mess with the winter week, letting us not worry about the leap year when counting days.
   
  Using this, May 1st = 5/1 = (5-1)*28 +1 = 113

  The year as such would be 12*28 +13 = 350 days long (max), making it about 5% shorter than ours.  Thus a BT 20-year-old would look 19 to us, and a 40-year-old would look 28.  I can live with that.   (Also, Alex, if you want to mess with the length of the days, making them, say, around 5% longer, you can do that, too.)
   
  The other interesting date (well, to me) would be Eman's birthday, on Day 299.  
   
  299 = 10*28 +19 = (11-1) +7(summer week) +12 = November 12th.  (Hey!  He's a Scorpio!)
   
  ...And I like the seasonality, too.

"Gaming Stuff","I was wondering if you had finished compiling your list of verbs for elven wizardries.  When I was talking with Alex yesterday, in between the sagas of our lives we did discuss a little gaming and one of the things that came up is that Sigmund most likely has an elvish wizardry.  I say most likely because we are both reserving judgement until we decide what that actually means.

What I envision is that Sigmund's geomantic skills are actually elven in training.  Yea, you remember, those huge hoardes of elvish geomancers that you see on every street corner.  Well, OK it is a bit obscure but it definately exists and is actually fairly common amongst (your gonna love this) the Na-Kor.

Anyway, the question I am pondering at the moment is whether this school would potentialy be a human look-alike school that operates the way human wizardries do but is merely elven in falvor.  I get the impression that this model exists quite a bit amongst the elves highly tuned to the prime (wood, sea,..., probably Na-Kor).  The other alternative is that it follows more of the Naming style but it happens that all my knowedge and focus are on geomancy and crystals.  It would be easier to decide which was appropriate if I knew more about the Naming stuff you had worked up already.

Have you thought about this much since the last run?

"Elvish Magic","Jim - I CC'd you to promote feedback but do not panic if what I say is different than were you were going.  I am just playing and I acknowedge that it is your sandbox.

I just had a long discussion with Jim about what elvish magic is all about and I came to the conclusion that I will have to have my own internal view if I want to make any sense about anything.  Out of our discussion I did glean the following things:

All great inventions throughout history were actually made by elves even if later attributed to other people.
High Elves can choose whether to use the Order/Chaos based patterns or to use 'Naming'
Gray Elves have no choice and must use 'Naming'
'Naming' essentially means playing with other peoples toys.  As in naming is a way to deal with other power patterns (Kua-Toa/Slaad and possibly Draconic according to him) and produce effects.  Elvish magic by itself NEVER produces any effects except at the discipline level.
Elvish magic never persists outside of the Aura/Concentration of the caster unless it is supported by someone else.
Elves alter reality easier than sneezing but it does not last as described above.

This view of elven magic was not particularly useful to me.  It does not really give any unique character to elven magic at all.  As such I came up with the following alternate viewpoint which I believe encompasses the same set of facts.

[SLIGHT ASIDE] Before starting into that I thought I should mention something about the word pattern.  It seems to figure heavily into Jim's concept of elven magic.  I would assert that wizardry patterns refer to Kua-Toa created.  Specifically all of the human wizardries are called power patterns becuase they have some aspect of Order magic in them (even Illusion which is why humans do not go insane casting it - although the order magic here is probably the slimmest of frameworks).  As far as the other types of magic I would say that Dreaming does not really fit the word pattern, it is a fundamentally different thing.  Where Slaad influences have appeared in the human wizardries it is like a mold or a virus or a taint on the underlying Ordered framework and in the case of Illusion the infection is bigger than the thing it infects.  In a similar sense I would say that Draconic magic is so fundamentally different than Order magic that a pure draconic archetype would never be described as a pattern (although there may be achetypical patterns or archetypical patterners as well as infected archetypes and archetypical infections).  What I am trying to do is establish the fundamental difference between the types of magic.

Having said all of that let us return to elvish magic:

My impression of elivsh magic from the way that it has occured in the world is that it deals with anima. (Kua-Toa=Objective World, Slaad=Dream, Dragon=Archetype, Elf=Anima).  As such an elvish approach to magic would be to treat everything in the world as an animate entity and interact with it appropriately.  Sing to the trees and ask them to grow a certain way.  Sing to the crystals and ask them to grow a certain way.  Talk to the stars and ask them for prophecies. etc.

Where does Jim and Naming fit into this.  My contention is that Mordenaith is not a generalist elven mage but in fact an extreme specialist.  He specializes in talking with human wizardry patterns and asking them to do things for him.  In doing this he has developed the whole specialized vocabulary of naming and tweaking patterns and verbs, etc.  In fact a true generalist elven mage would talk to anything.  Why ask the geomatic pattern to make a wall when you can just ask the earth to rise up and form itself into a wall?  The reason is that since Mordenaith specializes he is MUCH more fluent in the language and interactions of patterns, they are pretty powerful and talking to the earth is probably slower and more likely to give you lip about doing stuff.  I would suspect that most elven mages specialize not becuase the fundamental actions are different but because it is important to know the specific thing you are talking to VERY well.  As a special case of this elvish enchantment is probably not ussualyy done by talking the the enchantment pattern but ussually done by talking to humans and having a (strangely elvish in viewpoint) knowledge of human interactions.

As such I would propose that an elvish mage would have skills like the following:
A W:skill in the voice being used (for Jim power patterns may be one voice, for an earthsinger earth might be a voice)
A lore skill (G: or not?)  in each kind of thing being talked to (for Jim each power pattern e.g. Levator, for an earthsinger each kind of earth.  I plan on Stone, Metal, Crystal and Earth(i.e.Dirt)).
A variety of interaction within that voice (for jim the set of verbs, for an earth singer another set of verbs like grow, animate, take the form of, have the senses of, ...)

The verbs are the part I am least sure about becuase I am not sure I have distinguished between them and the sorceries.

In this way Sigmund would be an EarthSinger in the same way that Mordenaith is a Namer and they would both be elven magics.  As a side note I do not see elven magics as having a pattern anymore than draconic or slaad magic.  What would it have?  Community is the wrong word.  I will have to think about that.  For the moment lets call it a spiritview (please replace this term).  

It is interesting to think then:  Mordenaith deals with the spiritview of patterns, is there a pattern for spiritviewing (healing or necromancy?), can you have a tainted spritiview or an archetypical spiritview?  Does an archetype have a spirit (independant of its Avatars?).

  Well I definitely don't agree with the skill set. 
   
  Mordanith probably has 
   
  Discipline: Naming (Aka interact assertions with animate reality)
  G:Abjuration Power Pattern 
  Spell (really a kata of naming assertions and sorcerous actions):Ward

Just out of curiosity if a spell is a Kata do you have skill also in the atomic actions of which the kata is composed.  For example WamBamBoom is a kata composed of two sword techniques, 3 power sorceries, an accelerate, a manuever and enforce reality.  As such I have skill in each of those individual actions as well as the kata itself.  I am sure you have sorcery skills up the yin-yang but do you also plan to take skill in specific naming-assertions?
   
  To cast Mordanith would use naming (there is no activation involved), use G:Abjuration power pattern as a 
  general, and run though the kata. 
    
  I actually expect that while Mordanith has specialized in Wizardry Power Patterns he has some skill in other patterns such as dreamwalking and
  _The Pattern_. 

I am still a little unclear how dreamwalking (which is in essence the antithesis of pattern) can have a pattern though I can easily see how this could relate to _The Pattern_(tm).
   
  Nuff'Said

  Agreed.

"Elven Magic","New strategy.  Rather than think about how elvish magic would work let me state what I would desire out of Sigmund's elvish magic skills.

1.    My elvish magics ought to be completely different in character from my other magics.  Currently Sigmund has one Magic area in three of the four types of magic.  

For Kua-Toa magic he has a Drawing wizardry with the corresponding Kua-Toa discipline skills.  For Draconic magic he is a priest/avatar of the Fortu racial archetype.  For Slaad magic he is a dreamwalker and has various skills in calling from and manipulating the dream.  Each of these skills are so completely different from the others that there really is no comparison.  Trying to use a single word like magic to cover all three would really be a stretch.  

I am sure there are examples of each of these kinds of magic that are much closer to each other.  For example the Tharuden Royal College of Will Working (Kua-Toa) and the Rhellenian Will Working School (Slaad) are very similar and I am sure there is some draconicly influenced 'Wizardry like' thing which is very similar.  The point is that whether or not these things exist Sigmund does not have these kinds of skills.  Sigmund tends to learn things at their core.  One might say that the colleges mentioned above are all human schools and hence are closer becuase the human outlook has blended them and none of them are pure.  It is my contention (completely unsupported by anything so crass as facts or consensus opinions) that in their pure forms each of these three types of magic have nothing in common at all and that there pure forms are never seen in the world today.  Sigmund tries to study each of these magics as close to the pure form as possible.

OK, those last two paragraphs were getting a bit to pretentious.  The point is that, to be honest, the only reason I am interested in studying elvish magic is to be the first on my block to collect all four.  And the only reason that appeals to me is that I currently perceive each of the four types of magic as having a complely different and independant character.  So, as far as the way they work for Sigmund, I would like each of them to operate in a completely different manner.  It does not matter to me if other people in the world use them in ways that minimize their differences, I just want to be able to use them in ways that maximize their differences.

2.    Here are the things which I would like to do with an elvish based geomantic magic.  For the sake of convenience I am going to call this EarthSinging but I am not attached to any particular meta-physics or skill set (he claims naively).

General things to be manipulated:  Crystals, Stone, Metals

Spells/Abilities/Verb Combinations/whatever
  a.. Grow (Shape) Crystals - This could be used for growing specialized crystals for use in all sorts of things.  It could also be used to create a crystal forest or to coat something (like a rod) with crystals all over it by coaxing them to grow on it.
  b.. Grow (Shape) Stone - This could be used to grow stone into a specific shape.  Especially useful for growing tall sinous towers or curving walls and domes.  You could use this to stoneshape a whole in a wall but it would be slow.  You might as well use the sorcery for that. 
  c.. Grow (Shape) Metal - This could be used to weave the garins of a metal in just the right way to make an excellant sword blade.
  d.. EarthWalk/Stone Form - Is this a sorcery or an EarthSinging thing?  Take the form of earth and move through the earth easily.
  e.. Awaken Memory Crystal - Take a specially grown crystal and awaken the earthspirit inside it to take on a new level of conciousness thereby making it really useful for programming tasks or building net server nodes.
  f.. Awaken Haalite Crystal - (I know that Chris already knows how to make Haalite so this may be impossible) - Take a specially grown crystal and awaken the earthspirit inside it to take on a new level of conciousness thereby making it really useful for supporting someone elses reality.
  g.. Animate Metal - Take a metal earthspirit and give it the power to control its shape and form easily.  This could be used in a spell to allow metal wire to come to life and wrap around someone and it could be used in the long term to make a morphing weapon like the multi-blade.
  h.. Animate Stone - Same concept but with stone.  Good for short term golems and earths hands in the short term.  Great for making those entrance ways that look like a giant mouth in the long term.
  i.. Commune w/ Earth - Once again Sorcery or Ability?  All I know is that the earth is everywhere and if you have the patience to talk to it the stories it could tell.  Where is my enemy?  How do I sneak into the castle?  5000 years ago who was at the battle on this plain?
  j.. Summon Stone Elemental - Sure everything in the earth has a spiriti but some of them are clearly bigger than others.  Get me one of the biggies that is self animate to pummel my enemies or tote my bails.  Do I need a seperate skill to Enchant the elemental once I have summoned it?
  k.. Create Warders - It strikes me that earth and order are linked.  This ability would take a set of earth spirits and dedicate them to enforcing the reality in an area.  It might be a specific reality or they may just be insuring that the conversation changes slowly.  This might be a real bummer for any chaos magic in the area or even any magic at all.
I am not sure how all of these would relate to the earth sorceries?  I figure S:Commune w/ Earth and S:Earth Form would still be good though they would cover the basic voice and form whereas their earthsinger counterparts would be much more persuasive/mobile.  I figure S:Summon Earth is way different than summon elemental but really important for those low earth environments (got to get the earthspirits there first befoer you can talk to them).  Grow would be enhanced versions of this.  I would think EarthShape and EarthBind would be considered crass by Earthsingers (why push when you can ask) but might still be good backup skills or perhaps the fast way of doing it and its OK if you apologize afterwards.

I do not see EarthSinging as fast and more involved with creating things (specialized earth spirits) than performing effects.

I suppose in the long term there might be interesting things to explore in terms of Dirt (Earth+Nature) and Magma (Earth+Fire) but for now this is my focus.
 
OK, thats it.  What do you guys think?

"Random Gaming Blurb","One of the things that happened this weekend was I had a short discussion with Alex about the fact that there is no foolproof way to teleport.  The safest plan Alex could come up with was:  when you get to be rank 16 in teleport like Falstaff and are as deadly maybe then you can teleport with impunity, maybe.

Rather than get all bummed out and never go anywhere again I figured why not look on the bright side and explore what the advantages and disadvantages of my other form of fast transport (shifting through the net) are.

What is the net (in sigmunds opinion)
The net is a tightly woven web/fabric of tendrils which permeates all of reality (realities).  It is composed (much as the internet is) of a bunch of disparate subnets which have been glued together.  Many of the networks in the world are probably aspects of the net seen through specific world views and many of the parts of the net has acquired the flavor of its most frequent users.  Some subparts of the net which I have travelled across include the Halls of the Dead, the Golden Empire Network, the Tarrantyl (sp?) Pattern and the Liche's Network.

How do I travel through the net (in sigmunds opinion)
I cast a spell to move to a reality in which the lines of the net are a physical place and then I walk along them until I come to a part of the net near the reality I want to be at.  Then I cast another spell to move back to the reality I wanted to be at.  While I am in the net I can look out (using a special variant of the 'See Planes' sorcery) at the reality supported by the part of the net I am in.

What is it like to travel through the net
For me I see the net in one of two modes:  

In physical mode I see the net as large tunnels with  milky gray walls of an unknown substance.  The tunnels are about the size of a subway tunnel and can junction off in any direction including up or down.  Any entity can use whatever form of locamotion is natural to them (so Kilsorana can swim next to me walking).  It is VERY VERY tangled and easy to get lost in which is VERY deadly since some passages mysteriously empty into the void with no warning.  While in the net there is no access to any of the wizardric patterns or any divine entity unless that pattern/entity is manifested inside of you (which apparently starts at Rank 10 and the amount you can do when isolated grows slowly with each rank after that).  Areas that are tainted or are part of a subnet may have a different character.  The halls of the dead appear to me to be very blocky square stone tunnels.

In data mode I am a little data packet zipping along a packet switched network with a bunch of other little data packets.  Same network, different viewpoint.

What are the Advantages of travelling through the Net
  a.. The net goes everywhere.  In sigmunds opinion the net is fundamental to reality and there can not be a place that is not touched by the net.  I have found two places (Fire Mountain and The Sea Elven City) which did have networks but the networks were isolated from everywhere else's net.
  b.. I cannot be teleportal trapped stepping into or out of the net.
  c.. When I get to where I want to go, just before stepping out I can look at what is there in case it is ten trolls with jack hammers.
  d.. My buddy Big Brother is there.
What are the Disadvantages of travelling through the Net
  a.. It is not instantaneous.  I travel through the net at an effective rate of 100 times what it would take me to walk there.  In actually I am travelling much faster but there are no direct paths in the net so likely I will go from Marden to Hiendella via the Abyss, Fairy, Rhellania and the Marianas Trench (or equivalent).  For me this roughly translates to about 1000 mph since I am a fast walker.  But that still means it is an hour plus to get anywhere.  Not that I am complaining, that is much faster than walking.  When we had the golem along this got much slower although I am not aware of anything that would prevent me from bringing a horse (besides the fact that I can't ride).
  b.. It is VERY dangerous if you do not know where you are going since a wrong turn can kill you.
  c.. You get random encounters.  We met a few necromancers, some Terethi, a priest of Loki and a golem on my last jaunt.  Furthermore when you meet people there they are ussually not your average farmer.  I would say that scale is way tilted towards vampire level encounters.
  d.. If you are going near Bengali you will run into Liche tainted parts of the net which are not safe.
  e.. If you travel with me and I get killed it is very hard for anyone else to get out of the net.  There are doors which require no special spells to use but they are few and far between.  You would have to be a rank 10+ conjurer to even think of teleporting out and I don't know what that would do.  I am not sure what it would be like to plane shift or plane step out but I suspect it would be a desparation measure only.
Thats all I can think but after listing all that I can see why I would rather walk than teleport.  I am not sure how shifting through the net compares to walking the pattern (which also seems faster) but apparently there is an issue about where you can walk to.

I also would say that the comparison with dream walking would be that dream walking would be much faster, just as silent if not more so, more dangerous in terms of random encounters along the way and FAR more dangerous in terms of possibly accidently getting lost in an isolated reality and never getting back to the consensus.  Needless to say I do not use dreamwalking for casual transportation.

Actually for casual transportation it is probably safest to take a Ghurka.

First of all, can I say that I am so psyched that our teleport was hijacked
by an evil baddy and we have been catapulted into the distant past.

Having said that I thought it would be worthwhile to list our assets:

1.    No hurricane cloaks
2.    No plane of neutrality and as far as I can tell the whole concept of
planes is missing.  Impact:  No teleports, plane shifts, plane sight and
transverse does not work for Fortu.
3.    No net and no big brother.
4.    If we are correct about the late epoch 3ness of our time then no
concept of divinity and no later wizardric patterns.  W:Drawing,
dreamwalking and sorceries seem to be fine.  I am thinking that this may be
the same as trying to use wizardries inside the net in which case if you are
rank 10+ in a W: (not a G:) you have enough of the pattern in you to be able
to use it.  Thus Kilsorana could use alteration and Mordenaith could use
Naming (although with all of the other patterns gone I am not sure what
there might be to manipulate).

On a related note since Khalid is the key to air and fire does that mean
that W:Air and W:Fire are present when he is around?  What about the orb of
souls, does that manifest the necromantic pattern?

On the divine front I think Odin is strong enough to manifest here and
though the Archetypal Fortu is not at the moment he might be once I make a
few ep rolls.  Also D'Jan might be able to help focus these things.

Unfortunately this all assumes my 10+ assumption is correct which I do not
know.
5.    Whacking people on the head might still be a good idea although I get
the feeling it will be less powerful here (since magery is less restricted).
6.    Since most of us who have disciplines have studied Kua-Toa disciplines
they are probably of use here.  Also I have a sneaking suspicion that the
kickback percentage is less since the universe is probably less ordered.

In summary I think for most people we should stick to:
Sorceries
Disciplines
Things you are 10+ in (maybe)

For a fair while, I've had problems with Alex's names for the various
degrees of spell-casting (Workings, Rites, etc).

Updating Eman's sheet, I was inspired with a possible re-naming.

To wit:

Cantrips (barely more than sorceries)
  1 caster, can have components, done in seconds
  ex-- ""Air Lance"", ""Chill Beverage"", ""Dry Clean Outfit""

Spells (more complex, using one or more sorceries)
  Usually 1 caster, often components, done in minutes
  ex-- ""Rebuild to Pattern"", ""Regenerate Limb"", ""Summon Elemental""

Workings (using one or more spells)
  1 or more casters, usually ingredients and diagrams, done in hours
  ex-- ""Bind Air Elemental to Weaving"", ""Find Familiar"", ""Spell Trigger""

Rites (time and power-consuming, more complex)
  Several casters, ingredients and diagrams, takes hours to days
  Timing is often a factor
  ex-- ""Time Hammer"", ""Establish Gate"", ""Summon Vordack""

Rituals (the big guns, very complex and difficult)
  Multiple casters, ingredients and diagrams, hours to days
  Timing is always a factor; may not work at all without right
conditions
  ex-- ""Isolation Ward for Heartstone"", ""Return to Epoch Five""

Eman's items (cloak, suit, scarf) have embedded elementals in them.
They should be fine.  (Elementals may not exist yet, but neither do we.
As long as they brought their context, I think they're okay.)  This
would also include everyone's ironcloth (unless it was already broken--
sorry, Kheldar.)  Less sure about the Wizard's Guild ring, though, but
with no wizards to contact, or other planes to go to, it's pretty much a
moot point.

I think ""Dorian Trained"" is about to come into its own as an advantage,
though.

    Based on conversations that Jim and I had on the way home last night
we think that we should do the following:

    1. Attempt to use Drawing to hide our ""packet"" emissions.
    2. Walk out in a tight group directly past an ""toads"" and change our
direction if it looks like we will cross paths with one.
    3. Move as far away from ANY entity that we possibly can.
    4. Although we think that Dau Pen would treat us better than Dof
Sifrin or Corellan, it is probably best to avoid any entities since
their outlook now is radically different from what it will be in the
future.  The only possible exceptions to this are likely to be whatever
corresponds to the Kerestaen or the Fates in this reality.
    5. When we get to an isolated spot experiment as much as possible
(without contacting other entities).  Determine when we are, what the
structure of reality is, magical rules, discipline rules.
    6. See if we can come up with a plan to get back
    7. If not, find a place to dig in and prepare to hold our own till
the next major reality disruption gives us the chance to try again.

    Britt's comment about magic items is a good point.  Based on the
Laws of Bound power in our old reality, I would expect that we would
have problems.  We aren't in our old reality, however, and that means
that the old Laws aren't necessarily in effect.  I brought 5 Comm Globes
with me.  Once I determined that I could shield myself magically I
decided to bring them along to be used in a spider trap plan that I had.
We shouldn't count on them, though, until we know what affect they have
here.  Will they act as beacons, if they work at all?

    What I really want to do is plan another run date ASAP.   Let's use
the leftover dates from the last scheduling round as a starting point.

        In retrospect it would have been REALLY useful to have brought
the necklace with madras wizardry patterns in them but I had no way of
knowing that and I specifically did not bring it since I wanted to be
low profile.  Some of my stuff is adamantium but I assume that was
around at this point.

            Oh yeah, I think I have a few net-comm globes as well.
These should actually work.  I forgot, even though there is no big
brother the network should still exist at this point.  It may not be as
well integrated and may also be a friggin war zone but the Kua-Toa
started building it very early.  On the other hand it probably does not
extend into the locale we are in since this is still Slaad occupied
space.  I am not sure.  Once we get out of here I should try net
connecting again.

            Well,
            Do you really have all your magic items?  I was actually
wondering exactly
            how many of them survived the transition.  If the wizardries
they are based
            on don't exist, will any of our magic item still function?

            I'm assuming my power enchancer is OK because it was made by
the Kao-tao,
            but even that may have a radically different function in
this epoch than it
            did in ours, after all it has been through numerous reality
changes to
            become what it is now.

            We might want to ask Alex, what items survived.

2. I think that there will be a lot more talking as a group before the
experimentation phase.  Erithmaeon, for instance, was not previously
aware of your Epoch Three or Four existence, and is missing huge chunks
of information about the Epoch Five stuff.  He might insist on getting
that cleared up before moving forward with your knowledge of the period.
Khalid might want a better grasp of historical perspective.  We probably
want a list of who's here (some really old gods) and who's not (almost
everyone else).

    Sounds good to me.

    I have no idea who the fates are but the Keristaen are a group of
rogue Kua-Toa who are staying outside of the epoch 5 prime consensus in
order to better guide it.

    Based on the fact that our mission appears to be move to a safer
location and then experiment I was wondering if we could do the moving
part in a weeknight run.  That way the experimentiung can be done with
subgroups more effectively.  Wat do people think of that?

"RE: Let's do the time warp again ...","Whoa!

Serious philosophizing there, and about two levels deeper than I usually
deal with BT Reality.


My understanding is as follows:

As an epoch becomes unstable, either through catastrophe or too many
incremental changes, it is ""closed out"" and a new Reality, more in line
with the current consensus, forms.  Many people are unformed in the
process, unable to let go of the old rules.  Many others die or go
insane in the new world, unable to adjust to the new rules.  Others
adapt, and survive, either by reformatting, or by supreme acts of will
(Gods, Dragons, and the like.)

Travel to previous epochs is not 'possible', because the
epoch-transition point is a massive rules-change, and whatever rules you
are using to power your travel (or divination) don't apply on the other
side.  Travel forward -is- possible, and at one point everyone in the
world does it.   It is not -safe-, however, as you usually have to face
the same hazards as everyone else.


Now, the theories:

We did not 'travel back' to a previous epoch.  We interfered with an
attempt to 'bring forward' a piece of a previous epoch, set up by person
or persons unknown.  (Epoch 3 persons would make the most sense to me,
but between epoch-travel, Line and Dream magics, and Discipline II
stuff, I'll admit I'm over my head.)  We broke the device they were
using, and were 'pulled back' in the resultant confusion.

Getting home is possible (after all, everyone here eventually gets to
the Epoch transition, right?)  I am unsure if simply entering
epoch-transition would take us to Epoch 4 (the new consensus reality) or
Epoch 5 (the consensus reality best fitting us).  Or maybe we wander
around in inter-Reality space, looking for the way home.

                                             -Myth, now feeling
cheerful.

Subject: Let's do the time warp again ...


    I've been giving the situation a considerable amount of thought.
With regards to running the other groups (and determining the actions of
the NPC's) I'd like to present you with some possibilities.  I'm also
confused about the concept of ""different realities"".

    I thought that you had said that although there might be other
realities populated by other Wills, their reality would be so alien to
ours that there could never be crossover because neither of us could
conceive of the other.  I'm fairly certain that I must have that wrong
because of what happened in the last run, as well as the whole Star Trek
bug incursion.

    With regards to issue of where/when we are, there are three
possibilities that I can think of.  The first is that temporally we are
in the same ""time"" as we were before I blew us up but we are in a
reality formed around the Wills of the Slaad that ""ceased to exist"" in
the Epoch 3 transition.

    It came to me that in each Epoch transition we have talked about
massive deaths occurring among the ""children"" of the Elder Gods.
Assuming that the whole multi-Epoch ""Elder Gods"" concept isn't a recent
reality creation, I would expect that in most of those cases the Elder
Gods deliberately re-absorbed the wills of those who ""didn't make it"" so
that they could have more energy for the next phase.

    But it is entirely possible that many of those Wills simply couldn't
make the paradigm shift to the new reality of the consensus.  If that is
the case it would have created a splinter (pocket) reality where they
continued to exist as they had before.  I believe that this explanation
is not where/when we are, but rather the description of the source of
the recent incursion.

    The second possibility is that we are in a different phase (time) of
""our"" reality.  This seems highly unlikely since it has been made quite
clear that there is sufficient difference between Epoch 5, Epoch 4, and
Epoch 3, that there is no way to ""shift phase"" to the earlier ""time"".

    What intrigues me, though, is a contemplation of time travel as it
relates to reality in your world.  After multiple conversations I think
that most of us are pretty clear that the ""reality"" around us is an
agreement, a ""consensus"", between all of the Wills that make up that
consensus.  And that ""time"" is a way of grouping interactions between
those Wills in a sequential fashion.  Since the reality of ""now"" is no
more than the consensus agrees it to be, if the consensus supports the
""rule"" of time travel and the mutability of ""events"", then it must also
agree to change the parameters of ""now"" if the parameters of the ""past""
are changed.

    We have discussed what happens to a ""weak"" Will if the ""body"" dies
(usually absorbed by a ""god"").  We have discussed what the agreement
says happens when an entity has been Be Not'd - although I don't believe
that I have ever seen or discussed a quantitative analysis of what
happens to the Will in a Be Not situation.  We have touched on the
practice of the Gods of ""seeding"" the world with ""young"" Wills and then
""harvesting"" experienced Wills at the end of their life span.  Given the
""reality"" of ""time"" travel, and the ability to interact with someone who
is ""currently"" ""dead"", there *must* be continuity of Will on an ""entity""
basis.  We have discussed that Greater Gods don't have the ability to
create individual Wills (instead influencing the ""Overmind"" to do so).

    I wonder, though, what is actually happening when the ""overmind""
creates a being.  And does ANY entity have the power to uncreate a
being?  If an entity is Be Not'd, has it been ""destroyed""?  Or is that
the consensus has merely been persuaded that the entity does not exist
and therefore it has been excluded from the consensus; shunned/ignored.
Yet if there is some continuity of Will through different entities, and
one of those entities is Be Not'd, the Will which made up the Be Not'd
entity was another entity ""before"" and another entity ""after"".  What
happened to the Will in between?

    Ok, so maybe I've made a few points, but where am I going with this?

    The use of the word ""Epoch"" is deceptive.  In a ""world"" where time
travel exists, but only as a ""dimension"" of the mind, Epoch implies
""time"".  We're told that the reality difference prevents time travel
between Epoch's.  Yet, given the parameters that I discussed earlier, a
Will which exists in more than one time is still the same Will.

    Doesn't this imply that a Will that exists in more than one Epoch is
still the same Will?  And if it is, does that not imply that, at the
very least, those Wills which exist in more than one Epoch should be
able to ""shift their mental focus"" (move) between those Epoch's?  I
think that it does.  But if you want to move from one Epoch to another,
time travel isn't going to get you there.  That would be like trying to
take a plane to get to the moon.  You need to use a different method.

    I think that the entities that are aware of how to move from one
Epoch to another a) for some reason don't want to make reverse
transitions and b) don't want others to make reverse transitions.  One
reason might be related to a consensus version of ""Entropy"".  Entities
that travel in time take their ""power"" with them.  This is fine because
time is a consensus ""illusion"".  But entities that translate to the
previous Epoch may be ""leaving something behind"".  All entities know
what the world has history even if they don't know the ""history of the
world"".  Yet how many entities have any idea about the Epoch's?  We've
been lead to believe that that number is extremely low.

    If that is the case, then the consensus does not support Epoch
translations - in either direction.  So not only is it more difficult to
make the transition (because you aren't getting help from the
consensus), any power that you control  which is actually group driven
(Wizardry, Divine Magic, and most Gift Magic; possibly Alchemy,
Thaumaturgy, Natural Magics, Craft Magics, Incarnate Magic - even the
Laws of Magic themselves) might be limited or non-existent.

    Further, causality is also a consensus effect.  Thus, if there is no
awareness of other Epochs, then there will be no change to the
parameters of Epoch 5 if the parameters of Epoch 4 are changed.  Put
another way, there will be no change to the parameters of Epoch Blue if
the parameters of Epoch Yellow are changed.  That means that unless
Kheldar enrolls a significant portion of this reality, Kheldar can not
affect the Epoch 5 reality at all.  Nor can we ride out the end of Epoch
3 to 4 or 4 to 5.  If we are in Epoch 3 then we will be trying to
survive Epoch 3 until WE make the transition to another reality.

    From a strictly character oriented framework, if what I've
postulated were actually the case then only minor skills learned in this
Epoch would translate back with us.  And only because our characters
would seed the consensus of Epoch 5 with the knowledge that we had
gained in skills.

    On the other hand, transition from one Epoch to another is likely to
have its advantages for us, too.  From what I've said above, it must
require a method different from ""Temporal Magic"".  And since the
occurrence of Epoch travel is extremely rare, it implies that there are
no fixed parameters regarding the effects of Epoch travel.  It is
probably a lot like the space travel in ""Hitchhikers Guide to the
Galaxy"".  In fact, Alex set me on this track when he talked about the
Slaad Conjuration Gateway.  He said something about anything in the gate
being 50% probable.

    If we are able to return to Epoch 5, using some form of ""probability
travel"", and we prep ourselves for the instant of transition, then we
may be able to ""create"" or alter something about ourselves or the
reality of Epoch 5 simply because the consensus will be open to the
possibility of anything from entities that have done what was agreed to
be impossible.

    There is a scary corollary to this, though.  Something that would
explain why we haven't heard about Epoch travel occurring.  If Epoch
travel is accomplished by means of ""probability travel"" and a consensus
version of Entropy, then it may be more possible for a small group,
using a lot of energy, to move ""back"" to a more ""chaotic"" Epoch which
""accepts"" the possibility.  It is much more unlikely that a small group
would be able to make a transition to a more ordered Epoch - one which
didn't believe that such transitions were possible.  It is likely that
the ""easiest"" way to move to a more ordered Epoch would be as part of a
mass consensus change in that direction.  That being said, we may wish
to hope that we are indeed at the ""temporal"" end of Epoch 3, with most
of the Wills preparing to transition to a more ordered state.

    This has been the most philosophic that I have ever been in my life
and I am now going to drive home and go to bed.

Subject: Let's do the time warp again ...


I've been giving the situation a considerable amount of thought.  With
regards to running the other groups (and determining the actions of the
NPC's) I'd like to present you with some possibilities.  I'm also confused
about the concept of ""different realities"".

I thought that you had said that although there might be other realities
populated by other Wills, their reality would be so alien to ours that there
could never be crossover because neither of us could conceive of the other.
I'm fairly certain that I must have that wrong because of what happened in
the last run, as well as the whole Star Trek bug incursion.

With regards to issue of where/when we are, there are three possibilities
that I can think of.  The first is that temporally we are in the same ""time""
as we were before I blew us up but we are in a reality formed around the
Wills of the Slaad that ""ceased to exist"" in the Epoch 3 transition.

It came to me that in each Epoch transition we have talked about massive
deaths occurring among the ""children"" of the Elder Gods.  Assuming that the
whole multi-Epoch ""Elder Gods"" concept isn't a recent reality creation, I
would expect that in most of those cases the Elder Gods deliberately
re-absorbed the wills of those who ""didn't make it"" so that they could have
more energy for the next phase.

But it is entirely possible that many of those Wills simply couldn't make
the paradigm shift to the new reality of the consensus.  If that is the case
it would have created a splinter (pocket) reality where they continued to
exist as they had before.  I believe that this explanation is not where/when
we are, but rather the description of the source of the recent incursion.

The second possibility is that we are in a different phase (time) of ""our""
reality.  This seems highly unlikely since it has been made quite clear that
there is sufficient difference between Epoch 5, Epoch 4, and Epoch 3, that
there is no way to ""shift phase"" to the earlier ""time"".

What intrigues me, though, is a contemplation of time travel as it relates
to reality in your world.  After multiple conversations I think that most of
us are pretty clear that the ""reality"" around us is an agreement, a
""consensus"", between all of the Wills that make up that consensus.  And that
""time"" is a way of grouping interactions between those Wills in a sequential
fashion.  Since the reality of ""now"" is no more than the consensus agrees it
to be, if the consensus supports the ""rule"" of time travel and the
mutability of ""events"", then it must also agree to change the parameters of
""now"" if the parameters of the ""past"" are changed.

We have discussed what happens to a ""weak"" Will if the ""body"" dies (usually
absorbed by a ""god"").  We have discussed what the agreement says happens
when an entity has been Be Not'd - although I don't believe that I have ever
seen or discussed a quantitative analysis of what happens to the Will in a
Be Not situation.  We have touched on the practice of the Gods of ""seeding""
the world with ""young"" Wills and then ""harvesting"" experienced Wills at the
end of their life span.  Given the ""reality"" of ""time"" travel, and the
ability to interact with someone who is ""currently"" ""dead"", there *must* be
continuity of Will on an ""entity"" basis.  We have discussed that Greater
Gods don't have the ability to create individual Wills (instead influencing
the ""Overmind"" to do so).  

I wonder, though, what is actually happening when the ""overmind"" creates a
being.  And does ANY entity have the power to uncreate a being?  If an
entity is Be Not'd, has it been ""destroyed""?  Or is that the consensus has
merely been persuaded that the entity does not exist and therefore it has
been excluded from the consensus; shunned/ignored.  Yet if there is some
continuity of Will through different entities, and one of those entities is
Be Not'd, the Will which made up the Be Not'd entity was another entity
""before"" and another entity ""after"".  What happened to the Will in between?

Ok, so maybe I've made a few points, but where am I going with this?

The use of the word ""Epoch"" is deceptive.  In a ""world"" where time travel
exists, but only as a ""dimension"" of the mind, Epoch implies ""time"".  We're
told that the reality difference prevents time travel between Epoch's.  Yet,
given the parameters that I discussed earlier, a Will which exists in more
than one time is still the same Will.  

Doesn't this imply that a Will that exists in more than one Epoch is still
the same Will?  And if it is, does that not imply that, at the very least,
those Wills which exist in more than one Epoch should be able to ""shift
their mental focus"" (move) between those Epoch's?  I think that it does.
But if you want to move from one Epoch to another, time travel isn't going
to get you there.  That would be like trying to take a plane to get to the
moon.  You need to use a different method.

I think that the entities that are aware of how to move from one Epoch to
another a) for some reason don't want to make reverse transitions and b)
don't want others to make reverse transitions.  One reason might be related
to a consensus version of ""Entropy"".  Entities that travel in time take
their ""power"" with them.  This is fine because time is a consensus
""illusion"".  But entities that translate to the previous Epoch may be
""leaving something behind"".  All entities know what the world has history
even if they don't know the ""history of the world"".  Yet how many entities
have any idea about the Epoch's?  We've been lead to believe that that
number is extremely low.  

If that is the case, then the consensus does not support Epoch translations
- in either direction.  So not only is it more difficult to make the
transition (because you aren't getting help from the consensus), any power
that you control  which is actually group driven (Wizardry, Divine Magic,
and most Gift Magic; possibly Alchemy, Thaumaturgy, Natural Magics, Craft
Magics, Incarnate Magic - even the Laws of Magic themselves) might be
limited or non-existent.  

Further, causality is also a consensus effect.  Thus, if there is no
awareness of other Epochs, then there will be no change to the parameters of
Epoch 5 if the parameters of Epoch 4 are changed.  Put another way, there
will be no change to the parameters of Epoch Blue if the parameters of Epoch
Yellow are changed.  That means that unless Kheldar enrolls a significant
portion of this reality, Kheldar can not affect the Epoch 5 reality at all.
Nor can we ride out the end of Epoch 3 to 4 or 4 to 5.  If we are in Epoch 3
then we will be trying to survive Epoch 3 until WE make the transition to
another reality.  

>From a strictly character oriented framework, if what I've postulated were
actually the case then only minor skills learned in this Epoch would
translate back with us.  And only because our characters would seed the
consensus of Epoch 5 with the knowledge that we had gained in skills.  

On the other hand, transition from one Epoch to another is likely to have
its advantages for us, too.  From what I've said above, it must require a
method different from ""Temporal Magic"".  And since the occurrence of Epoch
travel is extremely rare, it implies that there are no fixed parameters
regarding the effects of Epoch travel.  It is probably a lot like the space
travel in ""Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy"".  In fact, Alex set me on this
track when he talked about the Slaad Conjuration Gateway.  He said something
about anything in the gate being 50% probable.  

If we are able to return to Epoch 5, using some form of ""probability
travel"", and we prep ourselves for the instant of transition, then we may be
able to ""create"" or alter something about ourselves or the reality of Epoch
5 simply because the consensus will be open to the possibility of anything
from entities that have done what was agreed to be impossible.

There is a scary corollary to this, though.  Something that would explain
why we haven't heard about Epoch travel occurring.  If Epoch travel is
accomplished by means of ""probability travel"" and a consensus version of
Entropy, then it may be more possible for a small group, using a lot of
energy, to move ""back"" to a more ""chaotic"" Epoch which ""accepts"" the
possibility.  It is much more unlikely that a small group would be able to
make a transition to a more ordered Epoch - one which didn't believe that
such transitions were possible.  It is likely that the ""easiest"" way to move
to a more ordered Epoch would be as part of a mass consensus change in that
direction.  That being said, we may wish to hope that we are indeed at the
""temporal"" end of Epoch 3, with most of the Wills preparing to transition to
a more ordered state.

This has been the most philosophic that I have ever been in my life and I am
now going to drive home and go to bed.

There might be another possibility.  We can assume that the Slaad
reality we seem to be in is a pocket representation of the 'real' epoch
3, that it was maintained and protected by the conjuration gate, and
that the destruction of the gate simply catapulted us into that pocket
universe.

Now we have no problems re-entering epoch 5, because we never really
left.  Any artifacts or knowledge we retain is simply accounted a
'hold-over', like Khalid's already-existing power enhancer.  Rather than
leaving and re-entering our Reality, we have simply stumbled across an
archaeological treasure-trove.

Though if we are to adopt this viewpoint, we should avoid poking holes
in it that will make it more difficult to believe (and be believed-in)
on our trip home.

    Just thought I would throw in my two cents after Chris's articulate
e-mail.

    It seems to me that there are two fairly seperate issues:
    1.    Coming up with a way that will allow us to leave the third
epoch and arrive in the fifth epoch in a place and manner of our own
choosing and managing the reintegration into reality so that we maintain
our sanity.
    2.    Convincing the fifth epoch to let us back in.

    All of the analysis that Chris presented in his e-mail seems to me
to boil down to one basic principle.

    Let us assume that at some point a great discipline casting was
invoked which asserted order on a previously less ordered universe.
This discipline casting by its existance forms a barrier between the way
of looking at things before the casting and the way of looking at things
after the casting.

    Since we grew up (for the most part) in the way of looking at things
after the casting and furthermore since this way of looking at things is
a causal ordered kind of view we tend to think of our epoch as after the
third epoch.  This is also consistent with the 'person standing at the
end is the winner' viewpoint which requires us to assume we are latter
if we want to believe that our casting succeeded.

    Anyway, the actual temporal ordering is less relevant.  My point is
that by the very fact that the fifth epoch is formed by the continuing
support of this discipline casting it will resist our re-entry.
Specifically the consensus of the fifth epoch (lets call it consensus-5)
must oppose the existence of any being which claims to be able to
handle/perceive/conceive of the opposed viewpoint (lets call it the
alien-view).  The more an entity advocates or describes the alien-view
the more the consensus-5 must oppose that entity out of self defense.
Any such entity could be treated as a virus which would slowly eat away
at the strength of the discipline casting and eventually cause holes in
it.

    One possible viewpoint is that if we were to travel to the epoch-3
and return with all of our memories and then tell people all about what
we had seen we would be doing the work of the gate in making the Slaad
more present in epoch-5.  Even worse if we were to get something in
epoch-3 (like a kick ass magic item) and bring it back with us we would
definately be strengthen the slaad position and hence weakening the
barrier of consensus-5.

    I suspect in the face of that consensus-5 would fight back.  BTW:
consensus-5 could be viewed as an abstract representation of the will
momentum from the discipline cast but I think it is also a convenient
term for the set of major players who have a vested interest in keep
epoch-5 distinct from its past.

    In any case to address this point (#2 in my first list) I see a few
options:

    1.    The most successful tact may be to not return at all but to
prevent us from having left in the first place.  After all we are in the
chaos time, we should take advantage of it.  It seems to me that the
consensus-5 would be perfectly happy to let us in if we were willing to
say the following, ""Well the Slaad gate almost had us and we wrestled in
some sort of NULL space for a while but in the end we rejected the Slaad
destination and were able to divert our teleport to a new location.""

    The mind boggling question is if we do all sorts of things in
epoch-3 to repell ourselves from having come there then what will happen
to us after we never came?  The answer is we won't care because to our
selves in epoch-5 it will never have happened.  Ignore the apparent
paradoxes and they will go away.

    This seems to me the strategy the consensus-5 would most prefer.

    2.    Next best might be to treat our exit and re-entry as pure
transportationbut to tack on the following explanation, ""The thing that
makes epoch travel hard is not the going there or the coming back but
the integration and re-integration of reality shifts.  When we went to
epoch-3 we were never fully integrated and so we could never fully
interact with anyone there.  This was demonstrated by the way we kept
our own physical laws with us.  When we returned we were unable to
reconcile the world view of epoch-3 with that of epoch-5 and so in order
to re-integrate we had to lock this section of our memories under tight
mental blocks.""  This strategy once again insures the consensus-5 that
we will not be going around spreading the virus of epoch-3-speak.  On
the other hand it does allow the possibility (interesting for us - scary
for the consensus-5) that we might be able to drag tidbits out of this
locked store at a later date.  This approach also has precendence since
this is how I am saying that Olactalan-Tlovanu was able to translate
forward to become Nureyev in the current reality.  In the face of this
conversation the consensus-5 might counter-assert that if, after
reintegrating, we ever did open the locks enough to adopt the alien-view
we would automatically be catapulted out of the reality back into
epoch-3 even if nobody else knew about it.

    My opinion is that the consensus-5 would buy this with a little
grumbling.

    3.    A final possibility is that we could find some way in which
our group is so unique that our doing this journey does not in any way
set a precendant for anyone else.  This is kind of a weak argument and I
think we would have to be able to package it very convincingly for the
consensus-5 to buy it but it certainly gives us the most freedom.

    Anyway, that is what occured to me.  What do other people think?

    As far as my opinion I think 1 or 2 are both workable for me.  I am
very interested in having memories of the past but I think I already
have enough ammunition in place with my sordid past so that I don't need
to push it on this point.  #1 would probably be not only the most likely
to succeed in my eyes but also the biggest mind fuck and that has some
perverse attraction as well.

    On a related note I cannot do the 20th.  Sorry.

"RE: Gaming","That is exactly the kind of thinking which will get us back into epoch-5 in
no time flat.

BTW:  Whatever rationale we come up with I am expecting that we will still
need to cast a major ritual at the end of this to get ourselves back to as
close to normal as we were before.  Also I am assuming that whatever we do
we are far enough from the consensus reality that we can arrange the time of
our reappearance regardless of the amount of time we spend here (or at least
not at 1:1).

As such I would like to spend at least a bit of time setting up the ritual
so that it will be successful and at the same time spend a little time
exploring this place.  I know that the more we pay attention to this
counter-viewpoint the harder it will be to leave but I just love this kind
of stuff and would hate to not investigate a little.

On another note, have you seen 'Wag the Dog'?  I saw it recently and Sigmund
is reminding me of Deniros character in that.  Not the part where he orders
Dustin Hoffman killed in the end but the way that he keeps dropping these
amazing tales of things that happened (I saw the first release of the
Kennedy report...) and his partner will ask him 'Is that true?' and he just
replies 'whats truth?' or say nothing.

In general I am all for any interpretation of reality in which we all have
fun and get out alive and I am not too attached to which one it is.  Perhaps
I am really a Slaad in disguise who only says he used to be a Kua-Toa to
throw people off.  You have to admit, I could cause a lot more chaos from
inside the organization.  Also, which is more likely, a Kua-Toa who appears
to be a Dreamwalker or a Slaad who appears to be a Builder mage.  Kind of
makes you wonder doesn't it.  Maybe theres no need for the Slaad to invade
the fifth epoch.  Maybe we're already here.

Khalid's already-existing power enhancer.  Rather than leaving and
re-entering our Reality, we have simply stumbled across an archaeological
treasure-trove.

  Though if we are to adopt this viewpoint, we should avoid poking holes in
it that will make it more difficult to believe (and be believed-in) on our
trip home.

    Just thought I would throw in my two cents after Chris's articulate
e-mail.

    It seems to me that there are two fairly seperate issues:
    1.    Coming up with a way that will allow us to leave the third epoch
and arrive in the fifth epoch in a place and manner of our own choosing and
managing the reintegration into reality so that we maintain our sanity.
    2.    Convincing the fifth epoch to let us back in.

    All of the analysis that Chris presented in his e-mail seems to me to
boil down to one basic principle.

    Let us assume that at some point a great discipline casting was invoked
which asserted order on a previously less ordered universe.  This discipline
casting by its existance forms a barrier between the way of looking at
things before the casting and the way of looking at things after the
casting.

    Since we grew up (for the most part) in the way of looking at things
after the casting and furthermore since this way of looking at things is a
causal ordered kind of view we tend to think of our epoch as after the third
epoch.  This is also consistent with the 'person standing at the end is the
winner' viewpoint which requires us to assume we are latter if we want to
believe that our casting succeeded.

    Anyway, the actual temporal ordering is less relevant.  My point is that
by the very fact that the fifth epoch is formed by the continuing support of
this discipline casting it will resist our re-entry.  Specifically the
consensus of the fifth epoch (lets call it consensus-5) must oppose the
existence of any being which claims to be able to handle/perceive/conceive
of the opposed viewpoint (lets call it the alien-view).  The more an entity
advocates or describes the alien-view the more the consensus-5 must oppose
that entity out of self defense.  Any such entity could be treated as a
virus which would slowly eat away at the strength of the discipline casting
and eventually cause holes in it.

    One possible viewpoint is that if we were to travel to the epoch-3 and
return with all of our memories and then tell people all about what we had
seen we would be doing the work of the gate in making the Slaad more present
in epoch-5.  Even worse if we were to get something in epoch-3 (like a kick
ass magic item) and bring it back with us we would definately be strengthen
the slaad position and hence weakening the barrier of consensus-5.

    I suspect in the face of that consensus-5 would fight back.  BTW:
consensus-5 could be viewed as an abstract representation of the will
momentum from the discipline cast but I think it is also a convenient term
for the set of major players who have a vested interest in keep epoch-5
distinct from its past.

    In any case to address this point (#2 in my first list) I see a few
options:

    1.    The most successful tact may be to not return at all but to
prevent us from having left in the first place.  After all we are in the
chaos time, we should take advantage of it.  It seems to me that the
consensus-5 would be perfectly happy to let us in if we were willing to say
the following, ""Well the Slaad gate almost had us and we wrestled in some
sort of NULL space for a while but in the end we rejected the Slaad
destination and were able to divert our teleport to a new location.""

    The mind boggling question is if we do all sorts of things in epoch-3 to
repell ourselves from having come there then what will happen to us after we
never came?  The answer is we won't care because to our selves in epoch-5 it
will never have happened.  Ignore the apparent paradoxes and they will go
away.

    This seems to me the strategy the consensus-5 would most prefer.

    2.    Next best might be to treat our exit and re-entry as pure
transportationbut to tack on the following explanation, ""The thing that
makes epoch travel hard is not the going there or the coming back but the
integration and re-integration of reality shifts.  When we went to epoch-3
we were never fully integrated and so we could never fully interact with
anyone there.  This was demonstrated by the way we kept our own physical
laws with us.  When we returned we were unable to reconcile the world view
of epoch-3 with that of epoch-5 and so in order to re-integrate we had to
lock this section of our memories under tight mental blocks.""  This strategy
once again insures the consensus-5 that we will not be going around
spreading the virus of epoch-3-speak.  On the other hand it does allow the
possibility (interesting for us - scary for the consensus-5) that we might
be able to drag tidbits out of this locked store at a later date.  This
approach also has precendence since this is how I am saying that
Olactalan-Tlovanu was able to translate forward to become Nureyev in the
current reality.  In the face of this conversation the consensus-5 might
counter-assert that if, after reintegrating, we ever did open the locks
enough to adopt the alien-view we would automatically be catapulted out of
the reality back into epoch-3 even if nobody else knew about it.

    My opinion is that the consensus-5 would buy this with a little
grumbling.

    3.    A final possibility is that we could find some way in which our
group is so unique that our doing this journey does not in any way set a
precendant for anyone else.  This is kind of a weak argument and I think we
would have to be able to package it very convincingly for the consensus-5 to
buy it but it certainly gives us the most freedom.

    Anyway, that is what occured to me.  What do other people think?

    As far as my opinion I think 1 or 2 are both workable for me.  I am very
interested in having memories of the past but I think I already have enough
ammunition in place with my sordid past so that I don't need to push it on
this point.  #1 would probably be not only the most likely to succeed in my
eyes but also the biggest mind fuck and that has some perverse attraction as
well.

    On a related note I cannot do the 20th.  Sorry.

"RE: Gaming","My apologies.  I have been changing the names of this thing trying to find
one that I like.  The current working names are W:Drawing and The Builder's
Ways (The Builders being another name I have for the Kua-Toa and a good
antonym for The Dreamers).  I would be happy to help you learn this Wizardry
although I warn you that if you succesfully learn it you will no longer
qualify as human.  The changes in mindset required to be able to cast it may
require that you become partially a third/fourth epoch entity.  That is not
entirely accurate what I just said but lets say you would have to give up a
large number of things that you take as fundamental and the result would be
that you could no longer belong to the racial pattern that you were a member
of before.  That said, once the sacrifice is made you get access to cool
powers and most people will be your friend even if you are insane.

Thanks.  I'm kinda wondering if it's feasible for Eman to start picking up
String Art (or whatever the Kua-Toa proto-wizardry is) as his third W:.
That would extend our stay somewhat, though if we can return on a bias (and
there's no known reason we can't, so we might as well) that will be less of
an issue.

Of course, it might not be possible to stay here too long without
acclimating, and consciously trying to learn old skills might speed up that
process.

I doubt we can return to our exact point of temporal origin, anyway, though
we can probably shave it pretty close.  Retroactive endurance penalties
might be applied to us, for instance, that would make it prohibitively
expensive.  I suspect Alex would allow us to un-do the news of our demise,
though he'd probably give the high-level types a good save to remember that
we used to be dead.

(""Aren't you supposed to be dead?""  ""I get that a lot."")

  That is exactly the kind of thinking which will get us back into epoch-5
in no time flat.

  BTW:  Whatever rationale we come up with I am expecting that we will still
need to cast a major ritual at the end of this to get ourselves back to as
close to normal as we were before.  Also I am assuming that whatever we do
we are far enough from the consensus reality that we can arrange the time of
our reappearance regardless of the amount of time we spend here (or at least
not at 1:1).

  As such I would like to spend at least a bit of time setting up the ritual
so that it will be successful and at the same time spend a little time
exploring this place.  I know that the more we pay attention to this
counter-viewpoint the harder it will be to leave but I just love this kind
of stuff and would hate to not investigate a little.

  On another note, have you seen 'Wag the Dog'?  I saw it recently and
Sigmund is reminding me of Deniros character in that.  Not the part where he
orders Dustin Hoffman killed in the end but the way that he keeps dropping
these amazing tales of things that happened (I saw the first release of the
Kennedy report...) and his partner will ask him 'Is that true?' and he just
replies 'whats truth?' or say nothing.

  In general I am all for any interpretation of reality in which we all have
fun and get out alive and I am not too attached to which one it is.  Perhaps
I am really a Slaad in disguise who only says he used to be a Kua-Toa to
throw people off.  You have to admit, I could cause a lot more chaos from
inside the organization.  Also, which is more likely, a Kua-Toa who appears
to be a Dreamwalker or a Slaad who appears to be a Builder mage.  Kind of
makes you wonder doesn't it.  Maybe theres no need for the Slaad to invade
the fifth epoch.  Maybe we're already here.

    Oh, my.  Yet another really odd (but valid and possibly more accurate
than my own) viewpoint.

    There might be another possibility.  We can assume that the Slaad
reality we seem to be in is a pocket representation of the 'real' epoch 3,
that it was maintained and protected by the conjuration gate, and that the
destruction of the gate simply catapulted us into that pocket universe.

succeeded.

                Anyway, the actual temporal ordering is less relevant.
My point is that by the very fact that the fifth epoch is formed by the
continuing support of this discipline casting it will resist our
re-entry.  Specifically the consensus of the fifth epoch (lets call it
consensus-5) must oppose the existence of any being which claims to be
able to handle/perceive/conceive of the opposed viewpoint (lets call it
the alien-view).  The more an entity advocates or describes the
alien-view the more the consensus-5 must oppose that entity out of self
defense.  Any such entity could be treated as a virus which would slowly
eat away at the strength of the discipline casting and eventually cause
holes in it.

                One possible viewpoint is that if we were to travel to
the epoch-3 and return with all of our memories and then tell people all
about what we had seen we would be doing the work of the gate in making
the Slaad more present in epoch-5.  Even worse if we were to get
something in epoch-3 (like a kick ass magic item) and bring it back with
us we would definately be strengthen the slaad position and hence
weakening the barrier of consensus-5.

                I suspect in the face of that consensus-5 would fight
back.  BTW: consensus-5 could be viewed as an abstract representation of
the will momentum from the discipline cast but I think it is also a
convenient term for the set of major players who have a vested interest
in keep epoch-5 distinct from its past.

                In any case to address this point (#2 in my first list)
I see a few options:

                1.    The most successful tact may be to not return at
all but to prevent us from having left in the first place.  After all we
are in the chaos time, we should take advantage of it.  It seems to me
that the consensus-5 would be perfectly happy to let us in if we were
willing to say the following, ""Well the Slaad gate almost had us and we
wrestled in some sort of NULL space for a while but in the end we
rejected the Slaad destination and were able to divert our teleport to a
new location.""

                The mind boggling question is if we do all sorts of
things in epoch-3 to repell ourselves from having come there then what
will happen to us after we never came?  The answer is we won't care
because to our selves in epoch-5 it will never have happened.  Ignore
the apparent paradoxes and they will go away.

                This seems to me the strategy the consensus-5 would most
prefer.

                2.    Next best might be to treat our exit and re-entry
as pure transportationbut to tack on the following explanation, ""The
thing that makes epoch travel hard is not the going there or the coming
back but the integration and re-integration of reality shifts.  When we
went to epoch-3 we were never fully integrated and so we could never
fully interact with anyone there.  This was demonstrated by the way we
kept our own physical laws with us.  When we returned we were unable to
reconcile the world view of epoch-3 with that of epoch-5 and so in order
to re-integrate we had to lock this section of our memories under tight
mental blocks.""  This strategy once again insures the consensus-5 that
we will not be going around spreading the virus of epoch-3-speak.  On
the other hand it does allow the possibility (interesting for us - scary
for the consensus-5) that we might be able to drag tidbits out of this
locked store at a later date.  This approach also has precendence since
this is how I am saying that Olactalan-Tlovanu was able to translate
forward to become Nureyev in the current reality.  In the face of this
conversation the consensus-5 might counter-assert that if, after
reintegrating, we ever did open the locks enough to adopt the alien-view
we would automatically be catapulted out of the reality back into
epoch-3 even if nobody else knew about it.

                My opinion is that the consensus-5 would buy this with a
little grumbling.

                3.    A final possibility is that we could find some way
in which our group is so unique that our doing this journey does not in
any way set a precendant for anyone else.  This is kind of a weak
argument and I think we would have to be able to package it very
convincingly for the consensus-5 to buy it but it certainly gives us the
most freedom.

                Anyway, that is what occured to me.  What do other
people think?

                As far as my opinion I think 1 or 2 are both workable
for me.  I am very interested in having memories of the past but I think
I already have enough ammunition in place with my sordid past so that I
don't need to push it on this point.  #1 would probably be not only the
most likely to succeed in my eyes but also the biggest mind fuck and
that has some perverse attraction as well.

    My apologies.  I have been changing the names of this thing trying to
find one that I like.  The current working names are W:Drawing and The
Builder's Ways (The Builders being another name I have for the Kua-Toa and a
good antonym for The Dreamers).  I would be happy to help you learn this
Wizardry although I warn you that if you succesfully learn it you will no
longer qualify as human.  The changes in mindset required to be able to cast
it may require that you become partially a third/fourth epoch entity.  That
is not entirely accurate what I just said but lets say you would have to
give up a large number of things that you take as fundamental and the result
would be that you could no longer belong to the racial pattern that you were
a member of before.  That said, once the sacrifice is made you get access to
cool powers and most people will be your friend even if you are insane.

    Thanks.  I'm kinda wondering if it's feasible for Eman to start picking
up String Art (or whatever the Kua-Toa proto-wizardry is) as his third W:.
That would extend our stay somewhat, though if we can return on a bias (and
there's no known reason we can't, so we might as well) that will be less of
an issue.

    Of course, it might not be possible to stay here too long without
acclimating, and consciously trying to learn old skills might speed up that
process.

    I doubt we can return to our exact point of temporal origin, anyway,
though we can probably shave it pretty close.  Retroactive endurance
penalties might be applied to us, for instance, that would make it
prohibitively expensive.  I suspect Alex would allow us to un-do the news of
our demise, though he'd probably give the high-level types a good save to
remember that we used to be dead.

    (""Aren't you supposed to be dead?""  ""I get that a lot."")

    Thinking of changing his name to ""Erithmaeon, the Binder"", on our
return.

      That is exactly the kind of thinking which will get us back into
epoch-5 in no time flat.

      BTW:  Whatever rationale we come up with I am expecting that we will
still need to cast a major ritual at the end of this to get ourselves back
to as close to normal as we were before.  Also I am assuming that whatever
we do we are far enough from the consensus reality that we can arrange the
time of our reappearance regardless of the amount of time we spend here (or
at least not at 1:1).

      As such I would like to spend at least a bit of time setting up the
ritual so that it will be successful and at the same time spend a little
time exploring this place.  I know that the more we pay attention to this
counter-viewpoint the harder it will be to leave but I just love this kind
of stuff and would hate to not investigate a little.

      On another note, have you seen 'Wag the Dog'?  I saw it recently and
Sigmund is reminding me of Deniros character in that.  Not the part where he
orders Dustin Hoffman killed in the end but the way that he keeps dropping
these amazing tales of things that happened (I saw the first release of the
Kennedy report...) and his partner will ask him 'Is that true?' and he just
replies 'whats truth?' or say nothing.

      In general I am all for any interpretation of reality in which we all
have fun and get out alive and I am not too attached to which one it is.
Perhaps I am really a Slaad in disguise who only says he used to be a
Kua-Toa to throw people off.  You have to admit, I could cause a lot more
chaos from inside the organization.  Also, which is more likely, a Kua-Toa
who appears to be a Dreamwalker or a Slaad who appears to be a Builder mage.
Kind of makes you wonder doesn't it.  Maybe theres no need for the Slaad to
invade the fifth epoch.  Maybe we're already here.

        Oh, my.  Yet another really odd (but valid and possibly more
accurate than my own) viewpoint.

        There might be another possibility.  We can assume that the Slaad
reality we seem to be in is a pocket representation of the 'real' epoch 3,
that it was maintained and protected by the conjuration gate, and that the
destruction of the gate simply catapulted us into that pocket universe.

        Now we have no problems re-entering epoch 5, because we never really
left.  Any artifacts or knowledge we retain is simply accounted a
'hold-over', like Khalid's already-existing power enhancer.  Rather than
leaving and re-entering our Reality, we have simply stumbled across an
archaeological treasure-trove.

        Though if we are to adopt this viewpoint, we should avoid poking
holes in it that will make it more difficult to believe (and be believed-in)
on our trip home.

          Just thought I would throw in my two cents after Chris's
articulate e-mail.

          It seems to me that there are two fairly seperate issues:
          1.    Coming up with a way that will allow us to leave the third
epoch and arrive in the fifth epoch in a place and manner of our own
choosing and managing the reintegration into reality so that we maintain our
sanity.
          2.    Convincing the fifth epoch to let us back in.

          All of the analysis that Chris presented in his e-mail seems to me
to boil down to one basic principle.

          Let us assume that at some point a great discipline casting was
invoked which asserted order on a previously less ordered universe.  This
discipline casting by its existance forms a barrier between the way of
looking at things before the casting and the way of looking at things after
the casting.

          Since we grew up (for the most part) in the way of looking at
things after the casting and furthermore since this way of looking at things
is a causal ordered kind of view we tend to think of our epoch as after the
third epoch.  This is also consistent with the 'person standing at the end
is the winner' viewpoint which requires us to assume we are latter if we
want to believe that our casting succeeded.

          Anyway, the actual temporal ordering is less relevant.  My point
is that by the very fact that the fifth epoch is formed by the continuing
support of this discipline casting it will resist our re-entry.
Specifically the consensus of the fifth epoch (lets call it consensus-5)
must oppose the existence of any being which claims to be able to
handle/perceive/conceive of the opposed viewpoint (lets call it the
alien-view).  The more an entity advocates or describes the alien-view the
more the consensus-5 must oppose that entity out of self defense.  Any such
entity could be treated as a virus which would slowly eat away at the
strength of the discipline casting and eventually cause holes in it.

          One possible viewpoint is that if we were to travel to the epoch-3
and return with all of our memories and then tell people all about what we
had seen we would be doing the work of the gate in making the Slaad more
present in epoch-5.  Even worse if we were to get something in epoch-3 (like
a kick ass magic item) and bring it back with us we would definately be
strengthen the slaad position and hence weakening the barrier of
consensus-5.

          I suspect in the face of that consensus-5 would fight back.  BTW:
consensus-5 could be viewed as an abstract representation of the will
momentum from the discipline cast but I think it is also a convenient term
for the set of major players who have a vested interest in keep epoch-5
distinct from its past.

          In any case to address this point (#2 in my first list) I see a
few options:

          1.    The most successful tact may be to not return at all but to
prevent us from having left in the first place.  After all we are in the
chaos time, we should take advantage of it.  It seems to me that the
consensus-5 would be perfectly happy to let us in if we were willing to say
the following, ""Well the Slaad gate almost had us and we wrestled in some
sort of NULL space for a while but in the end we rejected the Slaad
destination and were able to divert our teleport to a new location.""

"RE: Game Mechanics","RE: Game MechanicsSome comments:



    degree of leveraging the ever-useful reality shift to explain why both
interpretations of certain issues are true depending on which side of a
reality shift you are standing on.   I can't speak for Chris but from my
perspective I feel like we are not completely unified in world-view but it
is working well.


  Chris and Kheldar know that the ""facts"" and the ""rules"" have been
different in previous realities.  Kheldar and Chris both assume that the
rules and the facts are the same for all entities sharing the same reality.
ie. in Doria of this reality, the history of Marden is the same for all
entities.  Characters with reality knowledge may have multiple memories (two
or more ways that Marden developed) but all characters of this reality share
the ACTUALITY of this reality.  Likewise, the pattern of Fire in this
reality is the pattern of Fire.  It is what it is and it isn't something
else.  One character who thinks that it allows you to cast water spells
isn't going to be using it to irrigate the fields.


Sigmund does not actually operate under this assumption.  He feels it is
perfectly normal that there may be a thing (like the pattern of fire) that
for some people it IS impossible for it to do X and for other people it IS
possible for it to do X and yet for practical purposes they both live in the
same reality.

Specifically it seems normal and likely to Sigmund that there exist two
people in Marden.  One person lives in a world view in which time travel is
impossible and another lives in a worldview in which time travel is merely
difficult.  Because the primacy of immediate concerns makes there worlds
essentially identical they are considered in the same reality even though
there is a relatively obscure difference about their CONCEPT of what is
possible that renders their realitities not identical.  From Sigmund's
persepective no two people ever live in the same reality but locations on
the prime are  fuzzy containers that let us group together people that are
relatively similar.  That said, for practical purposes I like to go with the
flow except where it strongly deviates from my personal reality.



    In truth, I use the same philosophy when it comes to elves.
Specifically there are a number of things that Mordenaith thinks are
impossible that I believe are possible and a number of things that he thinks
are hard that I think are easier (probably not easy).  Over the course of
the game I have just chalked this up to (a character's) perception of
reality generates the rules that they operate against.  I am not saying we
can all just decide to do anything but I am saying that it didn't seem
inconsistent to me that different characters would operate under different
rules and limitations (including to some extent fundamental principles of
magic) based on their worldview.


  You seem to be speaking as Sigmund here, but I'm not sure.  At the base of
everything, we are players playing a game.  In order for a game to be
playable, it must have rules and those rules must apply equally to all
players.  Those rules may state that there are no magic rules and you can
have your character do anything that it wants, but there must be rules.  And
we as players must ultimately agree to those rules with Alex, who defines
the game.  If you go to Vegas and tell the dealer at the Black Jack table
that you won rather than lost because the rules of the game are that scores
of 25 always win, you'll get your legs broken.

T he above opinion was spoken in the frame of Sigmund.  In fact, all
opinions I express are SOLELY expressed as the opinion Sigmund would have.
Sometimes it is the opinion he would have if he had knowledge which he
doesn't so it becomes hypothetical but I don't see a point in having
opinions which are not expressed with respect to some characters worldview.

As far as I know the rules for BT work as follows:

  a.. Everything works the way the BT rules say unless you think it should
be otherwise and then you have to get a specific exception approved by Alex
which may very well be personal to your character and not apply to any other
character.

EXAMPLE:  For Sigmund Ki Focus (and as far as I know Fortu in general) is a
4 count action whereas for everyone else it takes a minute.

  a.. You can only make statements about the present.  Anything that
happened in the past is merely opinion or memory and different people will
have different opinions and memories.  If you get to be high enough level
you can have any opinion that you want but if your opinions diverge too much
from the consensus you will spin off into your own private reality and never
be seen again.

  a.. Everything else is just a story and we make it up as we go.

  Capiche?


    I think that it is a wonderful gaming opportunity for each character to
be able to guide the


  you mean, ""for each PLAYER to be able to guide ..."", yes?


Yes you are right, it is the player that is the real person and the
character that is imaginary.  I keep forgetting.  But seriously, my ""writing
style"" is character motivated.  It is a stylistic thing but it basically
means I tend not to express opinions about anything Sigmund is not involved
in, I express opinions through the form of my own narrative history or my
own knowledge base and so the player-character distinction does not seem to
relevant to me.  If I had another character in BT I would most certainly
disagree with myself about issues like how magic works and what the origin
of the universe is.



    As such I think it is good if we all work together to rationalize our
worldviews but I also think that it needs to be acceptable for me to dictate
my characters view about what the Truth is about Odin and Mordenaith and
have this be different than these respective characters self perception.


  It is absolutely acceptable for Pookie to dictate Sigmund's VIEW about
what the Truth is about Odin and have this be different than Kheldar's VIEW
about what the Truth is about Odin and that may still be different than
Odin's VIEW about what the Truth is about Odin.  However it is not
acceptable for Pookie to dictate what IS TRUE about Odin.  That privilege is
for Alex and those players whose characters have a significant stake in the
plot concept of Odin.


As far as the rest of this I tried writing a paragraph explaining it but I
am getting a little lost in the fact that this is a very abstract topic.
Let me organize my thoughts for a while.  Suffice it to say that there are
several things that other players believe about the nature of reality that I
(as Sigmund) am unwilling to agree IS the truth.  And for me I will operate
as if my view IS the truth and therefor it will be.  I acknowledge the fact
that other people have other truths even as I try to change them.  Does this
make me a preceptor?  or a dreamwalker? or just a PC?

How can you tell?

Even the hard physical sciences include the Heisenberg Principle,
photons being both particle and wave, and a host of squirmy quantum
events too horrible to mention.  (Or which I am insufficiently
familiar with to pull into this arg.. er, discussion off the top of my
head.)

On the slightly more philosophical side (with the usual caveats about
stand-up philosophers) there are several theories about
parallel/branching worlds that don't contradict known physics.
(Admittedly, most of their evidence is conveniently located in a
parallel universe, where we can't see it, but still...)

Me, I'll stick with the old consensus-building adage:  ""If you can't
tell, it doesn't matter.""

<shrug>

What practical difference does it make?  To the total extent of our
understanding at one point, the sun revolved around the earth, and the
stars were graven on crystal spheres held, for all I know, by angels.
To the total extent of our understanding now, the earth revolves
around the sun, and stars are huge balls of fusing hydrogen plasma
incredibly far away.

If you want, you can posit that there was a reality shift, so now the
sun was now 'always' a ball of gas (and may have been something else
in an earlier reality), or you can say that the first assumption was
incorrect, and we now have a clearer view of the process than our
imaginative ancestors.  Either way, daylight comes and goes, and the
stars shine down on us all.

While I see your point that it is extremely unlikely two astronauts
will go up and one of them will bump into a crystal sphere while the
other spends many years traveling very fast only to fall into a
distant sun, for all practical purposes (astronauts still being a
minute percentage of the populace) it just doesn't matter!

There may be one ""true"" underlying universe.  There may be a
hodgepodge of fuzzy, ill-defined personal universes that negotiate
most of their interactions.  I suspect the BT universe is somewhere
between those two options.  But all we know is that this is the way
things behave.  Here (the 'real world', not to be confused with
anything produced by MTV), as well as there (the BT world, rather
easily confused by Player Characters.)

Note that even in a 'hodgepodge' model, one might require certain
commonalities to interact at all, like arm-flapping not equaling
flight.  OTOH, since you would be dwelling in your own universe, you
might simply not perceive the flight (since it's defined for you as
impossible), and judge the flapping man to be quite mad.  Anything
else might require an external force to change your personal universe
(an entirely different feat), or for you to give up your cozy little
universe and venture into unknown Realities.  (And no, I neither know
how to do that or suggest that it would be a Good Idea.  Though it
seems the sort of thing that a Shifter would try.)

Again, if you can't tell, it doesn't matter.  (The corollary being
that it it's that important, you should find a way to tell.)

Agreed.  At least for sufficiently small values of 'few'.  And for
sufficiently physical definitions of 'IS'.

A lot of people used to believe that smoking was cool.  Now, a lot of
people believe that smokers should take it outside, adding pneumonia
to their health risks.  (Note, this is not an endorsement of smoking.
It's a silly and dangerous habit, and trains people to litter.)
Something has changed because of what people believe.

So much for sophistry.

It is possible that what a LOT of people believe changes what IS.
Particularly in the BT universe, where Belief is practically a law of
physics.  I have seen no proof to the contrary in this universe.
(Again, a tricky one to prove..  By the time evidence is found to
contradict the old 'fact', a lot of people believe something else.)

I might suggest that Kheldar and ODIN each have their own beliefs
regarding the ultimate cohesion of Reality.  (Heck, maybe even the
same belief.)  They should plan their actions based on that.

In my opinion, based on my observations of the BT universe, ""reality""
is a quilt of various other aggregate-realities,. which may in turn be
composed of smaller units, possibly down to the level of the
Context-Generating Entity (GCE).  If you'll recall Kheldar's actions
during the Heartstone Ritual, he 'flavored' the quilt with ""Norse"",
making several of the quilt-pieces where ODIN was worshipped
accessible to the main.

Whatever theory you're using, it seems to be accurate enough to get
results.  In the Heartstone Ritual, and all your messing with the
Machine (and the new Machine Jr.), you have proven capable of changing
Reality at least insofar as you and your companions see it.  I'd say
you've got a handle on it.

I re-read this as I was looking to see if I had Alex's stories (I don't).  I
didn't think of it at the time you sent it, but the entity that you are
talking about is Hades.  He is the Lord of the Dead.  He doesn't care how
they die.  His Paladins are very impersonal.  (like him; I don't think the
guy HAS a sense of humor)

However I should add that some of your examples don't hold true.  Asmonar
created the Incarnations of Death, Famine, and Pestilence to increase his
yield.  I think that is why Hades isn't nearly as powerful as Arken.

Alex, have you thought about when Hades was born with regards to Arken,
Heimdal, and Arioch?

I had an odd character concept/plot twist for a character in Alex's world.
It is based on the following presumption:

 

Most characters which are related to Death are ussually characterized as
evil (excepting of course current party members/deities of the dead).  It
occured to me that philosophically you could have a religous paladin of
death who was impersonal rather than evil based on the following argument:

 

There is a certain class of death I will call environmental death (disease,
hunger, hypothermia,...) which is distinct from violent death or other
direct killing by a CGB*.  In general we can say that environmental death is
based on locations and occurs because the dead person was not suitable for
the environment.  One question that comes from this is why should such harsh
environments exist?  In a consensus reality we can conclude that the
statement ""a person dies of thirst in the desert because it is a harsh
environment"" is motivated by the consensus asserting that ""deserts are harsh
environments"" or ""deserts are places were people die"".  Why then would the
consensus want to make locations were people die?  One reason would be crowd
control.  Planar theory says that we generate the physical world around us
to suit our needs.  Perhaps plagues and hunger in overcrowded cities is just
the consensus' way to encourage us to spread out a little.  Perhaps deserts
and arctic tundras are the consensus' way to get us not to spread out to
much.  After all, the prime leads us to believe that each location must have
a location next to it (no one has yet found and edge) therefor the only
thing that prevents us from spreading out infintiley far from each other is
that environments become to harsh and we become over extended.  In other
words we face death.  Environmental death is not an immediate thing.  It
comes on gradually giving us plenty of time to recognize the error of our
ways and move to a more suitable location.

 

Possesing this attitude a death-paladin would feel more like a shepard than
a homicidal maniac.  In fact this death-paladin might even regret it when
people die.  Sort of along the lines of ""well I gave them a lot of warnings
but they ignored it.  Mores the pity.""

"Gaming - The fourth epoch transition","In my last post I had sort of glossed over the fourth epoch.  This was
because I was less certain of what was going on there than in the others.
Based on the fundamental conflict viewpoint that I had put forward in my
Theory of Magic I think I have discovered the fundamental conflict of the
fourth epoch.

One of my core historical assumptions is that you don't get an epoch change
unless there is a fundamental shift in the nature of reality. Otherwise it
would just be an era shift, or even just time passing.  Therefor there must
be something fundamentally different between the fourth and the fifth epoch.
With one, two and three I have painted this as existence, individuality and
a consensus.  All three of these are MAJOR concept shifts.  It is difficult
for me to come up with something as fundamental for the fourth epoch
transition but here goes.

The key to the conflicts in the first three epochs is the evolution of
being.  The closer that you get to the present the harder it is to
distinguish the fundmanental precept changes that characterize that
evolution.  If we look at the artifacts (things left over) of the fourth
epoch however the major one which stands out for me is the balance.

[I assume the balance is a fourth epoch creation for most people.  I also
assume that the gates of Chronos and the Bifrost are fifth epoch creations.
Are the gates fourth?]

The key operational principle of the balance is individual moderation.  One
way to look at the balance is to view it as a tool that prevents any one
entity from having an inordinate amount of control on the consensus.
Another way to look at it is that it is a tool that discourages the forces
on the consensus from being to centralized (controlled by a small number of
wills).  From this perspective the balance can be seen as yet another swing
of the pendulum.  The pendulum being the following progression:

1.    Existence - Pro-Unity Anti-Entropy (if you consider the ultimate
entropic state = heat death = non-existence)
2.    Individuality - Anti-Unity Pro-Entropy (a greater number of smaller
individuals = more chaos and fragmentation)
3.    Consensus - Pro-Unity Anti-Entropy (a consensus promotes uniformity
which counters fragmentation)
4.    Balance - Anti-Unity Pro-Entropy (a balance prevents ""clumping"" and
promotes more diversity)

>From the perspective of conflict resolution this seems to fit the bill for
an epoch transition but it still does not fit the metaphysical requirement
of a fundamental change in perspective.  Perhaps part of the reason this is
hard is that I may have jumped to far ahead in the third epoch transition.

When the Kua-Toa created the UniverseNet they created a consensus which
allowed individuals to live in a reality that all could agree on.  Implicit
in this design is a restorative force that attempts to forcefully bring the
individual into alignment with the consensus.  It may have been erroneous to
identify this force with temporality and causality.  Or more precisely it
may have been correct to identify it with temporality as a now measurable
concept but not with causality.

Causality is a specific ordering proposition that drastically reduces the
number of possible presents based on past events.  Another way to look at
this is that causality makes a requirement that the farther back you change
an event (the more fundamental a change is) the more force is required to
accomplish it.  At the surface this sounds like a necessary property of the
basic UniverseNet and in fact it must have been.  Operationally however it
is likely that for the majority of the fourth epoch time travel was
drastically easier and the nature of reality had not reached the stability
of its current expression.

And in fact this is the key.  The second fundamental concept of the fourth
epoch (besides the balance) is the prime.  The prime as we know it today is
a function of the bifrost but the fact is that by the very nature of humans
the fundamental concept of primeness must have been the establishing concept
of the fifth epoch.  The core of primeness has to do with the path of
reality.  Without primeness you could have a consensus that, at any point in
time, was shared by all people to some degree, but which over time wandered
all over the realm of possibility.  With primeness the character of the
universe from one moment to the next will follow an orderly progression and
the past will appear fairly similar to the present.  In fact the nature of
primeness can probably be stated as ""the consensus view of the present will
always have the appearance of being the logical progression of the past"".  I
am havinbg trouble getting a good sound bite here but I think this is the
core concept.

This function (making the present seem to follow logically from the past)
may be the thing that causes people to forget the old past when they fail
there save vs.  a reality alteration.  This might not be a necessary
consequence of reality alteration itself.  I can also see how primeness and
the balance are integrally related.

Hmmm, I must think about this more.  This could even change my view of the
advisability of submitting to the balance.

Once I have all of these thoughts coherent I will fold them back into my
theory of magic document just so I can keep a single repository.

"Gaming - Death vs. Termination","Just another thought now that I have the old brain running on something
interesting.  So what is this thing called death anyway?  It occurs to me
that death and life are probably recent concepts (epoch 4).  Let me tell you
why.

First of all let me clear up something that bugs me occasionally because I
play a character with no life or death and yet people still want to kill me.

I think there are two fundamental concepts independant of life and death:
Termination and Initiation.

I think that these concepts did not exist prior to the third epoch and are
natural offshoots of the world network.  Non-existance has existed from day
one but I will assert that it is very different for Sigmund to get killed
(non-existance is more life falling into the void).

I think termination and initiation have to do with being connected to a
consensus.  If you have a consensus with any authority you need a way for
the consensus to take an individual and say, ""Nope - your current worldview
breaks the rules - you need to junk it and start a new one"".  Notice how
this does not cause the individual to not exist.  It merely says that its
prior reality is no longer viable and it needs to try something different.
>From the perspective of others you become an inert lump of matter, but from
your perspective you just stop, you lose your body entirely including all
memories and then you get a new body including new memories (or more likely
starting with a clean slate - goo goo).  If you anthropomorphize the context
generating nature of us all then it is a big ""Game Over"" and you need to
start a new game (roll up a new character).

As part of the Kua-Toa machinery that was created for the network, there was
a huge recycler.  This recycler represented a coordinating source for
reality wipe and restarts.  One of the things that was probably found early
on was that if you wiped and restarted a node without giving it a seed
reality it would probably reboot in a state that was in violation with the
consensus and need to get immediately wiped again.  The recycler would give
seed reality hints for new reboots so that individuals who were not to in
tune with the network had an easy way to boot into a valid consensus
reality.  Real power hackers could reboot, ignore the hints, scan the
network on startup and control the rebuild of their new reality to conform
to their liking.

Anyway, one side effect of the recycler was that people learned to hack it
and then they could put in requests for specific forms and places when a
rebooting node became available.  This was used by some to put bound souls
into artifacts by grabbing them as they come off of the presses.  Some
people also say that this is the basis for some of the greater summonings
(the horde of demons out there waiting to come in is just a metaphor to hide
the fact that we are creating evil from ourselves - maybe).

Some people say that the halls of the dead are a symbol for the recycler.

In any case termination is the act of the universe shutting down your old
reality and initiation is the act of the recycler giving you boot up hints
for your new reality (applies to people of all elemental compositions).

Now, based on this what is death and life?  At first glance they may seem
pretty superflous.  In fact they are not.  Death magic really has three
independant focuses.  The first is killing people.  The second is undead.
The third is soul manipulation.  I have a lot harder time describing life
magic because, basically, all I see are healers and they seem pretty limited
from my exposure.  I don't feel like I have met a real life mage (except
maybe Madra).

Anyway, from my experience with life and death, it seems that these concepts
are two different world-views with a defined boundary point of the
termination-initiation transition.  Death does not mean the absence of
motion if you are talking to a zombie or a death lord.  Operationally an
undead creature is just as active as a living one.  Even words like growth
seem to apply equally well to a plague as to a rose bush.

My feeling is that life and death are dim shadows of the unity-diversity
struggle.  The big difference I see between living things and dead things is
that dead things seem to live in a much more hierarchical dominating
structure and living things seem to live in a much more independant chaotic
divergent kind of pattern.  I would say that life and death are two
fundamental worldview flavors that are wrestling for domination of the
world.

Furthermore, I would say that death magics and life magics capitalize on the
network by leveraging the termination points and initiation points of the
recycler respectively.  This has to do with the fact that individuals are at
their most vulnerabe during reboot transition.  A necromancer specializes in
manipulating ""souls"" if it can encounter them at their death point.  He can
color their next universe more towards the death spectrum, he can capture
their soul and bind it to the body as a zombie, he can temporarily leverage
their will as a power source before they are released to the recycler.

Similarly a life mage specializes in manipulating souls if they encounter
them at their initiation point.  A life mage might specialize in growing
specific kinds of beings, or using the will of souls in the birth stage
while they are still formative.

This kind of interpretation does lead to the question, If life and death are
related to the network does that mean they are not as fundamental as other
sorceries.  I would say on an elemental level the elements of life and death
are not as fundamental as the big size (earth, air, fire, water, light,
dark).  On a sorcery level I would say in epoch two all sorceries were just
will battles anyway.  I don;t think sorceries acquired an elemental
character until there was a universe to have elements in (but then it
acquired it retroactively).  As such I think the life & death sorceries may
have lagged behind the other elements (awaiting the completion of the
recycler) but they are not any less fundamental.

So to recap:

Non-existance means your CGBness is gone (real bad - worse than a ""be not"" -
more liked voided).

Termination and Initiation means reboot and start over - initiated by the
consensus when the rules say you lose.

Life and Death are reality colorings - manipulating them means advocating
the conversations for domination vs. independance.
Life and Death Magics leverage the vulnerability of individuals at the
termination and initiation points (soul magic) as well as their respective
conversations and basic flavored sorceries.

Nature and decay are probably analogous but I will leave them for another
day.
