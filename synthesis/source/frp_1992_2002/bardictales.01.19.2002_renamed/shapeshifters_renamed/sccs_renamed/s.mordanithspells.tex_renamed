\spell
NAME: Mage Battery
DF:  -40
CT: 0.5 hr/(15 points of power to be stored)
COST: 10 + (Amount of power to stored)
DUR:   1 day/rank + linear decay for 1day/rank + 1 day/(12-rank) power
RNG:   0
AOE:  One object

\noindent{\bf Preparation}

This ritual requires a storage reservoir such as a block of
ivory or wood, that has had a rune of power inscribed in it as well
as a power binding performed on it. The power batteries must be made
from one block of material (wood or metal or shell). They are not
destroyed in the process of use and gain a +1\%/20 times a ritual is
successfully cast.

\noindent{\bf Description}

When casting this ritual the caster must choose between three types
of power batteries: Initiation, Continous Support, and Augmentation.

An initiation power battery allows a person to store energy
for use only in casting wizardry rituals. Thus an initiation battery of
40 points power would contribute up to 40 points of power to the
ritual as it is being cast. All stored energy must be used during casting.
The battery is not affected by the discharge. One Half of the stored energy
can be used for Sorceries.

Continous Support Batteries are used by a spell once during
its lifetime.  It supplies power to the spell it is linked to on demand and
prevents the loss of the spell until the battery is exhausted.

Augmentation Batteries are used by the spell once during its lifetime. The
first time the spell or ritual is perturbed or tested the spell takes on all
the power stored in the cell and temporarily gives the attributes of a spell
of power X. X being the power of the battery. The temporary augmentation of
the spell or ritual is one shot and has no effect on the spell it is
supplying. Thus a 10 point ward backed by a 30 point Augmentation battery
when first tested would give the effect of a 30 point ward. The second
testing of the ward would give the effects of a 10 point ward. Any attempt to
dispel the ward will go first against the 30 point warding and if it goes
down it still leaves the smaller 10 point ward.

\newpage

\spell
NAME: MageLock
DF:   -15
CT:  20 Counts
COST:  10 points + 10 points for password option + 1 point/3\% of Negative Door Opening Chance

RNG: \( 4 \times Drive \)
AOE:  One Object that can be fastened

\noindent{\bf Preparation}

The Magelock requires a small amount of some finely powdered
material. Any material that can hold a static charge such as amber or
sulfur should give a bonus to the casting or increase the strength of
the spell.

\noindent{\bf Description}

This spell creates a very tight interweave of Mana force lines that
resist any physical attempt to force them open.  The base resistance
generated is equal to the vision of the mage + 3% per point of power added
beyond the base cost. The Mana lines can be easily broken by magic of almost
any type. 10 % chance of breaking per pt of Mana used on them.  A
Password can be included in the spell. The forces are permanent until
disrupted.

space which has incorporated into any spell the mage may cast. It is
this spell that determines the attributes of the ward. The spell used
can only be used in its primary configuration ( i.e. Lowest point
cost configuration ). Either Mana or physical presence sets it off.
Range of sensitivity is 2' per RNK radius.

{\it THE WARDS MINOR}

8 Equal Sized blocks inscribed with each of the elemental

around any one object. This has the effect of reducing the character's

activate it.

its own.

A funnel will only start draining the battery at the point where the battery
starts its decay or when the battery has been drained by an outside source.

{\sl The spell is designed to be almost impossible to divine out its workings.
A great deal of time and energy went into making the spell difficult to
