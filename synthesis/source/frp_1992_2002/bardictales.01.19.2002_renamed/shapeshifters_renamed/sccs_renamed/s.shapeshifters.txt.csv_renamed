Probably- they could also protect the triggers against random detonation

Ummmm.. noe. Other than that monor detail- oh yeah:
you could have explosively greater results than you anticipate because
any release of power in a Manna Storm can have ""effects"".

Thank you.

Kheldar will give Mordanith the following information (in a Div. warded
location) regarding the Farm Teams and the Magic items:
  In addition to any items that were removed from the Wizard Kings citadel,
any enchanted items that are ""acquired"" by the members of the Monastery or
the Church of Odin are sent to the Isle of Law to be analyzed and
cataloged.  As long as the person's superior has no objections and no
dangerous enchantments are found to be hidden within the item, if the
person that ""acquired"" the item would like to have it, it is returned to
him with any information that was gained about it (if that is appropriate).
 All other items are retained for further storage and analysis.

Although you have access to the ""management"" of each monastery, in order to
discuss magic items for the Farm Teams you will need to either go to the
Isle of Law or the main monastery in Marden.  I suggest the main monastery
in Marden.  Although the process will take longer in the monastery (because
the items are stored at the Isle of Law), the head research guy at the
Monastery has direct experience with many of the items that were recovered
from the Wizard King.  Also, from a Balance perspective, it probably is
better if you don't make a personal appearance at the central location for
the Church of Odin.

By the way, if any of your Farm Teams find items that they want researched,
sold, stored or otherwise disposed of, please feel free to ""direct"" them to
one of the Monasteries.  Although they won't be told that this is the case,
you will be treated as their ""superior"" with regards to decisions about the
items.

    Whatsa matter does Zickmondt not rate getting on the list how
about Noorey-Yef

    actually I have noticed recently that Alex spells it Nureyev
and I spell it Nuryev (Noor Ay Yev vs. Noor Ay Ev).  However it is
all moot because it is really spelled ""arch-hawk over
circlet-rising sun"" which means ""golden gateway to the past (noble

"RE: Shapeshifters","I was thinking of teleports in general, not specifically yours.
And I was assuming we could (somehow) take a few extra chances and
avoid whatever traps we ran into.

However, this environment might not give us those extra chances to
take, and I am not confident of my ability to 'wing it' if things
go wrong mid-port.

..As for SCF, I was under the impression that at least two
mage-types in the party had a lower one than yours, but I have not
re-evaluated since the last system change.  If it's any help, I've

    I was actually referring to myself teleporting out.  In
retrospect this is a bad idea since my brain is the consistency of
oatmeal, but for future reference I have designed a spell with the
same properties as teleport which is specifically designed to be
non-trappable (Falstaff probably has a similar version given the
way he blips about).  I sometimes feel I am overlooked in these
capacities being one of the lower SCF members of the party.  Or is
it my diminuitive stature and non-existant aura?  Ah well.  Such
is the life of a Fortu, even a self-appointed Fortu deity.

    BTW: Most poetic.

    Jim and I were discussing ways to get out and we came up with a great
solution. Catapult!  We can just fling ourselves through the air and land
with a crashing thump in the middle of Marden.

    But seriously.  Given my current state I would suggest we go with a more
physical approach like high speed levitation or maybe an air bubble rather
than turning into air for me (I don't know how easy it is for a Fortu to
become airy).  Perhaps everybody else could do the air thing and the Fortu
could hop a ride on the back fo Sleppnir.  How fast does she go? Another
possibility besides air form is light form (as Gulliver did when he dropped
by - also probably not easy for Fortu).

    Another more boring possibility is carpet to Kiev (or one of the nearby
Dao-Shoa cities and Library it from there).  According to the map Techen
(the closest city) is about 100-150 miles away (150-225 km).  How fast does
a carpet go?  Could we make it there in under 3 hours (50mph)?  What would
we have to dodge along the way?

    BTW:  Speaking of the map Alex, where is the city of Usil?  I assume it
is near fire mountain.

        I was thinking of teleports in general, not specifically yours.  And
I was assuming we could (somehow) take a few extra chances and avoid
whatever traps we ran into.

        However, this environment might not give us those extra chances to
take, and I am not confident of my ability to 'wing it' if things go wrong
mid-port.

        ..As for SCF, I was under the impression that at least two
mage-types in the party had a lower one than yours, but I have not
re-evaluated since the last system change.  If it's any help, I've been
feeling inferior with a 56.5.

                                                                -Myth,

            I was actually referring to myself teleporting out.  In
retrospect this is a bad idea since my brain is the consistency of oatmeal,
but for future reference I have designed a spell with the same properties as
teleport which is specifically designed to be non-trappable (Falstaff
probably has a similar version given the way he blips about).  I sometimes
feel I am overlooked in these capacities being one of the lower SCF members
of the party.  Or is it my diminuitive stature and non-existant aura?  Ah
well.  Such is the life of a Fortu, even a self-appointed Fortu deity.

            BTW: Most poetic.

"More escape from reality required","Weeney man strikes again.  I was playing around with my character sheet and decided, just for yucks, to produce a histogram of my number of skills at each skill level.  Having done that I was immiediately compelled to see if there was a reasonable statistical formula which mirrored the general distribution which I happened to have.  Having found that I decided, gee wouldn't this be convenient for generating NPCs.

Of course having had all this fun with math and numbers I will be the first to admit that the following chart is complete crap.  However, knowing that up front it may still be useful.  The idea behind the chart is that you would start at one of two places:
  a.. If you select the highest ranking skill that you want an NPC to have you would look across the second row of the chart until you found that number.  Notice how there are no entries less than six.  The assumption is that freshly generated characters with NO experience could have ONE skill at a rank six.  Having found the correc column you now read down from there and each cell below lists the number of skills that the character will have at that level.  See massive disclaimer below at this point.  Following the skill histogram are three cells which describe the TLF required to have that distribution of skills.  Note that the columns are all setup to describe characters who have one and only one skill of their highest level.  See massive disclaimer two at this point.
  b.. If you select the total TLF that you want the NPC to have read across the row marked TLF to find the largest number less than the desired TLF and then read up the column to find the skill distribution.
MASSIVE DISCLAIMER ONE:  Sigmunds skill distribution looked nothing like the one described here.  The interesting thing was that ON AVERAGE it tracked this distribution fairly closely, the differences tended to sum out to zero and the TLF was generally in line.  One thing in noticed was that Sigmund has slightly more skills at his highest rank than the profile and has a big bump (as a % of the model) at rank ten because it is a nice looking number (something models are bad at modelling).  However the results were close enough that I'll bet it is fine as a quick starting point for NPCs.

MASSIVE DISCLAIMER TWO:  The chart listed below only shows values for selected points and the gaps between these values are rather large.  For example if your TLF is 32 what does this mean?  Well it means you PROBABLY have at least one nine and you PROBABLY do not have a ten but the again you may.  This stuff is only a baseline.

MASSIVE DISCLAIMER THREE:  This whole shebang is based on my experience with Sigmund who is a generalist.  It may be that characters like Dora had a thirteen when there TLF was twenty.  I don't know.

One further step.

Since TLF does not seem to be a terribly informative number for people to talk about I extended the chart to include your primary factor.  To use this you must decide what general model your character runs under:
  a.. Generalist (this is Sigmund) - your primary factor (if it can be called that) accounts for about 20% of your TLF.
  b.. Class based character - your primary factor (if it can be called that) accounts for about 40% of your TLF.
  c.. Specialist - your primary factor (if it can be called that) accounts for about 60% of your TLF.
  d.. Extreme Specialist - your primary factor (if it can be called that) accounts for about 80% of your TLF.
Based on this categorization you can then look up your primary factor and from that derive a TLF and operate as above.  One of the things I noticed (which is consistent with experience) is that at low levels you are really encouraged to be a specialist or you will be useless and at very high levels anyone who is still a specialist would have to have a character sheet that was very strange indeed.

Just as an example Sigmund's highest factor is KIF however being an extreme generalist this factor does not dominate compared to his other factors.  Sigmunds KIF is a little bigger than 118.5 which would indicate by the model that he has a TLF of 69.3.  Well, he doesn't have one that large but it is not off by orders of magnitude so we will skip over that for the moment. The model indicates his highest skill is a 12 (true) and gives rough distributions for his skills below that.  The model does not say which factors these ranks are in so it is no longer relevant whether he is a specialist or a generalist.  The distributions are not exact but are close enough for jazz (+/- < 100%, +/- <33% in many cases).

I have a feeling that the biggest hole in the chart is that PCs tend to have one skill which they consider vital to their character and thus pump up way beyond what any statistical model would predict.  Is this true.  In the example of Sigmund he has had a 12 SCF Perception for a long time now since early on he just rammed eps into it every run becuase he thought it was vital to his character (he has somewhat moved on since then to a slightly broader base).  In the example of Dora above (I think this is accurate) did she have many skills that were way up there or only Ax?

As an interesting question ( and the reason I ran the numbers so high) if Ariock has a 15 sword is he a generalist with a 300 PCF and a TLF up around 150 or is he less generalized with a PCF >400 or is his TLF lower and he (like many PCs) reflects an aberation from a classical waterfall skill model (or is the model crap).

Another revolting question.  Mordenaith, didn't I hear you mention that you had a 15 Abjuration at one point?  Do specialists tend to have a higher highest skill for the same TLF than generalists.  I would believe that.  (For the moment I consider you a specialist, though not an extreme one, Mordenaith).

Anyway.  It all means nothing.  I was just having fun playing with numbers.

  [Jim JM] And I am going to be working on another project with you ?
   
  Sigh...
   
  As for Mordanith, he is not really a specialist (Though I will look at where he falls in your model). Besides, once you add in the 
  changes for elven magic his skill distribution will look very diferent. Dora would be a MUCH better model for a specialist.

Please comment on the divine stuff.  It is focused around Odin

be there.

Now the second half is all about the skills you would need to start
inventing and creating a universe other than the ones your character's

NOTE: These skills are not general purpose or generally known.  If you

has free uses of that batch of skills is Morphus because he has been

This note was a reply to Chris but as soon as I wrote it I realized you
would all be interested in it.

Please comment on the divine stuff.  It is focused around Odin
(obviously).  Is ther eanything missing?  Any other skills that should
be there.

Now the second half is all about the skills you would need to start
inventing and creating a universe other than the ones your character's
ar ein.  Makes you kinda nervous doesn't it?  Please comment.
NOTE: These skills are not general purpose or generally known.  If you
want to use them you need to clear it with me first.  The only one who
has free uses of that batch of skills is Morphus because he has been
trianing and using some of them. (The one exception is the Blend Reality
one in which you all partook with the paladin).  Enjoy!

It is a single skill.  Then there are D: skillsfor each deity.  These
act as a secondary to SDA which is a primary OR they are a primary tro
which SDA is a secondary.  WHichever the player prefers.

Because they are knowledge based.  It isn't a divine action.  It is
knowledge of a series of acxtions, materials and steps that SDA can then
be applied to.  It is a fine line- Wizardry rituals could also be argued
to be INF but I went the other way with them.

I owuld take a seperate skill, but you don't have to- they are related.

These are two SEPERATE skills- they aren't linked.  ONe is ""Create
Yggsdrasil"", the other is a skill of translating one relaity ointo the
context of another.  The two DISC 2 rituals mentioned here would be part
of the DISC 3 Create Yggsdrasil Invokation.

>   Also, Sigmunds ritual was much

NO.  Reality Aggregation was not required because your change only
directly impacted a few dozen local context generating nodes.  It was
east to do as a series of DISC 2 translations then bonded by a DISC 3
spike to have it always have been that way....

That is correct- except much more extreme - you NEED to know the details
or you can never create it.  You ABSOLUTLEY NEED to know what has been,
what is, and what will be to make any permanent change.

I suspect she will wind up with multiple copies, so am not sending one.

[Lara, if you don't have three copies by now, let me know and I'll zap

Ritual Reactions:

Oh my Gawd!

Are you sure?

Get outta here!



Reactions to Ritual:

Well, to begin with, several people are listed as People in the ritual, 
things in the ritual, and (most confusingly) as people to be specifically 
excluded from the ritual.  Could you perhaps clarify this a little?


Also I am assuming Alex agrees with your description of the heartstone.  
(The symbol representing the agreement that there is a consensus... 
sheesh!  I thought Catholocism was convoluted!)


Going back the the Creation Myth (no relation) Alex told us, I think 
Earth/Air/Fire/Water/Power is a much better five-element choice than 
Earth/Fire/Water/Light/Dark.  (There is also a slight personal bias, as 
E-man is a Master of Air, but barely competant in any of the others.)  If 
we were to go to a seven-element plan, I'd recommend Light and Dark then, 
but we'd need more casters, and the troupe is already getting unwieldy.

Note on that Creation Myth (no relation)-- we probably want to mimic that 
when we introduce the elements; it is a powerful resonance and will give 
the ritual an impressive grounding in history, as well as increasing its 
position as 'the way things already are.'  Does someone have an 
easily-accessible copy, or should I try and de-archive mine?


I think the current design may have too stong a dependance on 'Five'.  
While a certain amount of reinforcement is good, and Five is certainly a 
significant number, allowing other elements of the ritual to be distorted 
to maintain the fiveness is not necessarily a good thing.  (Besides, it 
might render the ward vulnerable to a certain other ""Five"", which I would 
count as a Bad Thing.)

I like the five casters (a selection somewhat already made for us) and 
the five elements (the creation resonance is very valuable to a work of 
this nature).  I am less certain of the five support-casters (as you 
noted, they are somewhat shoehorned into spots), the five dimensions (are 
they a complete set?  Alex?), and the five phases (it seems a little long 
and complex for us to handle, when dealing with powers of this magnitude, 
but maybe that's just me).

Five casters: Sigmund, Morphus, Mordenaith, Erithmaeon, Kilsorana
Five anchors: Haalite objects
Five Fortu:   DJan, Darius, Peter, Pentos, Trevaine

Hm.  Given that we have to set up some sort of safety zone (for the 
carpet bag and other wonders), we might want to set up a ring outside the 
ward for defenders.  That would let Arak and Trevaine (hm.. we need a 
third; three is a good number.  Ahmoud?) handle outside threats without 
disturbing the ritual, and leave an in-ritual spot for Drellan.

I would suggect:

Three Phases: Patterning, Substance, Empowerment

Purification would be part of Patterning, Substance would invoke the 
elements in classic Creation order, and Empowerment would set the whole 
thing into motion.

This would necessitate altering the caster-pattern as well. [Boy, does a 
Dorian education come in handy during these discussions!]

Phase 1: Patterning 
 
  A. Primary casters meditate, cleansing their souls (or just sitting and 
humming)
     Secondary casters purify area

  B. Form primary-seconday pairs, using Fortu 'be one with' skill.
     Establish ward zone and safe zone, including non-participating 
artifact storage.

  C. Establish patterns for matter/energy/ward
     Primary element of caster inside proto-ward, secondary element 
outside.
     Each primary-secondary linked to 'their' anchor
     Each primary linked to every other primary
     Each primary-secondary with one non-sapient artifact.

Phase 2: Substance

  A. Each caster calls upon their representative element, in Creation 
Myth order.

  B. Element flows are guided along pattern-lines
     Each element has connections to primary anchor (summoner's) and all 
other anchors

  C. Elements blend and transubstantiate
     Flow pattern becomes one five-fold stream, with five elemental 
resonances.

Phase 3: Empowerment

  A. Elemental power is refined into ward structures, one step away from 
Reality.
     (Note: Reality provided for comparison purposes only.  Your mileage 
may vary.)

  B. Trigger-point is set
     One final element, to bring the ward to realization, is built and 
spell-triggered

  C. Primaries retreat to join secondaries
     Anchors stay at the borders
     Without primary-secondary bond crossing its lines, proto-ward 
pattern completes
     Spell-trigger goes off, proto-ward becomes real ward.


Not quite as elegantly-written as Docto.. er, Jim's, and lacking a number 
of details, but I think a more effective cast, given the limitations of 
the group.

I particularly like the progression of casters. Phase one has ten 
individuals joining to five casters.  Phase two has five casters acting 
in parallel, a kind of seperate but equal thing.  Phase three has five 
casters acting as one.



Whew!

Well, those are my thoughts, at least at the moment.

I strongly agree.  However, one thing that we all MUST discuss before we go
too far with this is what each of our characters believes is the Creation
Myth.  Morphus has two creation stories in his head (so far, <grimace>).
One is that in the beginning there were five Wills which (to make a long
story short) represent Earth, Fire, Water, Light, and Dark.  In this
reality, Air IS made of Light and Dark.  Nature and Life are made with
Light as a base and maybe (chris doesn't know, morphus might) Earth, Water,
Fire and/or Air.  Death is made with Dark as a base with the same caveats.
Decay either does or does not exist (it did once, but I think Alex may have
rethought its addition).

The other involves a primal will, the Uncreated and Unseen, from which the
Five were created.

I have a full copy of the story as I received it.  I will send it to anyone
who is interested, but I suggest that you get ""your version"" from Alex.

Please understand that considering what we are going to be doing, and the
fact that we will not be doing anything else with reality while doing it
(Pook and Alex talked me out of some rather complex stuff that would have
had a side effect of eliminating the Linking Ward), it won't just be
Morphus letting us into the Heartstone chamber.  The other three surviving
creators of the Ward will be approving the procedure that will be carried
out prior to the ritual being cast.

1. I was not aware of this.

2. If anything, this make my point even more valid, at least to me.  The 
Five (in their various combinations) have proven to be very clever, 
aggressive risk-takers (at least in others' eyes), and quite able to work 
their way around restrictions that they don't agree with.  In the 
interest of removing temptation, I would prefer to keep things as simple 
and secure as possible.  I am sorry for anyone who hasn't yet had a 
chance to remodel Reality to their liking yet, but one must draw the line 
somewhere.

"Re: Ritual","OK Ritual people....

   I liked the write up but I agree with Myth that we have to look at the
dynamics of the elements.  If they are as they should be great.  I think that
we should stick with the pattern of five and I like the Fortu assignment as it
has been laid out.  Even more security would not bug me.  I could offer Wei-
Lee and Amud as physical guards outside of the ritual if we think that may be
necessary.

   I will craft my portion according to the instructions laid out by Sigmund.

Subject:	Re: Ritual

What do you mean when you talk about the ""four Haalite Anchors""?


Are you talking about the four dodecahedrons that are tuned to
Rismaeon, Logos, Falstaff, and Kheldar?  If so, I had not thought of
these as anchors as much as Keys along with your Halite Rod.  
>>Yes this was what I was thinking of.  You are correct, I should refer to them as keys in the ritual.


How much of this description did Alex give you as downloaded from the
ward?
>>None,  I have a bunch of stuff but I was just making up what it looked like.

Who did you determine told you that EARTH, AIR, FIRE, WATER, POWER was
going to create a balanced ward and how did they say these elements had
to be combined/utilized to do so?  My original plan called for
utilizing 20 tuned dodecahedrons in groups of 5 in a dodecahedral
pattern around the Heartstone tied together with Chronomancy.  Please
elaborate on the differences from my ritual to yours.

>> I have been out of the country and unable to pursue the element question yet.  I completely forgot about the
twenty vertices.  This should be in the ritual,  I tried to incorporate chronomancy in the temporal dimension. If you
have some ideas about how to make it better mail me some text.


Balance is a word which implies a frame of reference.   In the frame of
reference that I am using, Earth, Water, Fire, Light and Dark are equal
powers and balanced.  Are you casting a ward which has strength only
within the Vortex (the stuff within the Ward of Light), which has
strength within the Ward of Air (all of reality between the Earth and
the Void), or which has strength within the entire reality structure?

>> Within the entire reality structure of course.  I am flexible any way you want. You get everyone to agree
and I will ask alex about my source.

What are your skills in W:Earth?  Does it make sense for you to be
casting Earth Magics?

>> Earth magics are my strongest magery (after will stuff and abjuration I suppose). I am a rank 7 Geomancer as 
well as having rank 3 in D:Earth.  The other elements which I would be good at are Power (if we use that) in which I
am rank 8 or 9  or Dark if we use that (In which I am only rank 2 or 3.


What is ""power""?

>> According to Alex In the Earth, Air , Fire, Water, Power element theory power is the raw material from which the 
other elements are shaped by the primal wills (this may have been butchered).  This is still a matter of sources.
 
I don't agree that space and time should be seperate.  Space and time
are merely two descriptors for dimensional terms, as is planar phase,
which you left out.
>> This sounds like a reasonable point.  Perhaps we can combine this with the de-emphasis of 5 which Myth
was suggesting and combine space, time and planarity into a single role of dimensionality.

<fontfamily><param>Times</param><bigger>>the caster in this role will
maintain the conversation that the symbolic warding of the object which
is the symbol of >consensus will result in the symbol of consensus no
longer being accessible.  This role determines the conversation of
>applicability that is required for the manipulation of a symbol.


</bigger></fontfamily>Huh?

>> This is my attempt to address in some language the idea that the thing which we are operating on is
a symbol and not an object.  As with any symbol, however, it has a symbolic nature and a manifestation.
Somehow we need to include the notion that we are isolating the symbol of the consensus and not just 
the current manifestation (container?) of that symbol.

I'm a little concerned about your assistants.  You have a lot of Fortu
in the room.  That makes me nervous in view of the recent changes and
the fact that the Fortu aren't all bound to individuals (other tha
other Fortu).  If anything, Trevain, who is entirely non-magical (or
was before this) should remain out of the Heartstone room, guarding. 
D'Jan should also be outside.  No Divine elements can enter this area. 
He would be most effective in the doorway itself.  Darius - He was
tainted.  Are you sure that he is not in this reality?  You also need
to find out what Falstaff, Logos and Rismaeon are going to be doing. 
If I don't eliminate the Ward at the same time as we do this, they
*must* be dealt with.  Don't forget, they OWN the access to the
Heartstone, Fortu don't. (or didn't)

>>Now I am confused?  Many people have suggested that Trevaine is 
unnecessary in the ritual.  We should move him to act as security on the 
periphery.  What do you mean that no divine elements can enter this area?
Is this a physical impossibility?  Will Mordenaith be able to enter at all?
If there is no possibility of divine presence what is the basis for this?
When was Darius tainted?  What do you mean am I sure he is not in this 
reality.  Also, we definitely need to deal with the other four and the ward
both of which we were already incoporating in the ritual. 


Please be aware that we don't want to have too many entities in the
presence of the Heartstone.  The Heartstone helps to define the ""space""
around itself.  I don't know what will happen when we make it go by-by.
 I wouldn't want to wait at the end of a line of entities trying to get
out of the door.

>> Noted, what do you think would be the ideal number?


My concept for this involves isolating the symbol of the consensus by
utilizing a balanced subset of the basic essence of Reality (not just
the Vortex) to squeeze the symbol outside of reality into the Void
(actually into its own pocket reality).  This will have the effect of
removing it from the minds of everyone in the current reality
(including the castors) except for the Five Wills (who don't move at
our level and the five entities that are Keyed to the Keys that Key the
door shut.  These five will have to retain knowledge so that we can
continue to repair the machine and return the symbol when it is
necessary.

>>  I agree completely that we need to produce a reality bubble which
is as fundamental to the nature of reality as possible.  I think we only
differ on implementation.  I am fine with building the ward out of whatever
stuff we can slap together,  I think we just need consensus on that. I 
do however think that the castors are much more likely to ""remember""
the previous reality than most other entities.  I also hope that you are not
expecting one hundred percent coverage (although I think that the concept
behind the ritual makes enough sense so that most people who can save
will still back it).

It is NOT a holographic matrix of everything- it is a symbol- not the thing
itself.It is a mirror that reflects back the consensus and thus keeps the world
in
that consensus.  Not an easy distinction.

Not quite.  Air was created first by the Destroyer and the Starchild
workingtogether.  Then the Destroyer created Leknud- a force
that moved through air to dominate air to the Destroyers will.  In response
the
Starchild created Thcil- a force that moves through Air to combat Leknud.
Leknud and Thcil are in a constant struggle for dominance.   They are Light
and Dark.  So although Light and Dark may represent the Two Wills that
created Air, Air is a major element and Light and Dark are not.

Decay was created by the Destroyer to combat Nature which the Starchildhad
created.  Both ""evolved"" into Life and Death with the prompting of the
Two Wills...  both are sourced in Earth, Nature is sourced in Earth and
Water and Light, Decay is sourced in Earth and Dark.

That is accurate- this won't stop it/  It will just make it a lot harder.  And it will disable the machine- even if
the machine were fixed.

"Re: Ritual","<fontfamily><param>Geneva</param>I'm sorry if I seem like I'm going
back and forth, but I have more information from Alex that has caused
me to go back to some of my original plans/concepts.  This message was
mainly directed towards Pookie, but I realized after I wrote it that it
would save time if everyone else read it too.


Regarding participants:

We MUST have more discussion on our creation myths and the element
baseline.  When I explained to Alex what the term ""reality"" encompassed
for me, he agreed with me that EARTH, FIRE, WATER, LIGHT, and DARK were
balanced in that concept.  Without further discussion we can't come to
agreement on the elements; without agreement on the elements, we can't
plan the procedures or who will carry them out.  Please lets discuss
this further.


I don't see a lot of elemental magic being cast during this process.  I
see using the elemental tuned nodes as the 20 vertices that I outlined
in our original discussions, but nothing more than that.  Willworking
and Abjuration (Shaping, Binding AND Warding) would play a much more
important role.


Although we (and I) won't be making any castings besides the isolation
ritual, and therefore Dora and the Hammer won't be required as I had
earlier suggested, I think that the 4 Dwarves are still a good idea. 
They would be much better anchors than the Halite.  I'd actually place
them within the boundary of the Ward construct while we build it.  They
would act as a stabilizer, utilizing Enforce Reality where necessary. 
I think that this is especially necessary since we will have two elves
participating in the ritual.  Also, entities within the Ward isolation
radius probably won't make it out.  And I am fairly certain that I know
just where to get 4 dwarves that would take that chance.


Regarding the Fortu participation:

I did not mean to imply that D'Jan was divine; only that since his
skills are in the divine area and divine magic can't be cast within the
boundaries, the portal between the restricted area and the outside
would seem to be the perfect place for him.


Peter, Drellan, Pentos:  I think that each of them should be involved.


D'Jan	I think that D'Jan should initially sweep the area but then take
station as I outlined above.  I think that he is best utilized just
handling the responsibility for detecting and limiting divine
interference in the ritual.


Trevaine	should not be involved with the ritual AT ALL.  He and Arak
would work with us IF we need to fight off the Battle-Ghosts (TM), but
then they should be posted outside to prevent interuption. The dwarves
would be better at providing a firm grounding in the reality integrity
of the casters.


Darius	If you are sure about Darius in terms of reliability, I agree
that I would like to have him assist.


Some changes from previous messages:

I had talked about people forgetting about the Heartstone as a result
of the ritual.  Also about the machine and the Linking Ward not
existing as a result of the ritual.  This would only be if we did a
Discipline III.  I discussed with Alex the consequences of such an
action.  Although Alex said that he could be prepared for it, Chris is
not (and therefore Morphus is not).


</fontfamily>My concept for the ritual still involves isolating the
symbol of the consensus by utilizing a balanced structure of the
components of Reality (not just the Vortex); squeezing the symbol
outside of Existence into a pocket reality 'blister' between Existence
and the Void. 


<fontfamily><param>Geneva</param>The Linking Ward would exist in any
case because Nuryev could have created it without creating the machine.
 The machine would not have existed and therefore nothing that we did
with the machine would have occured.  There have been a lot of things
done with the machine.  I (chris) was just not willing for the turmoil
that that would produce for us and our characters.  That brings us back
to Discipline II which says that it doesn't exist but it used to.  Thus
everything that was done will still have been done. 


With the Symbol not permanently out of reach and the machine on its way
to repair, as long as the Isolation Ward is Keyed as we discussed, I
don't see a problem with the rest of the creators of the Linking Ward.

"RE: Ritual","Well, it seems that E-man and I are WAY behind on our remedial cosmogeny. 
 Lacking specific knowledge of the Vortex, the Ward of Light, and all 
that ilk, I'm going to have to fall back on my more general knowledge of 
reality, and a feel for what makes good ritual. (Benefit of a Catholic 
upbringing.)

Here are my major requests for the ritual:

1) Not too complex.  The descriptions for this event seem to have every 
sign of running amok, burying us in minute detail and making us lose 
sight of the ultimate goal.  Besides, complicated things have loopholes.

2) No loopholes.  Alex has advised us that any spell distancing the 
Heartstone from the World will eventually decay.  I see no need to hurry 
the process, or risk it happening with catastrophic suddenness, rather 
than a natural slow rejoining.

3) Too many people/influences is bad, at least for the sort of thing we 
are doing.  A dozen people is pushing it, unfortunately including guards. 
 (A turb of grogs, anyone?)  I don't think we can make any sort of 
racially balanced package out of this; we'll have to simply describe 
everyoe as 'people of power who care', and hope that's representative 
enough of sentience in the World.  OTOH, I like the idea of a Dwarf in 
the mix; they are stronly representative of a solid, non-magical element 
that we are otherwise lacking.

4) I don't want to leave anyone behind.  I realize that some sort of 
sacrifice is needed, but tossing entire sentients into the binding 
strikes me as a bit extreme, as well as the sort of thing that could come 
back to haunt us later.  I would propose instead each of us sacrificing a 
point of personal POW to the spell, instead.

5) I don't want people poking holes in the new ward as they depart, 
either.  I would propose two ways around this:
  A - Have the casters as mage-Fortu pairs, with the mages in the 'zone' 
and the Fortu outside.  At the appropriate time, the mage retreats to the 
Fortu.  Rather than creating a hole in the structure, we would be 
removing a barrier to completion.
  B - Use one of Kilsorana's spell-triggers (on a slightly massive scale) 
so that the ward is not actually in existance until after we depart.

6) I'm still in favor of using the power-building phase to mimic the 
magical/elemental pattern of the World, establishing a 'comfortable' 
environment for the Heartstone as we pack it away.  Creation Myths, 
however, seem too complicated a matter to settle quickly; we'd probably 
be better off letting sleeping myths lie, and sticking to secular 
elementalism.

Are there 13 of these groupings?  As in, this is the same question that I

Ummm.. theis spell is too big to use one of Kilsorana's spell triggers
unlessall it was doing was holding a pinhole open for people to escape
through.

Well, at a bare minimum, it will distract people from killing you before 
your incipient godhood, and will 'lock in' (at least to a greater extent 
than now) your Odin-potential.

It will also protect you from some of the machinations (pun intended) of 
the rest of the Five, who seem more content than you to hang out at the 
Machine all day, and who (collectively) may be more clever and insidious 
than you.

It will reduce the occurrances of such surprises as the Living Fortu 
trick, where someone else shifts reality, and doesn't bother having you 
sign off on the paperwork.

It will give you a little more insight into the way the rest of 
Shapeshifters work, should you find yourself wanting to manipulate or 
oppose them later.

It's really good for your reputation to do things like this and live, and 
all the mage-groupie babes will know your name.

Thanks, Myth.  Especially for that last one.  Of course, any babe who would
really be impressed isn't likely to understand what it was that we did, and
the ones who do understand will probably be pissed that we did it but maybe
Madra or Dream will turn their interest from Kay to Morphus ....

"RE: Falstaff","Excellent,
	I am glad that Falstaff called because  I was just in the process of deciding when in the time stream I should talk
to him, Logos and Rismaeon.  It doesn't matter to me whether he approaches me first or me him.  I finally decided I am  
going to talk to each of the five (excluding Nuryev) a week or two before execution of the ritual.

To:	Jim Jackl-Mochel; Jim Wilson

Subject:	Falstaff

Falstaff gives you both a  call.   He asks you how things
are going and then he pauses...

So... I was just talking with Morphus.  He has let me know
about your plans to isolate the heartstone.  I have some concerns:

(1) I think the warding should be openable by all the keys currently
extant in the aggregate reality.  What if one gets destroyed?
So if there are only four keys left then four will open the ward.
Three-three.  Etcetera-etcetera

>> Absoultely, good idea, I incorporate it.

(2) I think you should build in a natural decay of about 5 - 10  years
so the Heartstsone will automatically free itself.   Here is why -
the Lich's reality is the strongest reality generations outside of the
God_King's in the world.  As the heartsone dissappears his reality
will have the dominance and will start to grow.  Although i agree
in the SHORT TRERM that the heartstone should be sealed I think
the longer it stays sealed beyond the necessary the moire powerful
the Lich will become.   I am committed to limiting that.

>> Absolutely, good idea.  I had already intended in the ritual that the decay
effect of the heartstones's influence eventually overpower the wards ability
to power itself however I was thinking on the order of 100 years.  I will change
it to 5 years based on your recommendation.

(3) I think we should let Morphus go ahead with his plans for the
Dwarves.  They will provide a solid reliable Earth-basis for the whole
thing and it will make Morphus easier to deal with.  He is much better
now that he doesn't think he is Odin anymore!*phew*  That was a
rough period.

>> Okay.  Whatever floats peoples boats.

(4) Watch for Rysmaeon- he is agaisnt the sealing and thinks it is a bad
idea.
I odn't think he is wasting much iutme on it- but if he sees a
convenient
opportunity to meddle he will take it.

>> What is iutme?  Is this some strange new form of magical energy?  And do
you honestly think I trust Rismaeon farther than I can throw him (which is 
aproximately 12 feet with a good sacrifice throw and I don't even trust him
that far).

(5) Logos and I are coming.  We will just watch thank you.

>>Okay, sounds good to me.  I am assuming that you will watch from outside the
ritual area.  Would you mind assisting with external security since you are going to 
be their anyway?  You can never be too paranoid and I don't think Lenore or Balder
are going to show up out of the blue this time.

Any questions or comments?

>> Just to remind.  My strategy now is to find out about everything which could affect
the ritual, be aware of it and prepare for it/integrate it into the ritual/develop contingencies.

I will probably not be able to come over to you place tonight.  Andrea sounded terrible
this morning and she will probably not go to her SELP.  I think I should take care of her.
We should strategize about what needs to be done before Saturday AM and how we can
handle it.  If you guys still want to meet I could call in by phone.  The things I want to 
accomplish before Saturday are:

1.	Talk to Falstaff, Rismaeon and Logos
2.	Be present if people talk to Nuryev, otherwise don't worry about it
3.	Get everyone aligned on the ritual
4.	Take care of anything else which would prevent us from starting the
	walk towards the heartstone first thing Saturday AM.

By the way, I am assuming the run is at your place (or Jim's?).  What Time?  10:00AM?

Please mention if there is anything to do for #4.  I am having a tough time at work and so
I may not have a physical rewrite of the ritual but if I do not I am going to just say ""I have rewritten
the ritual and incorporated people's comments"".  Is that OK?

* This is being handled by ICQ, e-mail, lunch meetings, and tonight.

(2) Morphus wants to go to the Island of Law and recover the Staff of
Law.

* This will either be run as a half-hour snippet during the run on
Sunday or handled tonight by Jim and Chris.

(3) Morphus wants to get the four dwarves he and I have been talking
about to join the ritual.

* I will let this just happen and not run the details.  It is done.
Chris:  Please name the Dwarves and tell me their skills.

(4) We need to get the details of the casting organized.

that the design stuff that some of us (like myself) love so much be
moslty complete by Staurday so Saturday be more of a problem -solving

all with me in that?

(5) We need to decide what NPC are going to the Heartstone.

See below.  This is an important question.

(6) Mordanith, Kay, and Sigmund have been talking about going back in

ACK!  SPITTLE!  GASP!  Please contact me if you guys are going to do
this.  It will be hugely interesting if you suceed and it will entertain
EVERYBODY.  It is an in-run action, not out run.  But
if you do it people will not be bored..:-)  HGoweve rthis is abig deal

Okay- back to question Five:

Here is the list of People who have been mentioned as possible
inclusions:

Mordanith
Kay
Sigmund
Morphus
Darius
Pentos
Erythmaeon
Peter
Kilsorana
D'jon
Drellen
4 Dwarves
Logos
Falstaff

Arak
Amud Alleth
Kor Keth
Trevaine
Kelthie
Wei_Lee


That's 23 people!  That is a lot.  Do you need that many?  The othe
rthing is that it will be VERY dangerous!  The trip alone may kill
people.

Supplies Logos will warn you that you need:

At least a weeks worth of food. (it won't take you a week in the prime
but to your characters...)
Climbing gear
Wet weather gear.
Good walking boots or shoes.
Physical weapons
Lanterns and or torches.
Tents/sleeping bags/whatever you would sleep/shelter in at night.

Logos' two biggest warning:
(1)DO NOT ASSUME YOU CAN RELY ON MAGIC OF ANY KIND- INCLUDING ITEMS.
(2) DO NOT TAKE ANYONE THAT CANNOT DEFEND THEMSELVES OR HOLD THEIR OWN.

Please send Alex any comments or thoughts as soon as possible.

Okay all.  Here is my official consolidation post.  Please respond with
your comments.

The date of Shape Shifters is this Saturday, November 1st.
Location: My place
Time: 10:00 am  until we are done.   I am committed that we get the
Heartsone sealed- or not- this run.  I am targeting 7:00 as the end time
of the run.

Players: Lara, Myth, Jim Jackl-Mochel, Jim Wilson, Chris, and quite
possibly Jack.
Did I miss anybody?

>> Jim Wilson will not be in attendance.  His character will be played by Jim Everett-Wilson.

I am going to list things that people have told me that they want to
do.  In this I will include information that is not generally public
knowledge but that I think we have to manage as a group because our time
is limited...I will not reveal any of your secret plans to conquor the
universe.  I have five major things that need to be handled as far as I
know.

(1) Mordanith and Sigmund want to talk to each of the Five.

* This is being handled by ICQ, e-mail, lunch meetings, and tonight.

>> Sigmund does not think it is necessary to travel through time to talk to Nureyev.

(2) Morphus wants to go to the Island of Law and recover the Staff of
Law.

* This will either be run as a half-hour snippet during the run on
Sunday or handled tonight by Jim and Chris.

(3) Morphus wants to get the four dwarves he and I have been talking
about to join the ritual.

* I will let this just happen and not run the details.  It is done.
Chris:  Please name the Dwarves and tell me their skills.

>> I am curious as to who they are and where they come from.

(4) We need to get the details of the casting organized.

* Some of this will occur tonight and be done by e-mail.  I am committed
that the design stuff that some of us (like myself) love so much be

>> Given that response I change my position from mildly against to violently opposed.

Okay- back to question Five:

Here is the list of People who have been mentioned as possible
inclusions:

This should be split up as inside the active ritual area:

Mordanith
Sigmund
Morphus
Darius
Pentos
Erythmaeon
Peter
Kilsorana
D'jon
Drellen

A suggestion was made that D'Jan be outside the ward since Divine presence is
impossible within the presence of the heartstone.  If this is true I would be convincable
although I always like having him around.  I have no evidence that this is true however
and unless such evidence is provided I (being the paranoid person that I am) think it
is essential that we have him present to prevent divine influence or manage it if it is 
present.  Even if no random shape shifting gods sneak into the ritual disguised as 
someone's belt buckle there are at least three characters present who could spontaneously
emit divine energy in the presence of a wild magic like mana hurricane.

And outside the active ritual area (I am not sure whether you wanted the dwarves as casters or
supporters Chris) but in the heartstones presence:

Kay
4 Dwarves
Logos
Falstaff
Trevaine (I think we need only one gaurdian we could probably leave Kelfi)
Arak

People I would rather leave behind:
Amud Alleth
Kor Keth (Not to discriminate against him but I hadn't thought he would be interested)
Kelthie
Wei_Lee

I think we should evaluate whether Amud could make it without assistance.  I feel the same
about Arak and Wei Lee but I have a little more confidence in their ability to deal with strange
magics and bizarre environments.  I originally was thinking to not bring Kor'Keth or Kelfi to keep 
the numbers low.  If we are bringing a lot of squishies we might want to include them so that
they can act in bodygaurd roles.  I would rather keep it small though.


That's 23 people!  That is a lot.  Do you need that many?  The othe
rthing is that it will be VERY dangerous!  The trip alone may kill
people.

Supplies Logos will warn you that you need:

At least a weeks worth of food. (it won't take you a week in the prime
but to your characters...)

Physical weapons
Lanterns and or torches.
Tents/sleeping bags/whatever you would sleep/shelter in at night.

Logos' two biggest warning:
(1)DO NOT ASSUME YOU CAN RELY ON MAGIC OF ANY KIND- INCLUDING ITEMS.
(2) DO NOT TAKE ANYONE THAT CANNOT DEFEND THEMSELVES OR HOLD THEIR OWN.

>>Interesting.  When this suggestion is made I might ask Logos what the source of his information is.  Has he been there?

Please send Alex any comments or thoughts as soon as possible.

Oh I that's too bad.  I think Jim Wilson is a much better actor... ACK!  Blood squirts as Alex is suddenly attacked from
behind by Andrea and disemboweled.. .ARGHH!:-)

Again Logos will speak.

""The prohibition against Divine beings is simply that the heartstones will turbuliunce is such that any connections to outside
sources will be severed or severely damaged in the prescence of the Stone.

""Lord Paladin Kay should be fine because of the strength of his Bonds though he shouldn't enter the ritual area itself.
I recommend against him- points to Arak- as his connection is weak enough that it will probably be violently severed in the
prescence of the Stone.    All of the Fortu net connections will also go down- though as long as they are shut down first it
will cause no damage.

> And outside the active ritual area (I am not sure whether you wanted the dwarves as casters or
> supporters Chris) but in the heartstones presence:

I believe Chris wanted the Dwarves in the ritual area itself as a counter balance to Kilsorana and Mordanith.(Logos approves
of that BTW)  By the way Pook:  I gave you bad numbers at lunch.  Morphus contribution to the spell design is only 40 design
points.  My apologies.

Kor Keth is not interested but willing if you want him to go.

> Kelthie

Kelthie would just a soon return to his mission for Dora.

> Wei_Lee

Same with Wei-Lee.  Very busy but willing if Kilsorana wants him to go. Lara?

> I think we should evaluate whether Amud could make it without assistance.

Amud is actually quite the warrior.  he is an extraordinary fencer, but doesn't have many skills for dealing with magical
threats except a killer psi-shield Kilsorana has been teaching him...

Logos has been to the Heart Stone 3 times.  He is the current world expert on the Heartstone/Machine Interface and has never
been to the Heartstone in this reality.  He expects the terrain and challenges to be quite different.  He does however
understand the defense's topology and the design of the creation of the defenses....

universe.  I have five major things that need to be handled as far as I

>> Thanks for keeping my secret.  The rest of 'em won't figure it out for
years, anyhow.


(1) Mordanith and Sigmund want to talk to each of the Five.

* This is being handled by ICQ, e-mail, lunch meetings, and tonight.

>> Fine by me.  I trust Sigmund's judgement.


(2) Morphus wants to go to the Island of Law and recover the Staff of
Law.

* This will either be run as a half-hour snippet during the run on
Sunday or handled tonight by Jim and Chris.

>> Another artifact?  I hope we're having a charity auction or something
afterward, cause the mystic wheelbarrow's getting a little full.


(3) Morphus wants to get the four dwarves he and I have been talking
about to join the ritual.

* I will let this just happen and not run the details.  It is done.
Chris:  Please name the Dwarves and tell me their skills.

>> No.  I got burned once on the Rainbow Monastery deal, and I WILL NOT
blandly let Morphus add people 
to the ritual without knowing a litlte about  them and why they are needed.
 (NEEDED, not just nice to have.)  
Call me paranoid, if you like, but I this smells like one of Morphus'
Clever Ideas (patent pending), and I'm not in the mood to get betrayed
again.

>> If either you or  these guys betray us, Morphus, I will see you dead.


(4) We need to get the details of the casting organized.

* Some of this will occur tonight and be done by e-mail.  I am committed
that the design stuff that some of us (like myself) love so much be
moslty complete by Staurday so Saturday be more of a problem -solving
and Adventure run than a theory/design the spell sort of run.  Are you
all with me in that?

>> Sounds good.


(5) We need to decide what NPC are going to the Heartstone.

See below.  This is an important question.

>> Agreed.  This is NOT a parade event.


(6) Mordanith, Kay, and Sigmund have been talking about going back in
time to talk to Nureyev.

ACK!  SPITTLE!  GASP!  Please contact me if you guys are going to do
this.  It will be hugely interesting if you suceed and it will entertain
EVERYBODY.  It is an in-run action, not out run.  But
if you do it people will not be bored..:-)  HGoweve rthis is abig deal
requiring major but-in form deities and will be difficult and
dangerous.  Do you want to do it?  Jack? Jims?  Is it worth it?

>> Sounds like a major detour to me.  I'm against it unless it is vital to
the ritual.


Okay- back to question Five:

Here is the list of People who have been mentioned as possible
inclusions:

Mordanith
Kay
Sigmund
Morphus
Darius
Pentos
Erythmaeon
Peter
Kilsorana
D'jon
Drellen
4 Dwarves
Logos
Falstaff

Arak
Amud Alleth
Kor Keth
Trevaine
Kelthie
Wei_Lee


That's 23 people!  That is a lot.  Do you need that many?  The othe
rthing is that it will be VERY dangerous!  The trip alone may kill
people.

>> Arak is a paladin.  Will this cause problems?  Also, I don't really want
to bring the ENTIRE World population of Fortu.. it seems somehow excessive.
 My opinion on the Four Dwarfs is stated above; I would feel better without
them.  Why are we including Falstaff?  Do we need him?  Can we spare him
from all the other World-shaking meddling he usually does?  ...And it's
spelled ""Erithmaeon"".

Supplies Logos will warn you that you need:

At least a weeks worth of food. (it won't take you a week in the prime
but to your characters...)
Climbing gear
Wet weather gear.
Good walking boots or shoes.
Physical weapons
Lanterns and or torches.
Tents/sleeping bags/whatever you would sleep/shelter in at night.

>> I can get all that, even assuming non-magical good-quality (durable and
lightweight) stuff.  I would also like to add a change of clothes for the
ritual, appropriately sealed against whatever magical mayhem we may
encounter on the way.


Logos' two biggest warning:
(1)DO NOT ASSUME YOU CAN RELY ON MAGIC OF ANY KIND- INCLUDING ITEMS.
(2) DO NOT TAKE ANYONE THAT CANNOT DEFEND THEMSELVES OR HOLD THEIR OWN.

>> Since E-man has no magical items (thank you very much, O Collectors of
Artifacts), he doesn't care about the first one.  And he has been training
to qualify for the second part, in between the rest of his life.


Please send Alex any comments or thoughts as soon as possible.

>> Hokay. 

                                -Myth.

Great.  That seems to be universal.

Okay- that is done then.  Unless Kay insists we aren't going to do that!

Your sentinal will, of course come.  It is up to Kilsorana if Wei-lee comes or not.

No.  It is unlikely that they will survive in Logos' opinion.

> Are any particular types of weapons desirable ?

No one knows because no one knows what is actually out there.

> What level of magic items are likely to be useless ? Potions, Triggers, Scrolls, Artifacts ?

ALL.  No exceptions.   Oops!  Not true:  Sentient, context-generating items will still work:
elves, the Fortu, mistslicer (though she would have no magical powers, be unable to communicate
and essentially be a hunk of weak silver), basically just the elves and the Fortu.

Certain alchemical and thaumaturgic magics that operate at a very fundamental level may still
work.  MAY!

"Reminder","Hi Guys & Gals,

	I don't have much time but I was just reading through e-mail and I realized that no
one had replied to one of my original requests.  In order to have the ritual have any chance 
of success at all we all need to know every single person who is going to be in the ritual area
and every single thing they will have on them.  I think it would be important to know at least 
which people will be in the ""viewing area"" but I will let this go for the moment.

Therefor from every person I need two things:
1.	What will you have on your person during the ritual.  List everything including clothes.
2.	I would like everyone to agree that if anybody else brings something unplanned for into
	the ritual no matter how trivial we all force them to leave it in the ""viewing area"".
While this may seem a harsh policy I am just reacting to the extreme delicacy of the situation.

People I assume will be in the ritual area:
Sigmund, Mordenaith, Morphus, Kilsorana, Erithmaeon
Darius, Pentos, Peter, Drellan
D'Jan (still under contention)
4 dwarves (still under contention)

Please let there be no suprises here!

Things I personally will be bringing - 
My Rod
My Necklace of Wizardries
Otherwise I will be naked

Things that will be brought in general
the 20 dodecahedrons
these are the only physical spell components of which I am aware!

Alex, I assume all other Fortu will be naked while in the ritual area.  Is this true?

Encumbrance.  Remember you will be relying on your strength, con, and build to carry things and any
porters are not likely to survive AND likely to be a detriment.  Sooooo...

You can only effectively carry (STR*4 + CON + BLD + WGT/4)/3 with minimal minuses and half that with
no minuses!

That is pounds - we don't do volume in the calculation but i will be harping on volume so beware if
you are bringing  your skis/quarterstaffs, spears, trunks, etc.  I will role-play volume as a
problem!:-)

Rememebr you have to carry all the material components for the ritual as well as your survival gear.

THose if you who are not very physical- be careful- you will be using physical endurance like air and
I recommend those of you who are not REALLY fit to carry below half your encumbrance or pay dearly...

All fortu but Sigmund will be naked.

D'jan will remain outside the ritual area and be listening for divine intervention.

They will agree- reluctantly- to strip off everything but: Their Holy Symbols(which are their foci) and
their staves of office(which are also foci).The holy symbols are adamantium anvils on a dwarven steel
chain link belt.
The staves are ironwood staves keyed to fire and earth and Moradin.

Those are the only ones I am aware of as well.  Logos will recommend that some spell anchors be brought to
mark the edges of the ritual area and to hold the mana turbulence to a minuimum in the ritual area.

A good question.... a Haalite key- without a box- weighs only about a
pound.  However the box to hold it in wieghs about two pounds for a
light box and four pounds for a sturdy metal one.

They are fragile- haalite shatters.  (Alex is being devious here- it
does shatter and is a brittle material but the foot-pounds of impact
necessary to shatter haalite is pretty intense.  But a fall from a
height would do it- so the boxes are probably a good idea!  And the
boxes keep the haalite purified and uncontaminated.

 Relatively serious- you will have to deal with severe emotional
depression and apathy, as well as a complete experience of no grounding
and purposelessness.

You can hold off the physical problems:  fragmentation, decomposition,
etc.  sheerly by setting up a simple, internal ward.  (For you it is a
-50 casting of a ward.  Takes 5 MEN an hour to maintain and you will
have it even in no manna zones since it is internal....  So inother
words- 12 MEX a day.  This will also ease the psychological problems

Hokay.

In the ritual;

1. Erithmaeon.  Unmodified human, Dorian sub-race.  Has been off-plane, 
has been exposed to Wild Magic.

2. Ritual Garb (optional).  Light robe, woven for ritual use and magical 
non-interference. Transported to site in sealed neutral container.  E-man 
is willing to forgo this at the slightest request.

3. Focus (optional).  Silk threads, as magically unflavored as possible, 
for use in laying spell lines.  These will make a 20% difference to a 
number of E-man's magical effects.  He is willing to forgo them at a 
strong request.


Waiting in the lounge;

1. Mage-guild contact ring (optional).  Standard will-malleable item, 
with contact and transport-focus abilities.  Not expected to be useful 
past the first stages of the trip, anyway.  Will forgo at any reasonable 
request.

2. Clothing and camping supplies.

3. Sword (very well-made, non-magical) and Whip (well-made, non-magical, 
but with weaver runes worked into its construction).  The only weapons 
E-man is particularly competant with.

4. A small loom (big enough to make scarves or hand towels), and some 
weaving supplies.  Non-magical.

5. Haalite 'anchor' stone (from the last run; gifted by Morphus) 
(optional)


Hope that's okay.

"RE: Reminder","Thank you,

	I don't think there is any reason that the humans in the ritual be naked.  Also it would prbably be a good idea
if the haalite vertex were in the ritual area, since it is part of the ritual.

I have now heard from:
	Alex on behalf of the NPCs
	Myself (yes I do talk to myself)
	Myth
	Jim JM - verbally (he will bring the chain and nothing else (except I am assuming the haalite vertex)
	Chris - Unknown
	Kilsorana - Unknown

If I do not hear anything from the last two I will assume that they are naked and bereft of possessions (which could be interesting
in the case of Kilsorana - I am a rock, but I am a male rock).  Remember, this is vital to the success of the ritual.  I have
learned recently that the dwarves who are coming with us are going to end up sealed inside the ward.  They are perfectly aware
of this and have volunteered for the assignment.  They are purely for flavoring purposes and there is nothing else being sealed 
in the ward with them.  I have a plan in place to check them out completely from a security perspective (Chris is going to deliver them to me a few weeks ahead of time and I will give them a good check to make sure they are not dopplegangers or republicans or anything scary like that).  In general I think this is a reasonable and safe addition to the ritual and I am usually in favor of other
peoples agendas as long as they are not hidden.

"Re: Morning Ritual Stuff","This is in response to some questions of Pookie's.

JACK:  You cannot wear the Golden armor.  When you enter the no-magic zone it will weigh in excess of 800 pounds.  You won't be able to
move.
You will also have to seal up your connection to Heimdell and Arioch.  When you enter the final level next to the heart stone you will be
injured if you don't.


Those of you at last night's meeting will know some of this- but note- I went over my notes and my Deity design and here is a more realistic
set of numbers- a bit different from what I told you last night.

Pook: Also different than my first pop response to this- these are the accurate numbers!  Please delete and discard the old ones.

This a list of the current reality influence distributions:  Note that they are a little deceptive because there are other factors:  for
instance the percentage is broken up into static/momentum based influence, and active/creative influence.  The Lich's 2% is scary
because it is almost all active creative influence- while the Heimdells, Mardra's and the Tolnian's reality is 95% static reality.

So the first numbe ris the ""amount"" of the relaity effected.  The ""context mass"" if you will.  The next number is the ACTIVE percentage of
that mass that is in momnetum, that is changing and shaping the world reality.  The number after the dash then is the ""influence number""
generated by taking the percentage of the context mass of the relaity and loweirng that to its ""effective number"".
It is really just a ranking .  Notice Heimdell is only 4 and the Lich is 1.9  The Lich has the thrid-highest effective numbe rin the world
and he is in full momentum.  He is gaining a percentage every six months! 

And although Mardra and the New Gods and Faerie all for the most part oppose the Lich- they also waste active points opposing each other and
Hell is on the Lichs side.  They also waste points fighting the Abyss and Hell.   Very confusing and not good for our heroes!  :-)

Heimdell/Bifrost: 40% [includes Arioch, Grey Wanderers, Zen Cha, Dau Penn]<10% ACTIVE- 4>
Mardra/RING: 20% <8% ACTIVE- 1.6>
Tolnian/New Gods: 10%<15% ACTIVE- 1.5>
Hell/Underworld: 10%<30% ACTIVE- 3>
Faerie: 7%<50% ACTIVE- 3.5>
Independant: ~7% [the Elder, some Draconics, No-Rennan, the Outerplanes races, Preceptors, Miriel's people, the Five]<30% ACTIVE- 2.1>
God-king: 3%<0% ACTIVE- 0>
Lich: 2%<95% ACTIVE- 1.9>
Abyss: 1%<100% ACTIVE- 1>
Odin: .03%<80% ACTIVE- .024>

After Morphus' plans with the dwarves and the Staff, the Odin reality will leap up to around 5% of the active reality in five years and and
Faerie will lose 1%, the LICH will lose 1%, and Heimdell will lose 3%.

(2).      About the staff of law
Pookie says:
>         I heard indirectly through Mordenaith that Chris also wants to seal the staff of law inside.  I have never heard any

Chris came up front with this yesterday too.  He told everyone there what he was planning

D'jan is really busy and is working out what Divine problems you might encounter and is
working hard at figuring this out.  He will only provide 10 SRP.

Kor'Keth is not going unles syou specifically ask him too.  Pentos and Peter have slightly
less than you.  Say- 24# of ENC.  D'jan will
have the same.  Drellan will have slightly more- say 40#.

"Magic Items/Ritual","     I didn't expect to have any questions about magic items, but I woke 
up with one this morning, so here goes.

     What about Ironcloth?  I would expect it not to work much of the 
way, but it is not heavy and will be useful once we reach our 
destination, at least if there's combat to be had (and when *isn't* there 
combat to be had with this group?)

     E-man will check with his old master to see what ironcloth is like 
without magic (if the elemental just wanders off, for instance, it's just 
a really expensive silk shirt) and with Logos for possible metaphysical 
side effects.

     If it sounds promising, he will then act as agent for any Shifters 
orders.  (Note- he will *not* be making it himself; prices will be

You know that is agood question.  Iron cloth may actually retain its

No- you see the elemnetal is physically woven into the material so it is not
a spell...I iwll have to think about it.  I am deciding arbitrarily that
Ironcloth is stable enough that it is just like ordinary cloth as far as
rituals go.

We are tryng to limit the number of support personnel because of the

It is if it is contained- but once opened it starts to evaporate rapidly

I'd go with 3 quarts / per person / day of strenuous activity.

    KILSORANA: 15 quarts

How much does a quart of water weigh again, Pook?

Britt says:
Heat matters A LOT!  On a hot day you need a lot more water
 I tend to drink around 2 quarts per /day while hiking and then a couple

more during meals.

I say:
You will mostly be cold and wet.  (drinkable- I don't think so!)

Britt says:
2 lbs. of food is close. Of course, dried stuff takes more water to
prepare.

I say:
There you go!

Britt says:
 My pack for a typical 5-7 day hike weights about 45-50 lbs.  I'd say 10

of that is food and the rest is gear.  Of course I don't carry a sword,
just a Sven saw.  :-)

Subject:	The run

Hello all.

I would like several things:

(1) Opinions on how the run was.  What worked/didn't work, what you
liked /didn't like about:
    - the ambush
@@ Loved It
    - the happy hills level
@@ It was fun and appropriately short
    - the incredible shrinking party level (kudos to Myth for a
Pookie-like getting of the concept really fast)
@@ Lots of fun
    - the hanging bridges level
@@ Frustrating.  Did not like the solution.  On the other hand you always get a certain percentage of this
when doing puzzle runs and I would rather have them then not to have puzzle runs.
    - the donut level
@@ Liked it.
    - the run in general
@@ Loved it.

(2) How are you characters for endurance, etc.   Moredanith and
Kilsorana: important clue:  You know that Physical Exhaustion you THINK
you have been recovering?  Enough said!

@@ I think in order to measure this we need to know at what rate we are burning PEX during the 
run.   I will do calculations for myself based on the following assumptions:

During the ambush (other than my own Speed costs) I burned 1 PEX/30 sec or about 1 PEX

During the tree root level (too short to burn PEX)

During the idyllic landscape level WALKING = 3 PEX/hour for 2 hours = 6 PEX + 1 PEX for a short combat

During the resizing rocks level, I assume that the average expenditure between walking and climbing was the
equivalent to having jogged the whole time so call it 12 PEX/hour for 19 hours (37 total - 18 resting).  During this
period we rested for 8 hours and then again for 10 more.  (Each Fortu only rested for 4 hours).

During the Donkey Kong level I will assume that the same jogging aproximation applies and I have no idea how long
we spent on that level.  I will assume two hours since we did a lot.

During the tubular level I will assume that we spent relatively no physical endurance and I think we were there for
less than 20 minutes so I assume no PEX was burnt.

What do you think Alex?

If all of the above is true then I spent a total of 260 PEX and recovered a total of 128 leaving me with 132 PEX and 
26 Meta-PEX.  Is meta-exhaution typed (like meta-PEX and meta-MEX) or does it apply to both?  Also I am assuming
that meta-PEX is treated as that portion of PEX which is not recoverable except very slowly.  This is rather than an
additional penalty placed in addition to your lost PEX.   Based on these assumptions and considering meta-exhaustion
to be typed I now have 282 out of an original 414 PEND remaining.

Thanks! Feedback is appreciated.

Good plan.

That sounds good.  The elves could recover their PEX and MEx from the ambush.

> During the tree root level (too short to burn PEX)

Agreed.

> During the idyllic landscape level WALKING = 3 PEX/hour for 2 hours = 6 PEX + 1 PEX for a short combat

That sounds good except you spent some of it walking up a hill instead of using the path.  Call it 7 PEX for
non-combatants and 8 PEX for the combatants.

Too harsh I think.  Even though there were frenzies of activity- it was short and often- for the PCs anayways it was
Trevaine hauling them up.   And then the PCs ""resting"" for five to ten minutes!:-) and then there was that horrible
climbing stint.

Soo...

3 PEX per hour for 15 hours(45 PEX), (7 PEX) for the various climbs[I will calculate Dwarves and Trevaine seperately),
20 PEX per hour for four hours(80 PEX) for the climb up the cliff. I have no problem with the elves being pulled up.
Trevaine will haul Kilsoronana up so she doesn't use any(during the climb), and the Dwarves and D'jan will haul
Mordanith up so he doisn't any of those(during the climb).   However Kilsorana- add 4 PEX for all your swimming.

No- I disagree.  Sigmund- you were very active so I agree, Trevaine was too.  Falstaff used a lot of Endurance flying.
Everyone one else just walked and did little jumps and occasionally held on!Sigmund, Trevaine, Falstaff - you could take
20 PEX.  Rest of the party: 10 PEX.

> During the tubular level I will assume that we spent relatively no physical endurance and I think we were there for

1 PEX for the walking around and climbing up bodies ! :-)

Please tell me your new totals.

Both.  Ther eis only META-EXHAUSTION.

That is correct.

Please give me the new numbers.  They should be much better.

The elves are down: 70 PEX - Mordanith
                               74 PEX - Kilsorana.

They are both significantly exhausted and relatively unaware of the severity of their exhaustion.  It will be clear to
the rest of the party.

"RE: The run","I'm gonna wait for the answers to Jim's questions before submitting my own
numbers.  (Though E-man looks much prettier, after I spent all yesterday
working on his character sheet.)  (He is 23, BTW.)  (Maybe 24.  Does anyone
know the date on which we departed?)


As to reviews:

Level 1: The Gate.
     Short and sweet.  Could have been a little longer, twistier, or more
hazardous (perhaps a creature or two, or maybe just a Nameless Dread.. some
reason to hurry) but it *was* just the doorway, after all.

Level 2: The Happy Hills
     A little short, but I think part of that was due to our, um, ""direct""
approach.  E-man was unsatisfied with the elegance of the solution, but
that was a party choice, not a GM thing.  And the greenthieves were not
menacing enough.  Of course, it *is* better to lull your opponent into
overconfidence while drawing him deeper into the trap, and this level was
probably intened to double as a temporary hiding place from magic-based
threats. (I betting Logos did this one.)

Level 3: The River
     A fine level.  E-man felt a little like Chicken Little, but it was a
wonderful threat and barrier all at once.  Kudos also to Kilsorana, without
whom the party would have been much smaller at the end of the level, and
Trevain, without whom we would have been much wetter and more battered.

Level 4: Super Mario Brothers
     An excellent presentation of a video-game level.  Again, a wonderful
threat and barrier at once. Loved the descriptions of the spiny normans and
the ooze-balls.  I, too, was annoyed by the puzzle, but I think that's a
personal thing; it wasn't complex enough to let E-man's patterning skills
really shine.  As frustrating as it was, he enjoyed the challenge.  Nice to
see a little of Falstaff doing the stuff that made him great.

Level 5: Chutes and Ladders
     Nasty, brutish, and short. Nice and devious.  I liked the use of the
people as part of the trap/solution.  E-man's patience is beginning to
fray, and this level was designed to take advantage of that.  In addition,
it is very hard on any water-tuned sorts who might have survived Level 3 in
particularly good shape.  (It looks like there is an elemental progression
going on here; I'll have to review my basic metaphysics if I don't freeze
to death first.)  E-man was shocked by Sigmund's callousness here, and I
expect it is a side of the little guy he hadn't seen before.  I suspect we
may also encounter more problems on the way out because of our actions
here.  

Level 6: Mountains of Misery
     Far too cold.  Another endurance challenge, weakening any fire-types
who might have thrived on the level before.  I'm already trying to figure
out how to wear my tent as a robe, and thinking about weaving mittens. 
Brr!


Anyone got a date for the next run?

"Re: The run","Hi Sweetie,

      I havent had the chance to go through all the stuff about the run but
I have one question. To be fair, would it be right for Kilsorana to take
more exhaustion points from that last level?

     Let me know so I can figure out my stratgy for the next run.

December 13th is out because we are most likely doing the Xmas Carol that
day..Pook - are you going this year?

The days I cannot run in Dec. are  the 6th, 13th so far.  I may have a
holiday party in the evening but I could run on the 20th as well.

Those of us on reflexive shield duty?  I'm guessing 10-15 MEX for E-Man 
on the ambush level, since he did the linking.  Others might have been 
less, with the Abjurational component of the shield getting the 'power 
channel' draw rates.  Alex?

(Very nice, BTW, Alex.  Sorry to have omitted it from my review.  Nice 
display of what happens when word gets out, as well as serving as a major 
distraction/drain for the party.  If we hadn't had Kay, we would have 
been in extremely sad shape for the ritual.  As it is, I am somewhat 
concerned about the mental reserves of our two big guns.)

No time for recovery, though, because we were off too...

Cool.

7 PEX for E-man, then.  Running total; 7 PEX, 15 MEX

But... we rested.  Later than we should have, so I get to play with these 
fatigue rules I just found (I love surprises).  I believe we picked up 
another couple EXT (4) for delaying our nap-time so long.

Subtract out the sleep time (124 EXT for the congregate)

Dunno the benefits of the wafer-meals, so I'm gonna assume they are 
'huge, pasta-like meals' without the side-effects.  That's another 6 off 
(do the elves get that?)

Assuming E-man doesn't acquire an Endurance skill with all the EPs from 
last run (a bad assumption), he is at:

END  90   PEX  57.5  
MEN 323   MEX 307.5

Still in good shape for the ritual, provided he doesn't feel the need to 
go dream-walking, or turn into a griffon or something.

My original analysis assumed that you contributed in an advisory roll but did

"RE: Ritual","I don't think it really matters what your exact chance was, your chance is 
approximately
440 assuming you have about a 250 SCF.  At 2 hours per roll you generate 30 
rolls in
60 hours.  Your success chance translates to an effective yield of 4.4 SRP per 
roll
yielding a total of 132 SRP.  That's disgusting.  Also it is probably way too 
many SRP
with Abjuration as the primary.  Would it work for you to allocate half of your 
rolls
using W:Discipine II as the primary?  This would be much more useful for the
ritual.  The only change would be that your success chance, and hence effective 
yield,
for those rolls would go down a little.  What is your rank in Discipline II? 
 Do
you mind doing this?


BTW:  This would clear up any worries I think I had about not having enough 
bonuses.

I allocated a total of only 60 hours to the task. Ritual Design is an 8 , 
QuickStrike:Ritual design is a
7+ and I used Abjuration as the primary (13+) and Will/Warding as Secondaries 
(10+/10+).

I can't remember what the total chance was.

I will look tonihght,

"Two Notes","Boy, you can tell that my chaos level at work is increasing by the increase
in my gaming related mailings (my favorite stress reduction method).  
Such is always the case just before you go on vacation.

Anyway two things:

Thing One: I sent out a scheduling mail and have heard back from
Myth.  This leaves Alex, Chris, Jackl-Mochel and Lara left to reply.
Also, there is a Voiceworks thing on Feb 28th/Mar 1st which makes
these excellent days for me to game.  I know that sucks for Lara,
sorry.

Thing Two:  I was playing around with Sigmunds character sheet
and I just wanted to confirm a few things with Alex.  In the new world
order I am assuming that the following are the new mods for things:

S:Alter Reality			-150
Generic W:Conjuration Spell	-200?
Generic W:Illusion Spell		-200?
Generic W:Will Working Spell	-200?
Generic W:Divination Spell	-200?
Generic W:Discipline I		-150
Generic W:Discipline II		-300
Generic W:Discipline III		-450

I am a little confused by the fact that the mods for a conjuration you gave
me where bigger than the mods for a Discipline I.  Also, I thought there
was a fifth Wizardry that was affected by the change but I cannot remember
what it was.  Also, what effect does this have on the following:
S:Plane Shift
S:{Random Div Stuff like Identify Item}
D:Plane Shift (The Divine Version)
Ki:Dream Walking

Finally, I had a question about the bonuses you receive from Spell Research
Points.  We researched a ritual for reality isolation.  By doing research we
generated enough SRP to reduce the mod from -400 to -32.  Now if we wanted
to cast the ritual again to isolate something else would the mod be -400 or
-32 for the second cast.  Could we cast the ritual again without having to do
any additional research.  I personally feel that you should be able to cast
the ritual again but the SRP bonus should be lost and need to be re-researched.
Otherwise it seems like there is a play balance issue.

"Two Notes","Interesting points.  I will comment only on the scheduling (1/24 is now
gone for me) and the spell research bonus.

As I understood it, part of the spell research bonus was meant to cover the
specifics of using it at the time and place we used it, and using it on the
Heartstone.  Unless we find some extremely unlikely similar circumstances,
this part should be lost.

Another part of the research was of a more general nature: what is an
Isolation Ward, what factors affect it, what elements or symbols does it
need, that sort of thing.  I could easily see this occupying the same
mechanical niche as the 'free' bonus for having developed the spell, though
I am uncertain of the magnitude of bonus that would be appropriate.

In either case, I feel maintaining the full bonus would be excessively
generous, and maintaining no bonus excessively cruel.  An appropriate range
might be anywhere from 10% up to 1/4 (or even 1/2) the original bonus.

No- I am going to use GMfiat to rule that S: Alter Reality is a -100 still.

the beginning of the God-king's Reign) in the Tharuden calendar, something
like  1300ish in the Dal-Kon Calendar(since the Diaspora), and 1500ish in
the Tolnian calendar(when the city-state of Strichna and Tolna became ruled
by an Emperor).  Now since then I have mad e some abortive attempts at
dating and have probably given contradictory numbers.  Part of this is an
attempt to clean that up and place us in time!

"Re: DATING  ","
Vardigan's leaving home has to be more than two years ago, unless he went 
straight from the castle of that Frankish Countess to the battle with the
Wizard King.  Even then, it has to be more than a year.  Remember he pretty
much walked across the desert and up into the Frankish lands, not counting the
time he spent in the environs of Mardin and with the Gatekeepers.  If we say 
he's been on the road a little over two years total, I think that about works, 
but it's hard to say for certain after so long, and I don't recognize most of 
what's in the list...

He was long gone, but Erak was still there, by the time Shapeshifters made it to
Qasiradam, and I think everyone else had been and gone by the time Pelleas put
in an appearance.  I know Shapeshifters came there after Vardigan had engineered
the collapse of Qasiradam by leading the Qassari hoarde.

There was something up in the Frankish lands by the time Vardigan got there with
his Sun Warrior companion, but of course he went off to help the Frankish
Countess.  When I last actually played him, winter was setting in for real and
they were preparing for a battle at the castle.

I don't know if any of that is helpful or not.

"Time Line (Alex, slightly revised) ","
Dates are Day/Year, where Year 1 = Game Year Vardigan began running.  I do not
know, in the cosmic scheme of things, what year that was.

226/1	Vardigan, Erak, and Mala leave the rest of the party.

227/1	Some rivers forded, one of them pretty substantial.  The hills begin
	to get steeper about halfway through the day, and they see snow and
	mountains, and a firehawk heading west.  Otherwise a quiet day.

228/1	They enter the mountains, talking a good deal about Mordanith and his
	motives.  The party leaves a mark to indicate their passage.
	They encounter a party of Gherka herders.  The night is very
	cold, and Erak has heard tales of ghosts in the mountains.

229/1	The sunrise that morning is strange.  A man they encounter explains
	this is due to the action of the Firelord, and informs them the desert
	is to the east.

230/1	Press on.  Nothing of significance.

231/1	Somewhere, Mordanith and the others are performing their ritual.  The
	sunrise loses its strange quality.

232/1	They stop early in a valley.  A snow creature attacks in the evening.
	Vardigan breaks his scimitar in the fight.

233/1	A day of travel.

234/1	They follow a pass east, past the site of an avalanche.  They pass
	a place where the heads of snow creatures are mounted on poles.  From
	an escarpment, they can see the desert.  They follow the trail to a set
	of 8' steel doors.  This is the entrance to the home of the Gatekeepers
	of The Qeroshae, and they invite Vardigan and Company in.  There's a
	lot of talk about current events, culminating in a discussion of
	journeying to a city in the desert called Qasiradam, and something they
	call The Raising of The Dragon.  A man called Nadi will guide them
	part way, and teach them some of the local language.

235/1	The Gatekeepers provide aid and provisions, including the repair of
	Vardigan's scimitar.  The party descends to the desert.  At a resting
	place, they encounter a Red Sash Assassin, who has apparently been
	dispatched to kill Vardigan.  Vardigan kills the assassin, and takes
	his head for probable payment of a bounty.  The party divides up the
	assassin's possessions.

236/1	Descend further.  The terrain is becoming less rocky.  Nadi is teaching
	a language called Qassari, and some basic rules of behavior in the
	desert.  We come to an oasis in a village.  The head man is called
	Ozar, who asks if we are magicians, and what brings us to the desert.
	He later brings out his grandfather, Odi, and the aprty receive the
	hospitality of the village.  There's an extended discussion about
	swapping the horses for camels, but Vardigan is not interested.  He
	does secure a 4-legged, desert relative of a Gherka for a pack animal.

237/1	Travel into the desert, leaving rocky areas behind.  Begin sleeping by
	day, traveling at night.  They see a great many shooting stars.

238/1	The party encounters a lone man of advanced age in ragged clothes.
	They discuss this event, the Rising of the Dragon, and its possible
	connection to a holy book:

		""Three will come from the north.  A man of power
		 will bring a key and open the gates, so that
		 the Sun Blade may enter and raise the dragon.""

	This upsets Nadi.  Our visitor calls himself Bel, and advises they
	seek out a man called Kofi and tell him 'the hourglass has turned.'
	Bel also has some information about Red Sash Assassins, but Nadi
	continues to dislike him.

	After pressing on, Nadi points out an ancient fortress once occupied
	by wizards.  They pass what might be a caravan, animals drawing carts
	on runners.

239/1	Another oasis.  The caravan is here claiming the water is bad, and
	the party gives up some to avoid trouble.

240/1	The party reaches a set of pillars and turns due east, heading into
	deep desert.  Nadi describes a set of landmarks.  Lightning arcs from
	a nearby hill, striking Vardigan, and people come swarming out of the
	sands.  The party is attacked by a wizard, but a second one named
	Tafir comes.  He identifies our attacker as a Lord of Light Or
	Darkness.  Tafir is a warden in this area.  He bids us farewell and
	moves off, and shifts shape just before he disappears.

241/1	The terrain grows rocky again as they reach a town with a well.
	Vardigan passes out from his wounds, and has to be tended.  He
	overhears discussions that the person who attacked is searching
	for an artifact in holy places in the desert.

242/1	Vardigan continues his recovery.  Juggles some for a village audience.

243/1	The party moves on.  They see lights and chanting that Nadi
	speculates is a funeral.


244/1	Quiet travel day.

245/1	Bad travel day.  The party comes on a Quatu camp.  Quatu are nomadic
	desert dwellers.  The Quatu come out and demand to know what the party
	is up to, and eventually the party is sent on its way.

246/1	Spend time at a well, seeing a caravan and blue flickers of light that
	Nadi cannot identify.

247/1	In the light of false dawn, a desert walker passes.  Nadi identifies
	this as a sort of undead.  They come upon a small camp and a village,
	where everyone is dead.  The dead start walking, and the party flees.
	Eventually, the party reaches Qasiradam and begins looking for Kofi.
	They are apprehended by Sultan's guards, who on learning their
	business brings them to Kofi.  Kofi turns out to be a dwarf.

	Pass the evening at Kofi's house.  He has information about the dragon,
	a force bound by wizards.  Knowledge of it lost in the purge of
	Abjurationists.  He would like the party to speak to a wise man.
	When leaving, the party sees a figure with very long fingers in the
	darkness.

248/1	The day passes quietly.  That evening, the party returns to Kofi's
	for dinner and to meet with the wise man.  There is discussion of
	desert walkers before the wise man arrives.  He is old and very
	withered.

	A discussion of possible connection between the man looking for
	artifacts and the Firelord.  The wise man speaks of a man of air,
	which the party takes to be Mordanith.  Discussion of whether
	Morphus is still alive.  The wise man asks if Vardigan has come to
	raise the dragon.  Vardigan doesn't know.  The wise man, known as
	The Wisdom Of The Desert, says:

		""You are the path, not the walker.  That which
		 cannot be seen can be seen in that which is twice.
		 Your answer may not be here.  Follow gray sand in
		 a sandstorm.  What they seek is not important.""

	More talk, and the sharing of a water pipe.  Kofi advises the
	captain of the Sultan's guard will be on the lookout for
	foreigners, fearing spies.  This discussion is interrupted by
	a disturbance.  Vardigan and Erak pursue and slay two of the
	Sultan's spies.  They agree to meet Kofi again in six days time
	in the desert, where the party saw the tribes gathered.

249/1	Storm breaks out of his stall and leads people a merry chase.
	This commotion attracts the captain of the guard, and Vardigan
	is arrested, but before he can be led off a woman in black attacks,
	bristling with weapons.  Vardigan dismembers her.  She is identified
	as some flavor of witch, and Vardigan is asked to say nothing.

	The commotion with Storm is sorted out, and Vardigan is summoned to
	the presence of the Sultan.  Nadi mentions that the tribes have tried
	to take Qasiradam in the past.  On the way to the Sultan's palace,
	Vardigan passes two Red Sash Assassins, but there is no trouble.
	He's brought to a chamber with minstrels by a dapper man.  The Captain
	of the Guard comes.  Eventually, a man with a thick black beard, the
	third son of the Sultan, comes out.  He holds the title Peacekeeper.
	Vardigan mentions seeing the massed tribes.  Things go black.

	Vardigan has a dream about leading his people against a massed army of
	undead.  He wakes up chained in a dungeon with flowing water.  He pulls
	the chains free of the wall , and wanders through tunnels to make his
	escape, including climbing rocks and going through a waterfall.  At
	last he stops in a cavern to rest.  Another dream of a battlefield,
	his people against Githdani.

250/1	Vardigan manages to get back in the city (after killing two
	shepherds) and checks the corrals.  The animals are not disturbed.
	Then he seeks out Kofi.  The others are at the house of the guard
	captain.  Vardigan's possessions are being sought.  A bounty has
	been posted on him.  That night, Vardigan dreams of Falstaff, and the
	nightmare of undead returns.  In it, Vardigan is wielding a black
	scimitar.

251/1	Hiding out.  The palace was attacked, and the attackers stole bodies.
	There are whispers of treachery naming the captain of the guard.  He
	eventually comes to the house, and gives Vardigan information about
	moving around the palace secretly.  Someone named Nakour is looking for
	Vardigan.

252/1	Vardigan and Erak arrange to meet Nakour, but they are discovered by
	the Sultan's guards and are chased through the city.  They escape with
	the help of the Quatu.  Vardigan is brought to a grotto outside the
	city, where the Quatu are massed.

	That night, Nadi and Mala are brought by Nakoour, and the Wisdom of the
	Desert comes as well.  This blade in Vardigan's dreams is real, and
	it should be in the city somewhere.  It was made by Arioch, and used
	by an ancient king of the Qassari to slay the tribes.  The tribes
	believe Vardigan's coming has been foretold and they are ready to
	exact their revenge.

	Nadi doesn't want to be involved in all this, but Vardigan points out
	he has little choice.

253/1	They are visited by a white man with blond hair.  His name is Simon
	Lefevre, and he is a Frankish mercenary, a Sun Warrior.  He will be
	participating in the impending attack.  Vardigan can get them into
	the city.  That night he leads an expedition to confirm the path.

254/1	There is a terrible battle, culminating in the fall of the city to the
	Quatu.  The Sultan is overthrown and his court is slain.

	In the aftermath, Vardigan meets with the Wisdom of the Desert and
	confers with Falstaff, who confirms the presence of the blade.  It
	is guarded by a trap, a goblin, and a demon of fear.

255/1	The rest of the city falls under the control of the Quatu.  There is
	a great deal of looting.  Eventually, Erak and Vardigan return to the
	city to find the Quatu leader.  They will be aided in their search for
	the blade by someone named Rashid.  They also meet Kofi.  Vardigan
	says that refugees ought to be allowed to leave the city unmolested.

256/1	The search for the blade, culminating in a great battle with its
	guardian in which Erak and Vardigan are almost killed.  Erak is
	maimed.  Vardigan has visions of a terrible court of an undead lord,
	where Mordanith and Morphus are also present.

260/1	Erak will live, but he will be crippled.

264/1	Mala has been fending off guards.

265/1	A great deal of activity beings, to celebrate the final victory and
	the return of the shiek.  The sheik gives Vardigan an obsidian
	medallion with a ruby tower.  They give him the title 'Tower of Blood'

266/1	A Dissenta Captain pays a visit, and tries to kill Storm.

274/1	Quatu tribesmen report seeing Morphus and Mordanith.  Erak gives
	Vardigan a holy symbol of Nahakar, a bronze circle and spear.

280/1	Simon Lefevre has been suffering from a fever.  He has expressed
	interest in travelling with Vardigan when he leaves.  Erak will
	stay behind.

313/1	After rest and preparation, the party takes leave.

315/1	The party is chased from an oasis by a giant snake.  They see signs
	of activity at the ancient citadel.

320/1	The party reaches the place where Vardigan killed the Red Sash
	Assassin.

321/1	Encounter a wyvern on return to the citadel of the Gatekeepers.

322/1	Vardigan commisions a shield from the Gatekeepers, and undertakes
	teaching Mala to fight.  Over the next thirty days, there will be a
	great deal of exploring of the tunnels and caverns near the Citadel,
	but this turns up nothing of significance.

357/1	A party of Dorian wizards calls at the citadel.  Vardigan disguises
	himself, but the leader, a Master Alterationist named Etarran, sees
	through the disguise.  He refers to the blade as a forging of
	darkness, and gives some advice on its care and use, and gives Vardigan
	a letter to introduce himself in Mardin and a gift in the form of a
	scroll.

	The wizards and the party remain for some time.  Over the course of
	this period the party encounters Bel again and learns something about
	dealing with the mountains from a geomancer.  There is a conclave of
	geomancers and a great magical battle.  Vardigan's shield is finished.

052/2	Mala faces the fact Vardigan will never be beholden to her.

069/2	Nadi comes with news of Qasiradam.  It's fallen into factional anarchy.
	The Dorian Alterationists are there, and Mordanith and Morphus have
	passeed through as well.  They have established something resembling
	peace in the region.

089/2	The citadel is visited by Keverian, the Lord of Light, who seems to
	be on the way to godhood.

100/2	The party departs from the citadel, and encounters a pyromancer who
	gives news of grave tidings in Mardin.  Jherek Firelord is on the
	march.

101/2	The party encounters a figure that rather resembles a desert walker.
	It warns of a great evil having been unleashed.  The supposition is
	that this is the demon from Qasiradam, released with the finding of
	the blade.

103/2	The party encounters the body inhabited by the demon, now dead.  A
	pack of wolves led by the demon attacks.  There is a great battle,
	great enough for Simon Lefevre to be moved to invoke Heimdall.  Mala
	is wounded, and eventually dies.

104/2	The party is forced back to the citadel.  They return with the aid of
	a geomancer they encounter at a henge they bypassed before.  Over the
	next ten days, the geomancers will seek out and do battle with the
	demon.  They are unable to kill it, but they can weaken it greatly.
	They provide Vardigan with magical items to aid in doing final battle
	with it.

114/2	Vardigan sets off to hunt the demon.

116/2	In the course of hunting the demon, Vardigan has more terrible dreams,
	battles with Dissenta, and talks with Falstaff.  He encounters a woman
	named Talla, an archer all in white hunting scnow creatures.

117/2	Vardigan does battle with the demon, and is nearly killed.

119/2	Talla and Simon come and help Vardigan, and bring him back to the
	citadel.  He'll be some time recovering.  Seven seperate attempts to
	steal Vardigan's scimitar will be made.

158/2	News of the world beyond reaches the citadel.  Mardin is half
	conquered and Jherek Firelord has acquired a new source of power,
	though Falstaff and the other Sun Lords seem to have stopped the
	advance.

	This news is brought by an illusionist named Oman.  He also
	indicates that artifcats have begin appearing:

	The Divining Blade		By a feudal baroness
	Heimdall's Shield		By the lord paladin
	The Defender			By a feudal lord
	The Eye of Arcan		By a grey elf in the north
	The Blade of Fire		By Nahakar
	The Cup Of The Elven King	By The King of the Lizard Men

	And the dead stir.

167/2	Vardigan's 19th birthday.

174/2

	The gods are warring.  Nahakar, Keverian, and Kay are involved,
	but the outcome is unknown.


175/2	The party departs the citadel once more.  In the next ten days,
	they cross a huge ice bridge and see the place where Mordanith and
	Morphus did their summoning.

185/2	The party reaches the lowlands.  The weather seems to have been
	corrupted.

187/2	The party meets a caravan of Hetasians bound for the Qeroshae,
	thinking it is paradise.

191/2	The party comes upon a change in the landscape, a huge plateau.
	They are apprehended by a cowled figure in red who tells them they
	are trespassing on Thunder Plateau.  He is an Evoker called Eraphani
	Estavar, and wears a silver and ruby ring.

192/2	The sunrise has a strange aura again.

195/2	Encounter a Dorian prince, attended by a paladin of Arioch.  The party
	gives tehm news of Qasiradam.

196/2	After a mana storm, the party sets out for Mardin.

198/2	The party encounters a hermit, and sees a caravan in the distance.

199/2	The party reaches the Temple of Hercules, to a joyful reunion with the
	priest and his attending dryads.

203/2	After weathering another mana storm, the party reaches Mardin.

204/2	The party does battle with 2 Red Sash Assassins, 2 city guards, and a
	mob.  Vardigan meets with Falstaff and tells him of his errand to the
	Alterationists.  They strike the bargain for magical tutelage for
	Vardigan's people.  More Red Sash Assassins are grist for Vardigan's
	mill, and eventually this teaches them he's a target they can't take.

205/2	The party sets out for the Frankish lands, Simon's home.

208/2	The party does battle with and slays three green-robed wizards.

210/2	As the land becomes more barren, the party passes a large gray tower.

212/2	The part encounters a broken-down wagon, which turns out to be yet
	yet another Dissenta trap.

217/2	The party encounters its first Frankish merchants.

218/2	The party reaches a walled town, the extermity of Frankish settlement.
	They spend the night in a barn, and meet a girl named Mala.

221/2	The party reaches an inn of sorts after a day in the rain.  A courier,
	a woman who looks like an elf (but isn't) enters.  While she and Simon
	get drunk, she gives news of coming across the badlands, where there
	has been a slave rebellion.  A man in his 40s arrives.  He is a herald
	for one of the Wizard-King's generals.

222/2	The party, the elf-woman, and the herald all leave together.  They
	reach a fortress.  Simon makes love with the courier.

223/2	The storm finally breaks.

224/2	The party departs for Simon's homeland.

227/2	The party reaches a castle held by Simon's relatives.  The heir to the
	places is there, drunk, whining over a woman.  Vardigan makes himself
	comfortable and fends off the serving girls.

228/2	Vardigan is brought to the Scriptorum at the Temple of Heimdall by a
	priest, a cousin of Simon's.  There, the blade is identified as having
	four aspects:

		A Body Guardian
		A Mind Guardian
		An Expression Of Will
		An Expression Of the Will of Arioch.

	Vardigan is granted a gift -- he may once call on Athena to aid his
	speech.

229/2	Vardigan meets the lord of the castle.  Simon's cousin Belvedere
	brings word of family trouble.  Another Baron has levelled a
	challenge.

230/2	Simon and Vardigan challenge this other lord and his champion.

231/2	Rodriguez, the other baron's champion, is taken prisoner.  Simon
	says he will stay and see things straightened out.

232/2	Vardigan sets out alone, leaving the Lefevre lands.

233/2	Vardigan meets a merchant, and exchanges news.

234/2	Vardigan changes some money at a town and presses on across the
	Frankish countryside.  He camps by a river, that appears to be
	haunted by memories of some ancient battle.

235/2	Vardigan reaches the road that leads to the capital.  He comes upon
	a priestess of Heimdall with a disabled oxcart, but she takes umbrage
	at his approach.  She is being victimized by a vampire -- her late
	husband.  Vardigan spirits her to safety in a temple.

236/2	Vardigan and the Saren named Agatha reach a town, and Vardigan is
	brought to see the Baron, who calls him a Prince.  He gives Vardigan a
	letter granting passage through the Frankish lands.

237/2	Vardigan is questioned by some knights bearing a lion-and-spear banner,
	but the letter satisfies them.  Vardigan passes a castle and reaches
	a town.

238/2	Vardigan enters a forest, where the locals are having trouble with
	werewolves.

239/2	Vardigan reaches a huge traffic jam outside the Frankish capital,
	where he encounters a Frankish Countess, Anastasia.  She is off to her
	aunt's estate, and he goes with her.  There is an attack by Dissenta,
	which Vardigan dispatches.

240/2	Vardigan keeps company with the Countess and her relations.  That
	night he goes to the Countess's bed.

241/2	Falstaff finally brings them to the head of the line of people waiting
	to see the king.   Vardigan is invited to a feast.  The Countess's
	cousin has an assignation with some sort of sorceror.  The Countess
	has come to see the king regarding her own lands.  Much discussion
	of varied topics.

244/2	The Countess has an argument with her uncle the Baron.

245/2	The Countess obtains the writs she wants from the king.  She and
	Vardigan encounter a death knight, but there is no violence.

246/2	Vardigan and the Countess sneak off -- there's reason to believe
	she's being watched and might be interfered with.

249/2	Vardigan gets the feeling the demon is near.

255/2	Some knights attempt to stop the Countess returning home.  The demon
	destroys a ghoul that's been pursuing.


256/2	They close on Anastasia's lands.  They meet her Master Huntsman, and
	eventually reach the 4-story stone manor house.  Everyone is surprised
	to see her.

	A messenger has news.  The Fairfields, Anastasia's western neighbors,
	were burned out a while ago.  No luck finding the culprits.  Some of
	them escaped.  This messenger comes from one Marchand.  It is decided
	Vardigan will go to see them with Edward, Anastasia's right-hand man.

	Vardigan has more bad dreams.

258/2	Marchand holds a keep, and he's training troops for something.
	Vardigan impresses the assembly with his own combat prowess.  A
	servant girl named Cheryse comes to talk to him about goings on there.
	She's afraid of her lord, and spends the night (chastely) with
	Vardigan.

259/2	Vardigan is invited to stay, but he decides to move on.  An oddly
	dressed priest bursts in, uninvited but unimpeded.  There are rumors
	of trouble with their overlord, a Duke.  The church turns out to be
	equally strange.  Vardigan encounters a half-Daushauan captain of
	mercenaries whose men are being employed to collect taxes.  Things stay
	peaceful.

260/2	The mercenaries ride off in the direction of the Duke's holding.

261/2	A new visitor is at the manor.  Antoine, some sort of long-haired
	sorceror, warning of gathering dark magic.  He is dispatched with a
	brief message to the capital.
	
	Others will be taking longer reports.  Vardigan has an argument with
	Anastasia's steward.
	
	Something definitely seems to be brewing and it would be bad if
	she were caught in a siege, but she is determined to stay.

266/2	Somewhere along the way, Vardigan has figured out he can command the
	demon that follows the blade.  He dispatches it to watch the Hetasian
	border.

269/2	An attempt is made on Anastasia's life, thwarted by Vardigan.  Oscar,
	her military chief, is not pleased by this penetration of the defenses.

270/2	Antoine returns.  He was successful.

"Macro Fun","Call FinalSpeed( base action speed, speed points)  

to determine what the default speed up for an action is.  This function assumes that
(a) you have enough speed points so that you always go negative on your initiative
and (b) that you have already subtracted off your initiative roll.  I compensate for the
latter at run time (see explanation below).

Example:

FinalSpeed( 12 count sword strike, 32 speed points ) -> 3 counts

Call ExtraSpeed( base action speed, speed points)

to determine the extra speed not used in the calculation above

ExtraSpeed( 12 count sword strike, 32 speed points ) -> 2 speed points

The way I handle initiative is as follows.  When I roll initiative I try to work it
off my extra speed and if I can't I buy it back at -10 per point.  This works
so much of the time that it is not a burden to recalculate on the fly for the
rest of the times.

Think think think!  Definitely different!  One is a fundamental alteration
of the matter - the elemental form and substance that comprises you.   The
spells I described are ""an illusion"".  Since you weren't wher ethe spell was
being cast and we are talking magic lore here and not experience I won't ask
you how you would know.  I don't think you have run into an illusionist of
any note- except for Loki.  And his ring basically does a VERY high level
Illusion.

If you have an illusion that you are a bird and you try to fly you will
fall- unless the illusion is high enough level.

>Are we in fact saying that High Illusion is basically a reality wall or is

At tsome point- way up there- ther eis no fundamnetal difference between
illusion and discipline magics.  It is one of the High Wizardries.

Two skills:  One is ""Illusion: Tactile Sense"".  The Other would be
""Illusion: Tactile Interactive"" or something like that, and the last would
be ""Illusion: Tactile Sensory Link"".

And this is why I tild you it was so hard- the ""Comprehend Languages"" spell
you guys use is based on millenium of work by diviners and mages to perfect
and make as compact and as efficient as possible that spell.  ANything you
guys whip up will not be even close - not even CLOSE to as effective as that
spell.   It is hard to transfer skill sets.  (Shut up you Fortu!)

I am confused- you know that Mordanith has this spell right?

No.  you owuld know if you were doing Illuisons- no one accidently stumbles
on illusion as a craft- you are more likely to stumble onto alteration!!!!!
You did a KIF SHapeChange.

I certainly wasn't happy about them either).
It was the new requirements for Spells and Rituals.

SPELL:                       L: 0.0, R: 0.0                  vs.      W:

Then way to resolve it if you don't have the minimum is: 
(NEEDED_RANK - ACTUAL_RANK)*10

vs.

({NEEDED_RANKS - ACTUAL_RANKS}SQUARED)*10

It is a reasonable thing to do, it is just going to hit me right in the

BIG minuses.  Not that I have a problem with it.  In fact, I'd like to go
on record as approving of the new rule.  I'd just like to acknowledge 
that 
it is a non-trivial change.

That reminds me...

Jim?  What is the casting language for Sun Bane?  

Lara?  What is the casting language for Spell Trigger?

Alex?  Where can I learn these languages?  How hard are they to learn?

My notes on sea-elves (Osser-Fey) indicate that the language is a dialect of Faer-han with a 
huge number of loan words from High-elven and several human tongues.

I was thinking of putting out some basic stuff on the Phoenix Rising sector

Actually Cephus taught you mostly to cast in Ancient Faer-Han for the most
part! :-) So probably all your casting stuff is castable by someone with
ranks in Ancient Faer-Han.  Modern Faer-Han would be an even worse stretch
for your spells than for than for Mordanith's spells!

I do have the layout and even a graphic file that I can send you if you
want it and can tell me your format of choice.  It may actually be more
useful to Myth than anyone else (without a little massaging, that is) since
I created it with MacDraw and I assume that you are still using a Mac.  I
will get the file when I go home tonight and try to get it sent out in
e-mail Saturday.  Here are the basics (assuming minimal variation as a
result of intermediate reality shifts) [I think that ranks in Legal-ese is
going to be a requirement for entities who are aware of and discuss
existing in a multiple reality framework!].  

Marden is the intersection of 12 line segments (twelve pieces of string
tied in the center).  The previous ""normal"" structure resulted in a high
concentration of power at the intersection of those lines.  I believe that
that was the center of the city.  After the repair of the damaged lines, a
view from above using a W:Abjuration filter would show an evenly
distributed web of nodes.  Each node has, I believe - and the graphic will
give the actual info - three line segments tied together.  

This distribution has the effect of making the entire structure more
resilient.  The destruction or Fraying of several nodes would not destroy
the overall integrity of the structure.  Also, this brought more power to
the edges of the structure (and thereby the city).  Although there was no
longer an extreme concentration at the location of the previous node, a
chart of the ambient mana distribution would still show the concentration
highest at the center of the web.  The difference now is that the
distribution of Mana is mathematically even.  Picture the distribution of
stars in the milky way galaxy.

Since we didn't actually have a map of the City that we could overlay the
grid on, Alex has been somewhat flexible in the discussions of where these
""mini-nodes"" are actually located.  I am assuming that the Council will
take by eminent domain (if they don't already have it) the real estate
located at the outermost set of mini-nodes in the web.  These would be the
key areas to build anchors for the City's magical defense system.

I am indeed still a Mac Myth.  I would be grateful for the file.

That agrees with my memory as well.  I would suspect 12 keynodes in the
outer ring, and 12 in the inner, but we might have gone for something 
different.

Either way, I suspect the outer nodes are Council-run (for city defenses)
as are the inner (for power).

Reality isn't nailed down?  <grin>

Well, I want my share of the 'mini-nodes' allocated.  It's time I started
marking my territory.

I wasn't able to find it this weekend.  I'll send it to you tomorrow.

Inner yes, but maybe not for the reasons that you might think.  Remember,
each Node (now) is the same as any other in terms of Power.  The key reason
for controlling any particular node is its physical location.  The ambient
mana level is higher in the center, but not a lot higher.  Where the
council used to have one node that all defenses were run out of, now they
actually have multiple nodes.  They are all of much less power, but the

"Sunbane for fun and profit","More trouble from the Mythmeister...

I've been thinking about those sunbane devices (okay: ""Summon Sunlight 
devices"") that we discussed (briefly) a run or two back.

While the 'pez dispenser' idea is an amusing one, I can't see Kilsorana 
wanting that many effigies of herself (at least, incomplete ones) roaming 
the streets and swearing at undead.  Besides, using her face could 
possibly make her a component in a device-destroying ritual, and 
Kilsorana can make enemies nicely on her own. (Besides, says E-man, it's 
just not dignified!)

(""Tis a silly place."")

I had been thinking of maybe a candle-driven lantern as a device.  Have 
ordinary mages make candles, wihch would provide the chief power for the 
rite.  Add a candle to a lantern, light it, and chant your little chant.  
Light blazes out, undead thingies turn to dust or stone, whatever makes 
the GM happy.

(Somehow, I am reminded of the frozen laser in 'Real Genius'.)

This lets us seperate the permanent, tricky, and salable stuff (the 
actual summoning of sunlight) from our still-tricky, but requiring mass 
production stuff.  Trade secrets are protected without any of us forced 
to work the assembly line at the widget factory.

Candles would need to be strong in beeswax (big Nature component), I'm 
thinking, with probably mixtures on herbs, spices, and oils.  Wicks could 
be woven with Weaver magic for whatever binding or (gasp) abjuration 
seems appropriate.  I am thinking of the lanterns as glass spheres held 
in a framework of wire, possibly mithril or platinum or silver.  Possibly 
gems in the framewoark to refract the light.

Whatever the construction (or nature) of the devoce, I think there are 
probably a few design constraints.

 1. Must be usuable by anyone (or anyone not undead).  Probably much 
better in the hands of a mage or priest.

 2. Should be able to operate, at least at a basic level, for twelve 
hours.  No sense leaving our monster-hunters in the dark any time before 
dawn.

 3. Should have at least a simple detect/react to undead; not necessarily 
seeking them out, but probably glowing brighter in their presence.

'Sokay.  I think I'm booked through Tuesday for anything serious.

Besides, the next run isn't until May 10th, and probably won't be
Marden-centric.

Well, I was thinking political power, rather than magical (they pretty 
much
have enough of that already, if you ask me).

Compare the number of nodes in the inner ring with the number of Archmages
in the Council.  I suspect that, within a decade, those numbers will 
match.
In Marden, political power follows magical power.

That is something that I hadn't thought of.  Now I want to see the layout

"Bardic Tales","Hello everyone.  On February 9, 1998, our beloved GM (OK, maybe that's a
bit much for some of you), sent out an e-mail message about having someone
in each group manage minor record keeping and dates.  He also asked for
someone to coordinate that information.  When no one else responded, I
volunteered to do the create the ""Timeline of Events"".

Although I knew that several runs had occurred between then and now, I
waited to see if I would get any information, either from Alex or anyone
else.  It has now been 3 months and I have not received anything (except
for the initial two e-mail responses from Jim Smith and Dave Wall).  

I realize that gaming in Bardic Tales probably is more important to me than
it is to anyone else (I can practically hear some of you saying ""get a
life"" :-)  ), but keeping even minor records is a benefit to everyone, not
just fanatics like me.

The first benefit is that Alex is running multiple groups and record
keeping helps him remember who did what when.

The second benefit is that none of us (including me) feel that gaming is
more important than working or family.   (OK, I would take the day off to
game, but I am the exception to the rule)  Therefore, we rarely think about
our characters so much that we walk into a run with a full understanding of
exactly what we were doing the last time we got together to run our character.

The third benefit is that we create a group ""story"" which adds depth beyond
what would exist  if Alex was just running our group and no other.

A perfect example of this is what is happening between the MKP group and
the Shapeshifters group.  There is a lot of cross group interaction
occurring.  It just so happens that my (Shapeshifters) character's
Significant Other is having a relationship with someone in MKP.  My
character doesn't know anything about this.  What is the time differential
between the two groups -- Alex may know now, but who will be able to say in
a few months (real time) when my character may find out during a run what
is going on?

Wouldn't it be of benefit to Morag or Maeve to find out what/when Mordanith
makes a deal with Madra to modify Nature in some way?  Wouldn't it be of
benefit to Morphus to find out when Miriel is playing with Kalarina and
Sigmund in Bachus' love spa?  Wouldn't Adrienne like to know when Kay has
led a Tolnian legion against the forces of Death in Bengali?  And wouldn't
Vardigan like to know when the balance of power in the town he is about to
attack has shifted because of.....

To bring this message to a close: anyone getting this message has e-mail.
All I ask is this: ask Alex what the date is when you run and type up a
brief (whatever YOU want) summary of your run.  Send this information to me
in an e-mail message and I will collate the data, send it to Alex, and he
will disperse it as appropriate.  I'll even collate the information that is
sent to me from all members of a group and send it back to them before
their next run date if I get it from multiple people in a group. 

Thanks for taking the time to read this message,
Chris

"Independant projects","Since Mordanith asked for help with his groups from Morphus, Morphus is
more than willing to assist in other ways as well.  One of Morphus's tasks
is to arrange for dangerous items to be pulled out of circulation.  While
working on this task his ""team"" has acquired many items which might be
useful to Falstaff and Mordanith's adventurers groups.  If you should
determine (during your in dependant role playing) that your group could use
some magical assistance, please let Morphus know and he will check his
""Inventory"" for the right item to fit the need.

One of two things will happen.  Either Morphus will give the item to
Mordanith to be placed so that the group can ""acquire"" it or, if Mordanith
or Falstaff agrees, Odin will give the item to a member of the party.  This
will, of course, serve multiple ends.

What you didn't hear at lunch was that I just attended a Grey Wanderer's
meeting.  It occurred right after we split up after the Kuresh expedition.
Chris to Jim: At the meeting, Morphus was tasked by Arioch to stop
appearing in public as Morphus/Kheldar.  From now on, he will only appear
in public (I hope we can make a few exceptions) as Wotan (Odin).  This
would be much easier for Morphus if he could work out with Mordanith an
arrangement for""appearances"".

"More Languages","I periodically send gaming questions to Alex (some of which he even replies to) and I thought this set of questions might be of general interest to the group.

Please view this in Courier New

[[[[[Questions About Sigmund's Current Set of Languages]]]]]

KORVENIR
In the mail Chris sent out it said at the end that Modern Korvenir was the script for the following languages:
    Marin
    Frankish
    Modern Pentaran
    Tarek
    Dwarvish

TARETHI
I assume that Tarethi and Tarethi script are closely related but different to Modern Korvenir.

(I will try not to be confused by the now extinct non-human race of Tyrethi who were responsible for the creation of the Lythar race and who spoke Necron.  I think I may have a ""too many realities make the brain mushy"" problem.)

Should I give up and assume that my Tyrethi lannguage and rune set are the same as Chris's Ancient Tarethi?

TAREK
Is there a modern Tarek and an Ancient Tarek?
I have skill in Tarek script, is this an error?
What is Tarek related to?

DORIAN
I also have skill in Dorian script.  I assume that this is one of those loosely descended from Elvish type languages.
Does this script apply to other languages?
I have both Ancient Dorian and Dorian.  Do they use the same script?

Also, I have a language which in the early days we called Predecessor Dorian.  It was the language which was spoken by the people in the Dorian area before the people who spoke Ancient Dorian moved there.  Who were these people?  Where they human?  I have a feeling that as long as I continue to call this language Predecessor Dorian I will never find anyone else who uses it.

GOLDEN EMPIRE
Also I have a little confusion (maybe) about my Golden Empire family of languages.
I speak Golden Empire (Golden One?- does this have another name?).
I speak Na-Khor.
I assume these are different.
I read/write Goldem Empire.
I assume this is different than Neth-a-ni-yu and Symbian (as per our java analogy).
Did the Na-Khor use a different culture-script (as opposed to magic script).
BTW:  My memory is that the Na-Khor were a created race which was the servant class of the Golden Ones.  Is this true?  If so were there other such races?
I assume that all of these are different than Ancient Rhleanian.

ELVISH
Along the same vein I speak Faer-han and Quentar and I have skill in written Tolnydren.
I had always assumed that when elves wrote each other letters they wrote on Tolnedryn.  Is this not true?
Is there a skill written Faer-Han which I do not have?

NO SCRIPT
I assume that the following languages have no written form
Kosari
Philosian
Cat
Bird
Draconic (other than Draconic Runes)

OTHER LANGUAGES
Here are the rest of the languages that I speak.  Just in case they have obvious written forms:
Kaern
Dao Shoan (Ancient and Modern)
Tolnian
Hittatian
Bengali
Ancient Estarran (used only as a casting language)
Ancient Rhelanian (used only as a casting language)
Necron
Ancient Multath (used only as a casting language)
Lythar
Keristeen
Kua-Tou (used only as a casting language)

Date: Monday, May 11, 1998 4:37 PM
Subject: Languages


Here is my list of wizardries and the language and rune I wish to cast each in.  At the moment I do not have any sub-schools.  I also do not have languages and rune sets selected for the disciplines.  Do these need them?
 
Language:    Ancient Dorian      RuneSet:    Symbian
    Aeromancy
    Geomancy
    Hydromancy
    Pyromancy
The only one not listed here was pyromancy.  Was there a reason that Ancient Dorian is a bad choice for pyromancy?  If not I would assume based on the huge number of mages in marden that it would be possible to learn it in this way.  Why did Symbian get adopted so widely as a magical rune set?  I assume it was developed by/for the Na-Khor yet other schools seem to use it.  Is this because so much of the world was occupied by the Golden Empire?
 
Language:    Ancient Estarran    RuneSet:    Arkenian
    Ecomancy
    Healing
I don't have much rank in either these wizardries or the languages but I assume they are a good match since they were listed.  What is the origin of these?  Was/Is Estarran a human culture?
 
Language:    Na-Khor             RuneSet:    Symbian
    Enchantment
    Evocation
I assume these are good choices.  I also like them becuase I have a feeling (albeit small) for the culture behind the language and runes.  In both cases this combo was only listed for sub-schools.  I assume it can apply to the wizardries in general.
 
Language:    Faer-Han            RuneSet:    Tolnedryn
    Luminomancy
    Abjuration
    Divination
Faer-Han was not listed for any of these schools but they all seem like very typically elvish schools.  I would only want to use these languages if it would not be out of character for Nuryev to use them indpendant Sigmund working with Mordenaith a lot.  I also would not want to use them if they suck for the purpose.  What do you think?

Language:    Necron              RuneSet:    Nedron
    Necromancy
    Shadow Weaving
I thought that you had said at one point that Necron was the ideal casting language for death magics.  I extrapolated that it would be good for dark as well and it seemed like a good choice since I am fluent in it.  Is this approporiate?
 
Language:    Kua-Tou             RuneSet:    Kisstan
    Alteration
    Conjuration
    Warding**
    Net**
I assume these are OK as well.  Warding is actually the sub-school of abjuration which I am specifically using for Ward Ops and related spells.  Net is the general skill which I am trying to turn into a Wizardy.  Both of these are nebulous at the moment nd we should talk about them.  I have asked several times what runeset the ward interface is programmed in and you have dodged the question.  Is Kua-Tou a good choice?
 
Language:    Ancient Rhelanian   RuneSet:    Neth-a-ni-yu
    Illusion
What is Ancient Rhellanian?  Is it the same as Golden Empire?  I probably would prefer to cast Illusions in Golden Empire if that is more powerful (and since I know it better).  Would that be a better choice?  Perhaps I could cast it in Na-Khor?
 
Language:    Draconic            RuneSet:    Draconic Runes
    Will Working
This language set was also not listed but I assume it is the ideal pair for a will working wizardry.  Is that true?  I assume that Hieroglyphs are different than Draconic runes.  Is that correct?
 
Tell me what you think about these selections.  At some point I would like to learn more about the Kua-Toa as well as what culture Slaad came from.

Well, the short answer is: because that is what Alex told me to send to you.

I am going to speak to the message that Jim J-M sent, but it applies to
every Player in the Bardic World, not just Jim.  I'm only sending it to you
three, plus Alex, because we are together enough that it matters how we
relate to each other.  

In general, I tend to be far less ""aggressively"" creative than others in
the group (much to Alex's disappointment).  I come up with ideas (and I
know that I can be quite verbose!), but generally only after I've grilled
Alex and he admits that he hasn't written anything up on the subject.  The
only exception to this is where I've made suggestions to make the Norse
elements in his world more closely parallel Norse Literature.  And
generally, I submit my ideas directly to Alex for his approval before
mentioning them to anyone else.  
The memo that I just sent out as a response to Pookie's ""More Languages""
post was 2 parts grammar and spelling, 1 part previously-disclosed
Alex-sourced info, and 2 parts Ad-lib.  That 2 parts Ad-lib caused me
anxiety, after the alcohol wore off, about the responses I might get.
(Jane being gone for the week, I had three pints at the local pub while
eating dinner and reading e-mail)  The next morning I decided to send it
anyway because Alex has been asking me to be more up-front creative.

For the most part, if you get an e-mail from me stating that ""this is the
way it is"", it is because I got a bunch of information from Alex and passed
it on to you at his request.  If you don't like it, discuss it with him.
He'll either change it or he won't.  As the person who has volunteered to
be his secretary, if I get the data wrong he'll correct me or ""fire"" me.
Yes, asking him questions and writing it all down gets ME information, but
what it is more important to all of us (him included), is that the goal is
to make each of our runs as effective as possible.  Trying to remember what
happened in the past (what was his name? When did that happen?  What did we
do in the last run that was two months ago real time?) uses up time that we
could be spending role-playing.

Alex, Pookie and I had a conversation Thursday in which we discussed our
different points of view.  Chris's view (not Morphus's view) is, in
summary, this:  The world we play in has multiple realities.  None is any
more real than any other.  None was ""first"".  All of our characters
perceive the world differently, some more differently than others.  Because
there is a lot of information and it is often non-linear, I need to write
it down to remember it.  Alex has found this to be useful.  We try to write
down information from his head and from scattered notes whenever we can.
He has asked me to send what I have to some of you sometimes.  Most of the
time, I only have Alex as a source.  From now on, when data from multiple
sources conflicts, Alex will determine if one of them is Wrong (you
misunderstood) or if that is the information that your character operates
with.  In the first case he may correct you or change his information to
match yours.  In the second case, he will respond with who ""believes"" that
information.  I will note down in any document that I write whether everyone
believes the info or just Character X.


Fair enough?  Alex, Pookie - did I state that correctly?

"Re: Bardic Tales World Gaming","I whole heartedly appluad your attempt to get as much as possible in writing
as well.  Also, after having had our discussion on Friday, I am appreciative
of your 2 parts spelling and grammar and will attempt to adopt the universal
tags for things (since it makes it easier to compare our individual
interpretations).  You will have to be patient with me since I have a long
history of using my own phonetic alphabet to overcome.  Also we should
address whether spelling can ever have political meaning (e.g. is the
importance of Tolnedron vs. Tolnydron universally recognized - I am willing
to buy it but it is a case where spelling may be more than just a
convenience of communication).

As far as the rest of what you said:  I am going to start playing with a web
enabled DB layout sometime today and we will see if anything comes of it.  I
am all for a central repository of information as long as EVERY piece of
information is attributed with the name of a player who believes it to be
true.  I understand Alex's argument that sometimes it is expediant to just
FIAT that everyone believes that on the prime leaves are green, and from a
playability stabdpoint I can deal with this.  I would just like to see us
always err on the side of no absolute truth vs. absolute truth.  I propose
we establish the following ground rules for proper information treatment:

1.    Every piece of information is automatically attributed with the
perspective of the person who entered it.

2.    Only Alex is allowed to use the perspective all (i.e. everyone
believes this universally).

I would even suggest that this should only be set by Alex himself.  This
will clearly decrease the amount that is attributed to universal truth but I
think this is the side to err on.  Also, just becuase a bit on info about
the Tolnian script is attributed to Chris's perspective does not mean that
Sigmund will not believe it.  I will still assume it to be true unless it
conflicts with my world view.

3.    No one is allowed to edit data which is in anyone else's perspective
(except Alex).

E.g. if Chris enters ""FACT001277 Chris believes...that Madra created the
wizardry school of Geomancy 15000 years ago"" and Sigmund knows that it was
actually 15347 years I should NOT edit Chris's data without his explicit
permission.  I should either run it by Chris or enter a follow on fact of my
own which states ""Pookie believes...FACT001277 except that it happened 15347
years ago"".  Ok perhaps we need to work on the presentation there.  In any
case, I think you get the point.

4.    When a piece of information becomes no longer true becuase it was a
bad statement on Alex's part (the rare retraction) it will be deleted.

5.    When a peice of information becomes no longer true because it was true
and then reality was altered and in the new dominant consensus it is no
longer true the information will be marked as Invalidated.  A reason will be
given as to what invalidated it (e.g. the great discipline casting by the
forces of Order on blah blah date) and that fact will be filtered from any
active query capability we come up with if we manage to go electronic.

The following has been a Jim E-W opinion.

"Re: Request for Assistance","Actually I think I might speak Ancient Faer-Han, but that's OK, us Fortu are
thick skinned.

Also, I assume that the below exchange is still Jim to Jim.

Yes, I do think the LWoN is one of the linch pins of reality at the moment
and frankly that is why I am even more interested in doing this.  I don't
like him sitting on anything fundamental to my world.  If you might think
that this is a little quick in coming, in some ways I have been planning
this since the moment he integrated into this reality again.  As far as
danger to the consensus, I think the best time to take him out is when the
ward is disconnected from the symbol so that the machine is unpowered.  That
is my sense of urgency, since my original plan has me showing up in 4-6
weeks after the time of the ritual with the fixed symbol of consensus ready
to plug back into the machine.  I want to make sure that he is NOT in the
driver seat when I plug things back in.

Reminder - this is Jim to Jim - not Sigmund to Mordenaith - I don't want to
compromise security on these issues.

As far as the fact that he is a disgustingly gross high level discipline
weilding mage who makes any one of us look like a pimply teenager with a
switch blade vs. a green beret.... Well, thats why I am recruiting a group.
I think as long as we have a plan slightly more complex than get'im we stand
a good chance.  Besides, we are pretty disgusting our selves.  It is not
really that outrageous I think.

Actually, that is not a bad idea ...  Let's include phonetic entries along
with the ""correct"" spelling.

Spelling variance over time and culture is something that occurs with
spoken and written language.  Alex does have that within the languages, but
we haven't talked about having different cultures call the languages
different things.  If we do that, though, could we have a single ""database""
tag to identify five different ""languages"" as being the same?  The reason
is that 4 characters who speak Blat, Soomic, Thrunc and Grop would easily
discover that they were the same language.  We players would not.  And I'm
more concerned with Chris than Morphus.

>1.    Every piece of information is automatically attributed with the

Sounds good.  We should also add other names if another character learns
the information.

These two statements seem to be identical??

Sounds fine.  Lets agree that we don't delete or change records without a
thorough search for related records.  And the issue about ""no one editing"":
I agree about discussing it between ALEX, POOKIE and CHRIS before making a
change, but we're clear that anyone who volunteers to do the work can make
the actual changes, right?

See response to 3 above.

NOPE!  I'll agree with something that notes the data as ""not concurring
with the current reality consensus"", but it can't be removed from query.
For example: (Alex to Chris) the Tarethi firmly believed (even before I
cast my ritual) that Odin existed and that he was the head of the Pantheon
that included Heimdel.  Most of the rest of the world knew nothing about Odin.

"Random Musings on Reality","What follows is a post sent me by Pookie it accurately summarizes three
possible models of looking at my universe (and for that matter ours).

I thought it was cool and well-written and so, with Pook's permission , I
share it with you now.  Brace yourselves- it gets a little heavy and deeply

>>Subject: Random Musings on Reality

I am writing down some random views I have about reality shifting and how it
relates to the skills I have.  This is in order to clarify the thoughts I
have and as a way to figure out where I can go from here.

JIM'S RECOLLECTION OF THE WORLD

So far we have talked about reality alteration using a number of models:

Simplest Model  - Objective Reality

At one level we talk about reality as if it's properties were stored
somewhere.  In this view each property of reality has one and only one
value.  For example, things always fall down.  This value may be conditional
with reference to a locale, such as things always fall down except in the
Abyss, but it is always delegated by a clear set of rules.  I like to view
this as the Newtonian model of reality.

Another Model - Consensus Reality

In this model of reality all of the properties of reality exist only in the
conversation between people (actually Context Generating Beings [CGBs]).
Some conversations are more fundamental than others, like things fall down,
and these conversations are so ingrained into our world view that they take
on a life of their own.  In cases like these we can tend to objectify the
conversations and deal with them as entities in and of themselves.  Thus it
can make grammatic sense to talk about altering The Consensus or The
Consensus exerting a restorative force.

In the advanced stages of this model we adopt the view of aggregate reality
perception in which each individual CGB exists in its own self-generated
reality which may differ in microscopic ways from anyone else's.  In this
model, concepts such as planes can be seen as a local clumping in which the
deviation of any one entity from the norm is small compared to it's
""distance"" from any other clump.  We could say that the member's of a plane
share a common perception becuase their world views are so similar.  We
could also say that the great mass of consensus around the common concepts
of the plane form a restorative force. The result of this force is that,
when an individual strongly changes their view around one of these
fundamental concepts, either their view is restored back to the group
consensus or the group consensus is drawn to the new view.  This all depends
on the force of the CGB asserting the new view and the mass of consensus
against which this CGB is acting.  In some sense it also depends on the
reasonableness of the new viewpoint in relation to other beliefs in the
consensus (it is not odd for a human to float in mid-air if they are an
evoker).

Another Model - Patterned Reality

An alternate model for viewing reality which exists at the same level is
that of patterned reality.  In this model every CGB  generates a reality
which surrounds them, just as above, and this reality differs in microscopic
ways from the reality of any other entity.  The difference in the models is
in the view of the reality characteristics.  In the patterned reality, each
set of common precepts (or conversations) which is shared by a set is viewed
as a class which all of the objects of the set inherit from.  In this way
being a creature of the prime is a class which humans derive from and human
is a class which Tolnians derive from, etc.  Thus we view the the set of all
CGB's less as a set of discrete objects and more as a tree of shared
properties.

In fact, in this model, one would be faced with the philosophical question,
""If two entities share completely the same inherritance tree of classes then
are they in fact one entity?""  In some ways, however, beyond a few
metaphysical questions like the prior, the difference between this and the
above is semantic.  In other senses, it is very much akin to the
philosophical-physical paradox of wave-particle duality.

The way in which the difference between these two models is less than
semantic is in the subjective perception of how easy it is to effect change.
In the consensus model, changing one's reality is merely a matter of
changing one's belief.  There is the danger expressed that if you change in
too radical a manner you will be orphaned from the consensus with which you
were associated and cast adrift.  There is also the restorative force which
acts to prevent casual drift from severing ties with the consensus group of
attachment.  Both of these appear, however, to be surmountable by a strong
will.  In the patterned reality model it appears more that the
characteristics which define you are universal patterns which are harder for
you to control.

If, for example, you are a human and you wish to change one of the
characteristics which you posses which is inherently human (say having two
arms) in the patterned model it appears that you would need to either change
this characteristic for all humans (daunting) or reparent yourself to some
class other than human.  In the consensus model it would appear that all you
would have to do is change this characteristic in yourself and then convince
the consensus that it was normal.  The conversation human seems much more
fluid in this model.

In some sense, we can view the difference as moot.  The pattern-viewed
person is really reparenting to a new class which they are creating as a
subclass of human but then explaining to the consensus why these new
subclass-humans are not unusual.  The consensus-viewed person, in convincing
the consensus-group that this is normal is redefining the concept of
humanness.  Despite the fact that they are compatible, however, the flavor
of each seems to indicate that consensus-viewed manipulation is easier but
more dangerous and pattern-viewed manipulation is harder but more
far-reaching.

Anyway, that's the impression I get.

"THE BALANCE, Story 1 of 4","Many have asked, few know.  When I am done fewer will know.  Just
kidding!:-)

A lot of people have asked about the ""Balance"".  I have written four
vignettes which point to different aspects of the balance.  Some of you
don't know what the heck the balance is, and frankly, you could care less.
Please feel free to delete now.:-) However since I wasn't sure who cared and
who didn't I sent it  to everyone who might be effected.

I am going to give four interpretations of the Balance.  They are all true
and none of them are the Truth.
This post includes the first of the four....

fire-orange and her crystal eyes glittering against smooth pale skin.
""Ahhhhhhh.. ,"" she sighed, ""You want to know about the balance?""

""Well... know this children.  The world cannot abide any force unchecked.
Any force that arises, that becomes active- be it a magical node, an
enchanted castle, or an overly ambitious king's lust for worldly power- is
countered by a force that is its equivalent.  Ahhhhh the Mother Earth cannot
stand an imbalance- she responds naturally to any thing that breaks the
cycle of time and nature.  ""

She shrugged and looked up at the stars twinkling over head as the cold wind
whistled through the camp.  ""It is said that when the balance of the world
is broken, the world will topple back into the watery void from whence it
came and we will all die screaming as the waters of nothing close on us.
That the balance is what gives our  lives meaning.  ""

She looked down at the large, frightened eyes staring at him from around the
camp fire.  One of the children had gotten so frightened that he reverted to
bear form- and the bear cub was now hiding behind his big brother.  She
laughed.

""Come out silly!  There is nothing to be afraid of!  ""

""But.. but.. what if we do something to upset the balance... like last week
when I knocked Mama's sword off the wall!"" Jeremy blurted, his bright eyes
darting back and forth.

For a moment her eyes looked sad and far away, and then she smiled- a quiet,
happy smile which peeled her years away. ""You are too small child, to be of
notice to the balance.  Only the big players of the world, the ambitious
players,  need to concern themselves with it.""

""Like Great-Aunt Dora?"" little Kathleen spouted out.  ""No silly!"" Jeremy
interjected, ""Aunt Dora is little!""

She laughed. ""Yes, Katie, just like Great-Aunt Dora.""

""What about you?""  Jeremy asked, ""Are you a big player?""

She paused, and then ruffled his hair. ""No, Jeremy, I'm not.""

But the howling of wolves and the song of the night wind gave the lie to her
words.....

*** *** ***

The First Elder paused and a ripple shimmered across the assembly.

Mazientir of the Sword frowned as more and more of the fifth generation
stepped from the pattern into the meeting hall in Yris.  Yris's Conversation
Holders filled the balconies almost to the point of having to grow them
deeper into the Tree.  He hated being responsible for the Safe Speaking in
this cluttered, reality-bound place on the Prime Agreement.

His will expanded out to include the whole hall and as the last of the fifth
generation that were expected stepped into the hall he sealed the Wards
protecting the room.  He sensed no Malice, nor Danger in the minds around
him.  He searched for and could not find any servants of the Wanderer.  Of
course, if the Wanderer chose to be here, then he was here somewhere.

He re-directed his primary view to the branch that the First Elder were
standing on.  He was joined by several other Elders- and the young Warden -
from the Thalionsaer family- that was sent by the Second Power to this
Agreement to monitor and integrate and express the will of the Second Power.
He looked at him with undisguised curiosity.   He was accelerated in
experience far beyond his temporal range.  He de-focused and studied the
intentions in the room and the ward as the First Elder began speaking again.

""The Balance.""  A stir of thoughts and concerns filled the room.  ""It is...
in question. ""

An audible gasp ran through the room.  Every being in the room stood still
and directed their aura up at the First Elder.  ""As you all know the beings
of the Second Power integrated the Balance as a primary thread in the
conversation of the Prime Agreement.  This was aligned on by all the
Secondaries in all the Prime Agreement Verticals that are translatable from
this Agreement.""

A young Quentar- one of the sixth generation- sent an interrogative pulse to
the First Elder, he acknowledged it with a flick of thought.  ""Elders- then
how can it be in question?  There has been no unraveling, and no force has
been generated contra to that thread!  What you are saying is impossible
unless the Victim is about to be Released- and of that there are few signs.
""

Waves of disapproval rose at the young Quentar's rude, and hasty question.
The First Elder frowned, but the young Warden floating by the First merely
smiled and nodded at the young Quentar.

""Nonetheless.  The Keeper of the Voice of the Secondaries reports that more
and more it is forced to intervene, and soon it will reach its capacity to
do so.  It has been fundamental to this agreement since before time but it
has only become vocalized in the latest iterative transformation at the
stilling of the Second Power 'Kratchelov'""

He paused and a visual representation of the Pattern of the All-World
appeared.  ""However, with the exiling of the Shared Voice, the disruption of
Kratchelov's servants, and the resurfacing and unbinding of many of the
Bound Voices it is weak and its conversation threatens to submerge.  We must
therefore take hasty, pre-emptive action to intervene.  Over the several
years more and more of you will be trained to integrate with the Prime
Agreement to add your voices to the Voice.  ""

Mazientir smiled grimly as he felt intention and purpose rise from the
gathered Faer-Han.  Then he felt a tickle in the back of his mind, the feel
of something slithering against the ward.  He directed his mind towards it
just a second before he felt the Danger in doing that, and then the Fire
Raver consumed him.

"THE BALANCE, 3 of 4","""Checkmate in twelve moves""

The growl came from deep within the Dragon's throat. It's eyes widened and
it's second and third lids slid back as it studied the adamantine and
mithryl figures on the board between them.

The mage laughed and then sprang to her feet, doing a little jig as she spun
around the gigantic board.

The Dragon spoke- in Language, of course- ""Very well, Acrivain.  You have
defeated me.  What is your question? ""

She swept her long hair back and drew in her breath.  Before she could speak
a voice- soft, fluid, teasing- spoke in her ear.  ""Be careful mistress- ask
for something real.  Trusssst me in thisss.  The Dragon's knowledge is
worsssse than noooo knowledge at aaall!""

Acrivain slapped her hand on the curved black sword at her side and hissed,
""Quiet Demon!""  At her touch of the sword the fully grown Troll- settled
behind her- stirred.   The Dragon's eyes narrowed and then re-widened and
stared at Acrivain.

""WELL?""  Acrivain leaned back against the almost palpable DragonFear that
swept around her.

""Tell me of the Balance! What is it?  What is it's history! ""

Laughter rang in the space of the cavern.  ""Are you sure, little meat
puppet?  It will be dangerous for your little linear life for you to know
that answer- and you will fail at what you seek in the gaining of what you
ask. ""

""Tell me, damn you!  You gave your Word.""

""So I did- and I am my Word.  Sit down....""  His claw motioned to the
beautiful divan that appeared behind her.   She felt the Troll's senses
sweep over the couch, taste it, decide it wasn't a threat to her, and
recede.  She sat down.   He thought for a moment framing the Truth in her
context, capabilities, and experience.

""The Balance,"" he began, ""can be understood as a Pact between the most
powerful beings in the universe.  It was forged merely centuries ago in your
linear time stream but has always shaped YOUR epoch's history.""

""Yes, yes..."" she interrupted, ""I know all about Discipline 3 Reality
Transforms- go on!""

He paused, waiting just long enough to make her uncomfortable, and then
continued.

""The Balance is a Pact between the greater beings that survived the Chaos
War.    Some of those beings you cannot comprehend but they include: the
Second Power, the Protector, the Judge, the Human-Father, the Seeker, my
father, and my aunt-against her will I might add.

""The pact monitors and binds all being of a certain, how would you say it as
a human being, hmmm...
all beings of a certain soul weight.  No- that is not a effective way of
saying that.  It monitors and binds all beings of a certain effectivity in
your World.  This effectivity is measured by soul strength and mass, and the
being's capability to express that strength and mass in your world.

""As soon as a being becomes strong enough, or massive enough, or effective
enough it becomes indoctrinated into the Pact.  This is done with or without
the being's knowledge and consent.  The being authorized by the Pact holders
to instance the Pact makes those decisions.  Currently, that being is my
father, who was one of the major architects of the Pact.

Acrivain stamped her foot. ""I want to know the way it works... how will it
impact me when my time comes!  I want to know so I can avoid its hold on me.
""

""Yes,"" the Dragon rumbled, ""You know then that once you are in the Pact you
are bound to it for it's existence.""  He laughed.

""What's so funny?""

""The irony, little spark plug.""

""Stop calling me things like that!!!"" She gripped the handle of the black
sword and the Troll stood suddenly, rising to its full height and orienting
itself towards the Dragon, ""Don't make me press my case.....""

The Dragon again was silent and still.  ""Very well.  If I may....  once
bound you are ever bound, and who you are is part of the conversation.  What
you know the conversation knows.  Of course those that spoke the pact were
wise enough to not let that information be accessible to anyone- that
knowledge merely fuels the intention of the pact.

""Its design is to keep any power from upsetting the Consensus Reality that
makes up your World and your conception of Time.  The pact has re-shaped and
given history to Epochs stretching back before your ancestors climbed the
trees to avoid their Lethar predators.  This is how it does that:  Any
action taken by a member of the Pact against another member of the Pact will
result in an equivalent counter-action- in the form of information or
'coincidence'- to happen or be made available to the opposing forces of the
initiator of the actions.  The more powerful the member of the Pact the
lower the threshold of actions that will trigger the Pact's measures.
Humans and elves brought into the Pact can do almost anything and not have
the Pact Act.  The Greater Gods and the Titans must move carefully in every
action they take.  ""

""What are the rules?"" she asked hurriedly, ""What sets this threshold?""

""The threshold is decided by the Over-conscious Consensus of the Pact
Holders.  The rules also are set that way.  ""

""What?  There are no set rules?""

The Dragon voice rumbled, ""The rules are whatever the Over-Conscious
Consensus decides are the rules.""

""Damn.  That is a lot harder to work with and get around!""

The Dragons laugh shook the cavern.  ""Too late, little meat puppet!  This
knowledge gives you just a little too much power! WELCOME TO THE BALANCE!""

The Dragon's roar rattled Acrivain's sword as she raised her fist at the
heavens and gnashed her teeth...

"THE BALANCE. part 4 of 4","
They moved through the Void.  They watched, though any meaningful comparison
between what they did and human sense impressions would be ridiculous.  For
our story we will say they watched and we will speak of their bodies.

They looked out and watched some more.  They ""saw"" the Bright One and the
Mother embraced and twined against each other, deeply penetrating each other
in a lover's grip.  She Who Waits covered them like a blanket as if to hide
their indiscretions from the Void.

The Bright One moved inside the Mother and she sighed and shifted against
him.  He gripped her closer and they moved together.  The Watchers eye kept
going to the bed in which the Mother and the Bright One embraced- for they
had made it.  Woven of different thoughts, contrasting, scintillating and
beautiful they watched as it danced and shimmered against the skin of the
two lovers.  They watched as the light and dark, threads unwinding and
reforming, chased themselves across the bed and admired their handiwork.  A
thing of beauty.  They both nodded, satisfied.  It would last until the
lovers were done.  No element too strong, no unbinding too fast- a true work
of artistry.  An objet d'art in perfect balance.

They watched for something like a time, and then, satisfied, they left
again.

Okay.  It isn't designed as a container, it isn't built to hold anything.
You would have to ""turn"" Rhysmaeon into something that could live in a
stick.  It is a stick not a universe- and it is a universe that is a stick.
Does that make sense?

Given that you could shove him in there somehow- he would get out as soon as
he figured out the nature of his prison- which would take from 3 counts
minimum(he would need to cast three Disciplines to get out minimum and let's
just say he gets lucky and does one count disciplines.  Very unlikely but
possible with good dice luck)  to seconds to 10 seconds tops.

       I think it would be very difficult but not impossible....    The
thing that is important is for me to be familiar with his being.  If there
is anyone close to that or if I can study something/someone then the

it a try :>

       If we could take him by surprise that would be even better.  Would
it be at all possible to go back in time and have me ""research"" him in a

"Dwarves","Morphus would like to ask Mordanith what he knows about the ""creation"" of
the Dwarves.  How were they created, why were they created, who created
them and when were they created compared to the other races.

Obviously, this all depends on whether your character has this information

"RE: Images","Hmmm..

Fire Mountain:

A gigantic volcano surrounded by black glowing clouds at it's summit. It is
sitting in a gigantic impact crater.  That is shaped like a pie dish....
mostly flat and then steep cliffs on all sides.  Fire Mountain itself is a
broad, squat shape- VERY VERY high, but extraordinarily broad- sitting in
the middle of it.  Cities are scattered up and down the slope of the
mountain...

Occasionally dark shadowed dragons can be seen flying around the volcano....
Also: its dark.  Unfiltered sunlight never hits the crater.  At BEST- very
rare- it could be a foggy daylight!

The Bridge:

Surrounds the world, but it is so big that when you are on it it looks like
a flat plane with knee high mist(just under eye-level for sigmund).  There
are ""stripes"" or ""lanes"" or light pouring underneath the mist to cause the
colors of the rainbow.  The ""sky"" is rolling dark blue clouds- like storm
clouds against a dark blue background.  If you stare at them too long you
see the shapes of things to come, or might come, or those things that have
come, or might have come....  Occasionally shapes made of blue mist will
bubble out of the mist and then disappear into it again.
It is surreal and beautiful.... you can hear high-pitched angelic singing
right at the edge of your hearing all the time... :-)
Sometimes it is a featureless plane- but if you approach the throne of power
what you will see is a Temple sitting in the middle of the bridge that is
Grecian and is modeled after the Parthenon in Athens. There are two gigantic
Feudal looking Knights in shining, golden Plate Armor holding burning spears
at each side.

Running out of time!  Have to go....

"Shifters: Heads up on plans for the Next Run - Dwarves","For Morphus to make decisions about what he is going to do it is really
necessary to either have or work on getting information on the Dwarves (all
the stuff that I have asked some of you).  I realize that he may not be
able to get that information, but at the moment he is attempting to do so.

It would be useful (though not necessary) if he had or could work on
getting similar information on the Tarethi (Vikings).

Since I haven't had much luck gathering this information outside of play, I
plan on having Morphus do some research/divination during the first part of
our run on the 28th.  

I suggest that we also take some time to briefly discuss our separate
Lich/Balance/Chaos War related projects and create a strategic plan of
action (and thus activities for runs) going forward.  I am quite willing to
get together before the 28th if people want to reserve the 28th for mostly
running.

As for the run itself, it appears as if the Monks of the Flaming Heart
monastery have come up with a lead on one of the pieces of the Lich's
heart.  I hope to know more by the 28th.

Neither E-man nor I have no special information on Dwarves.

And, for that matter, both of us are concerned with your plans for such 
info.

We know even less about these (either revision), having at least -met-
a Dwarf or two (or four...)

Okay.  I doubt that those of us not running the world will have much to 
say 
about that.  As far as I know, we all have the right to do research and 
divination.

I would like to use the 28th for mostly running.

E-man and I have no Lich/Balance/Chaos War related projects, but will 
consider
assisting on a case-by-case basis.

Good for them. E-man is not overeager to blindly follow proffered leads,
having learned caution, suspicion, and mistrust.

(Gee, he's really developing his dislikable side, isn't he?  I don't 
think he'll be nearly the fan favorite in this series that he was in the 
last.  Maybe if he got adamantium claws?)

"Tactical Situation","
You know, it just occured to me that we are going into a highly dangerous tactical situation this Sunday and it might be very beneficial to have a plan.
 
Here is the situation as I remember it.  We are located in a wide gully.  The gully is more than a mile wide but the main corridor (flat section) is only about 900 yds wide, to the side of which are rising slopes.  The sides of the gully are probably cliffs but I suspect that tactically they will be out of the picture.
 
We are situated at a spot in the gully where two berms (small rises in the terrain) cross the gully floor.  The berms are aproximately 300 yds apart and are tall enough to block LOS of normal humans (and probably even the big guy).
 
There is a large army aproaching the area from (lets call it for the sake of argument) the west.  This army consists of a large number of undead, mostly ghouls with a few ghasts (or was it mostly zombies with a few ghouls).  There are also a small number of Necromancers and a large proto-dragon in the lead.  The proto-dragon seems to have the reality mass profile of a small dragon but appears much more physical rather than magical.  We have no information about it's intelligence.  The head of the army is 1 mile away.  1/4 mile away is a line of lethar scouts preceding the main troops.  The following troop composition was obtained by Kor'Keth on a scouting mission.
 
For assets on our side we have: Sigmund, Kor'Keth, D'Jan, Mordenaith, Morphus, E-Man, Khalid, Arack, Mr. Justicar(whats his name?), Kilsorana (the talking horse), Muriel and the Storm Warden.  As I recall neither Pentos or Peter came and the SandWalker went home alone.  We do not have a holocaust cloak or a wheel barrel.
 
Oh, yeah.  I forget to mention we are in a level 7 mana storm.  If he concentrates real hard the area around Morphus (expanding radius, call it 30') can become ordered down to a level of say, mana storm 3 unsing the staff of law.  I can do the same thing in a much smaller radius using enforce reality. Khalid can raise a shield which blocks it out real good but then we cant do anything.
 
First Question:  
 
Is the above summary accurate?
 
Second Question:  
 
How many lethar are in the scouting line and is it a line or do they move back to physically communicate with the main force periodically?
 
Also how big is the main force OOM?  Thousands of undead?  Tens of thousands? Hundreds?  Also how many necromancers could we see?  Any other mages?  Any obvious generals?
 
THE PLAN
 
I think we should set up two groups of mages on opposite sides of the gorge to shoot into the masses when they come between us...
 
No really,  I think we should pick an advance team.  This team (probably Myself, D'Jan, Kor'Keth and Muriel) will dig in on the lee side of the first berm.  The idea is that they will hide and the Lethar will walk right over them whee upon they can appear out of the dust and kill them before they can report back.
 
I though of sticking Arak in the advanced team but his smell of life might be too easily tracked by a Lethar.  I am assuming that Muriel has some secret technique which she can use to remain hidden. Is she a combat babe?  If not there is no reason to force her up front.  Also I am assuming there are not hundreds of Lethar in which case we would be dead.  Tens would even probably kill us.
 
In support of this does anyone ranged attacks which are silent and likely to work in a mana storm (Arak could use missile weapons here if they had enough range).
 
The remainder of my plan was to split the mages into two groups and set them up at the corners of the second berm building a killing field in the valley between.  After our advanced group took out the Lethar we would retreat (probably taking the bodies with us) and allow the main force to come into the valley.  Once the significant players where in the advance force could block forward progress at the second berm and the two mage groups could lay waste to every one with debilitating cross fire.  We should just avoid anything as destructive as a bolt of damnation again (though it worked great before).
 
It would be nice to mine the killing field ahead of time but we would have to e careful that the Lethar or the advance team did not set them off by accident or the main host would be warned.  We also might want to consider whether we have a mop up plan if we do manage to kill off the big baddies.  Clean up on a huge horde could be tough and it would be really nice if there were no survivors.
 
Unfortunately my belief, based on past experience, is that the minute someone significant dies The Liche will know his past (unless Morphus can pull some cool Orb Ops to suck them souls).  Thus, though I don't think they will be fast we could face reinforcements.  We should have an escape plan.
 
I suggest the following for the two fire groups:
 
Morphus, Kilsorana, E-Man, Storm Warden
Arak, Mordenaith, Khalid, Mr. Justicar
 
Anything else?  What attack modes do people plan to use?  I am going to be almost exclusively physical this battle.

"Re: Tactical Situation","Initially I think it is really important to take out the vargoyle
(invisible dragon type critter) and I think that the plan is already for
Khalid to throw a trigger web on it and then burn the hell out of it.
E-man will be backing up Khalid to help him with his throw and to fan the
flames...Kilsorana is going to grow arms and a working voicebox right at
the beginning of the run...

Webs are extremely effective against hordes and if you want I can be crowd
control but they ain't subtle is all I have to say unless I spend extra
points to make them invisible... (can do/ just need to know how important
stealth is)...  I think that E-man, Khalid and I could make a devastating
web team (I make acidic, sticky, extremely flamable, maybe throw light in
for good measure) huge web...E-man makes it fly and Khalid burns the hell
out of it...

Everyone else can concentrate on the preceptors and other leaders..

How does that sound??

My Plans were very basic:
Using a buried line (physical probably silver thread) I intend to remotely
(10-15m) manage an illusion of myself (including some limited
casting using the sun-bane flare and such) . My intent is to take advantage
of my status as primo target to get the
high power sources to blast away at the illusion. Hopefuly this will give
me
an opening for a counter punch
of some sort.
Otherwise I had some suggestions:
I have two sun-bane triggers that could be internally hidden by the Fortu
and then used as necessary.
The down side is that they are very powerful and the side-effects are
likely
to be in proportion.
Also, I believe that I can make a decent set of mines based on light and
life that would be pretty nasty (just hard to
hide )
A Big Question for me is :
Why is this force sortying ? A land force of this composition strikes me as
being more useful against
some sort of massed troops (Brigade and such) that we haven't really seen.
Otherwise I would expect that the
high-power baddies would simply head where they needed to be at a fast
clip.
Do they need these troops as
screening forces ? to overwhelm a highpower good guy whose primary skill is
in melee ?
I would love to have some idea of what their mission is . It would help use
counter them. We might be able to screw
the up simply by delaying them. Slagging them is all to the good but it may
not be the best move.

    For assets on our side we have: Sigmund, Kor'Keth, D'Jan, Mordenaith,
Morphus, E-Man, Khalid, Arack, Mr. Justicar(whats his name?), Kilsorana
(the
talking horse), Muriel and the Storm Warden.  As I recall neither Pentos or
Peter came and the SandWalker went home alone.  We do not have a holocaust
cloak or a wheel barrel.
    Oh, yeah.  I forget to mention we are in a level 7 mana storm.  If he
concentrates real hard the area around Morphus (expanding radius, call it
30') can become ordered down to a level of say, mana storm 3 unsing the
staff of law.  I can do the same thing in a much smaller radius using
enforce reality. Khalid can raise a shield which blocks it out real good
but
then we cant do anything.
    First Question:
    Is the above summary accurate?
    Second Question:
    How many lethar are in the scouting line and is it a line or do they
move back to physically communicate with the main force periodically?
    Also how big is the main force OOM?  Thousands of undead?  Tens of
thousands? Hundreds?  Also how many necromancers could we see?  Any other
mages?  Any obvious generals?
    THE PLAN
    I think we should set up two groups of mages on opposite sides of the
gorge to shoot into the masses when they come between us...
    No really,  I think we should pick an advance team.  This team
(probably
Myself, D'Jan, Kor'Keth and Muriel) will dig in on the lee side of the
first
berm.  The idea is that they will hide and the Lethar will walk right over
them whee upon they can appear out of the dust and kill them before they
can
report back.
    I though of sticking Arak in the advanced team but his smell of life
might be too easily tracked by a Lethar.  I am assuming that Muriel has
some
secret technique which she can use to remain hidden. Is she a combat babe?
If not there is no reason to force her up front.  Also I am assuming there
are not hundreds of Lethar in which case we would be dead.  Tens would even
probably kill us.
    In support of this does anyone ranged attacks which are silent and
likely to work in a mana storm (Arak could use missile weapons here if they
had enough range).
    The remainder of my plan was to split the mages into two groups and set
them up at the corners of the second berm building a killing field in the
valley between.  After our advanced group took out the Lethar we would
retreat (probably taking the bodies with us) and allow the main force to
come into the valley.  Once the significant players where in the advance
force could block forward progress at the second berm and the two mage
groups could lay waste to every one with debilitating cross fire.  We
should
just avoid anything as destructive as a bolt of damnation again (though it
worked great before).
    It would be nice to mine the killing field ahead of time but we would
have to e careful that the Lethar or the advance team did not set them off
by accident or the main host would be warned.  We also might want to
consider whether we have a mop up plan if we do manage to kill off the big
baddies.  Clean up on a huge horde could be tough and it would be really
nice if there were no survivors.
    Unfortunately my belief, based on past experience, is that the minute
someone significant dies The Liche will know his past (unless Morphus can
pull some cool Orb Ops to suck them souls).  Thus, though I don't think
they
will be fast we could face reinforcements.  We should have an escape plan.
    I suggest the following for the two fire groups:
    Morphus, Kilsorana, E-Man, Storm Warden
    Arak, Mordenaith, Khalid, Mr. Justicar
    Anything else?  What attack modes do people plan to use?  I am going to
be almost exclusively physical this battle.

    Subject: Tactical Situation



    You know, it just occured to me that we are going into a
highly dangerous tactical situation this Sunday and it might be
very beneficial to have a plan.


    [Myth]
    What are you, some kind of revisionist?

    Here is the situation as I remember it.  We are located in a
wide gully.  The gully is more than a mile wide but the main
corridor (flat section) is only about 900 yds wide, to the side of
which are rising slopes.  The sides of the gully are probably
cliffs but I suspect that tactically they will be out of the
picture.

    We are situated at a spot in the gully where two berms (small
rises in the terrain) cross the gully floor.  The berms are
aproximately 300 yds apart and are tall enough to block LOS of
normal humans (and probably even the big guy).


    [Myth]
    I was under the impression that it was 1. Army of Darkness
                                                            2.
Hill to hide behind
                                                            3. Us
                                                            4.
Hill to retreat behind

    Though all that I remember firmly is that it was a spectacular
spot for our purposes.

    There is a large army aproaching the area from (lets call it
for the sake of argument) the west.  This army consists of a large
number of undead, mostly ghouls with a few ghasts (or was it
mostly zombies with a few ghouls).  There are also a small number
of Necromancers and a large proto-dragon in the lead.  The
proto-dragon seems to have the reality mass profile of a small
dragon but appears much more physical rather than magical.  We
have no information about it's intelligence.  The head of the army
is 1 mile away.  1/4 mile away is a line of lethar scouts
preceding the main troops.  The following troop composition was
obtained by Kor'Keth on a scouting mission.

    For assets on our side we have: Sigmund, Kor'Keth, D'Jan,
Mordenaith, Morphus, E-Man, Khalid, Arack, Mr. Justicar(whats his
name?), Kilsorana (the talking horse), Muriel and the Storm
Warden.  As I recall neither Pentos or Peter came and the
SandWalker went home alone.  We do not have a holocaust cloak or a
wheel barrel.


    [Myth]
    Rujah the Sentinel.  He's a nice boy; he deserves to have his
name remembered.
    Well, actually, he deserves enough pay to buy Buckingham
Palace and retire after another week of this, but remembering
names is all I'm willing to do for him now.

    Oh, yeah.  I forget to mention we are in a level 7 mana storm.
If he concentrates real hard the area around Morphus (expanding
radius, call it 30') can become ordered down to a level of say,
mana storm 3 unsing the staff of law.  I can do the same thing in
a much smaller radius using enforce reality. Khalid can raise a
shield which blocks it out real good but then we cant do anything.

    First Question:

    Is the above summary accurate?

    Second Question:

    How many lethar are in the scouting line and is it a line or
do they move back to physically communicate with the main force
periodically?

    Also how big is the main force OOM?  Thousands of undead?
Tens of thousands? Hundreds?  Also how many necromancers could we
see?  Any other mages?  Any obvious generals?

    THE PLAN

    I think we should set up two groups of mages on opposite sides
of the gorge to shoot into the masses when they come between us...

    No really,  I think we should pick an advance team.  This team
(probably Myself, D'Jan, Kor'Keth and Muriel) will dig in on the
lee side of the first berm.  The idea is that they will hide and
the Lethar will walk right over them whee upon they can appear out
 of the dust and kill them before they can report back.


    [Myth]
    Another possibility would be to hide in Khalid's Ward Nine
(from outer space) until the Lethar scouts have sauntered by, then
drop it and explode at the army/vargoyle/random high-level
necromancers and/or preceptors.

    Though I like the idea of a Lethar-sense-proof force outside,
too. This group is too weird not to do stuff like that.  Storm
Warden and Eman could probably disguise themselves as air
elementals (similar to the way he arrived), though I'm sure there
are concurrent risks.

    Letting them by would also give us a two-front war; we'd have
to assign a person or two to Lethar-mopping-up, and the retreat
situation would be a lot hairier.  That almost demands the first
salvo exterminate the pointy-fanged boys in black.  Still, it's an
idea.  (Wait until you're surrounded, then attack from surprise.
Funny, it wasn't in -my- tactical manual.)

    I though of sticking Arak in the advanced team but his smell
of life might be too easily tracked by a Lethar.  I am assuming
that Muriel has some secret technique which she can use to remain
hidden. Is she a combat babe?  If not there is no reason to force
her up front.  Also I am assuming there are not hundreds of Lethar
in which case we would be dead.  Tens would even probably kill us.


    [Myth]
    I'm hoping for not more than two or three dozen.  Also for an
area attack spell (ours).

    In support of this does anyone ranged attacks which are silent
and likely to work in a mana storm (Arak could use missile weapons
here if they had enough range).


    [Myth]
    I've been contemplating using a sheath of my own Power to
maintain a context-generating field around a distance-attack
spell.  Failing that, there's always the improvisational Sorcery
stuff-- whip up some sand, melt it into shards, and throw it at
them at supersonic velocities.  Crude, but cuisinart.

    The remainder of my plan was to split the mages into two
groups and set them up at the corners of the second berm building
a killing field in the valley between.  After our advanced group
took out the Lethar we would retreat (probably taking the bodies
with us) and allow the main force to come into the valley.  Once
the significant players where in the advance force could block
forward progress at the second berm and the two mage groups could
lay waste to every one with debilitating cross fire.  We should
just avoid anything as destructive as a bolt of damnation again
(though it worked great before).


    [Myth]
    My major worry about a Bolt would be the incidental reality
damage.  I think it would really muck things up.

    It would be nice to mine the killing field ahead of time but
we would have to e careful that the Lethar or the advance team did
not set them off by accident or the main host would be warned.  We
also might want to consider whether we have a mop up plan if we do
manage to kill off the big baddies.  Clean up on a huge horde
could be tough and it would be really nice if there were no
survivors.


    [Myth]
    Maybe a geomantic attack?  Channel power into the
ground -here- and make it explode -there-, -there-, and (oh yeah)
over -there-.  Might be fun for Morphus to try, if we're not
letting him play with his Bolt.

    Unfortunately my belief, based on past experience, is that the
minute someone significant dies The Liche will know his past
(unless Morphus can pull some cool Orb Ops to suck them souls).
Thus, though I don't think they will be fast we could face
reinforcements.  We should have an escape plan.


    [Myth]
    Um... run very, very fast?

    Or calm the local mana enough for Storm Warden to do his
elemental transport bit and flee flying.

    Avoid Valhalla and the Halls of the Dead.  Also the typical
Gate and Teleport spells.  Dunno how close we are to Faery here,
but maybe Mordanith could suggest something.

    I suggest the following for the two fire groups:

    Morphus, Kilsorana, E-Man, Storm Warden
    Arak, Mordenaith, Khalid, Mr. Justicar


    [Myth]
    Hm.  It occurs to me that Eman, Khalid, and Storm Warden would
make a pretty awesome elemental team.  OTOH, Eman seems to make a
good team with anyone.

    I see you've tried for two balanced teams here.  It might be
better to put Morphus and Mordanith together, as they can survive
whatever they're likely to start.  With a little distance, we can
probably use Khalid's warding if they break anything Real, and (to
be blunt) the rest of us could probably match their firepower.

    Though, if we're hiding in Khalid's ward while the Lethar
scout past (or at least around), it might be calm enough for Eman
to build another Abjurational Blasting Shield.  Kinda blows my
cover with the Storm Warden, but I suspect it's an open secret at
those levels of magery anyhow.


    Anything else?  What attack modes do people plan to use?  I am
going to be almost exclusively physical this battle.


    [Myth]
    I am not.  Rank 4 in sword (and whip) or not, this is not a
good crowd to start playing Barbarian Hero with for me.

    I will be playing minor abjurational tricks to try and counter
some of this environment, using a lot of elemental stuff, and
trying to keep it to a few really effective casts to minimize the
chances of turning into a horse (of course.)


                                               -Eman, Junior
Battlemage.

                                                                3. Us
                                                                4. Hill to retreat behind 
         
        Though all that I remember firmly is that it was a spectacular spot for our purposes.
        
        [Pook]
        Well, yes it is but we actually have a choice about we stand and I think it would be better to have us firing into a big bowl of baddies with them having to run up hill to get us or get away.
         
        There is a large army aproaching the area from (lets call it for the sake of argument) the west.

        Oh, yeah.  I forget to mention we are in a level 7 mana storm.

        [Pook]
        I am not keen on using ward nine.  Having been outside of it recently I know that it is a large and very obviuous grey globe.  This would pretty much mean that all of the bad guys would know where to target at the tight clustered group inside when they decide to emerge.
         
        Though I like the idea of a Lethar-sense-proof force outside, too. This group is too weird not to do stuff like that.  Storm Warden and Eman could probably disguise themselves as air elementals (similar to the way he arrived), though I'm sure there are concurrent risks.
        
        [Pook]
        That might be worthwhile.  Not as a hide and let the lethar pass us strategy so much as the arial bombardment technique.  No reason not to think three dimensionally.  As long as what is keeping you in the air is not magic (which it wouldn't be if you were an elemental).  The dangers are (a) what are your attack modes as an elemental and (b) aren't deathlords and necromancers likely to be strong in air as well since air and death are so related.
         
        Letting them by would also give us a two-front war; we'd have to assign a person or two to Lethar-mopping-up, and the retreat situation would be a lot hairier.  That almost demands the first salvo exterminate the pointy-fanged boys in black.  Still, it's an idea.  (Wait until you're surrounded, then attack from surprise.  Funny, it wasn't in -my- tactical manual.)
        
        [Pook]
        My (questionable) plan was to attack the lethar from two sides (avoiding huge area spells which would toast our own forces) with enough rapidity that we could have dealt with them completely before the main force arrives.  This requires stealth in the attack and a small number of lether.  If it is successful it means we can unify our forces before meeting the main horde and we are much stronger plus we have suprise.  This is definately a ninja/commando tactic rather than a battlefield tactic.
        
        I though of sticking Arak in the advanced team but his smell of life might be too easily tracked by a Lethar.  I am assuming that Muriel has some secret technique which she can use to remain hidden. Is she a combat babe?  If not there is no reason to force her up front.  Also I am assuming there are not hundreds of Lethar in which case we would be dead.  Tens would even probably kill us.

        [Pook]
        Both those tactics are good.  Sheathing a spell will keep it alive but may be tough to do at extreme ranges.  Creating local magical effects which then physically move to the target and physically do damage is an excellant strategy.  We should look at the fire team break ups to designate who is maintaining order in the vicinity of each group (that would probably require some active concentration on somebodies part, at least florentine mods).
        
        
        The remainder of my plan was to split the mages into two groups and set them up at the corners of the second berm building a killing field in the valley between.  After our advanced group took out the Lethar we would retreat (probably taking the bodies with us) and allow the main force to come into the valley.

We should just avoid anything as destructive as a bolt of damnation again (though it worked great before).
        
         
        [Myth] 
        My major worry about a Bolt would be the incidental reality damage.  I think it would really muck things up. 
        
        
        It would be nice to mine the killing field ahead of time but we would have to e careful that the Lethar or the advance team did not set them off by accident or the main host would be warned.

        [Pook]
        Sounds good, but I tried that in the last battle just before Morphus's bolt went off and I could not make the range (admittedly long) becuase of the mana storm.  We have to take those things into account.
         
        Unfortunately my belief, based on past experience, is that the minute someone significant dies The Liche will know his past (unless Morphus can pull some cool Orb Ops to suck them souls).  Thus, though I don't think they will be fast we could face reinforcements.  We should have an escape plan.
        
         
        [Myth] 
        Um... run very, very fast?

        [Pook]
        All of the above sound good.  I wouldn't count on much faerie hopping but Grellar did walk the pattern to get to Marden from here just before we left.
         
        I suggest the following for the two fire groups:
         
        Morphus, Kilsorana, E-Man, Storm Warden
        Arak, Mordenaith, Khalid, Mr. Justicar
        
         
        [Myth] 
        Hm.  It occurs to me that Eman, Khalid, and Storm Warden would make a pretty awesome elemental team.  OTOH, Eman seems to make a good team with anyone.
         
        I see you've tried for two balanced teams here.  It might be better to put Morphus and Mordanith together, as they can survive whatever they're likely to start.  With a little distance, we can probably use Khalid's warding if they break anything Real, and (to be blunt) the rest of us could probably match their firepower.
         
        Though, if we're hiding in Khalid's ward while the Lethar scout past (or at least around), it might be calm enough for Eman to build another Abjurational Blasting Shield.  Kinda blows my cover with the Storm Warden, but I suspect it's an open secret at those levels of magery anyhow.
        
        [Pook]
        My criteria where (a) make sure each group had some hand-to-hand resources and (b) attempt to balance fire power.  I am open to all sorts of suggestions.
         
        Anything else?  What attack modes do people plan to use?  I am going to be almost exclusively physical this battle.
        
         
        [Myth] 
        I am not.  Rank 4 in sword (and whip) or not, this is not a good crowd to start playing Barbarian Hero with for me. 
         
        I will be playing minor abjurational tricks to try and counter some of this environment, using a lot of elemental stuff, and trying to keep it to a few really effective casts to minimize the chances of turning into a horse (of course.)
         
        
                                                   -Eman, Junior Battlemage.
        [Pook]
         Not!

        Subject: Tactical Situation
        
        
         
        You know, it just occured to me that we are going into a highly dangerous tactical situation this Sunday and it might be very beneficial to have a plan.
        
        Yup 
        
        Here is the situation as I remember it.  We are located in a wide gully.  The gully is more than a mile wide but the main corridor (flat section) is only about 900 yds wide, to the side of which are rising slopes.  The sides of the gully are probably cliffs but I suspect that tactically they will be out of the picture.
         
        We are situated at a spot in the gully where two berms (small rises in the terrain) cross the gully floor.  The berms are aproximately 300 yds apart and are tall enough to block LOS of normal humans (and probably even the big guy).
         
        There is a large army aproaching the area from (lets call it for the sake of argument) the west.  This army consists of a large number of undead, mostly ghouls with a few ghasts (or was it mostly zombies with a few ghouls).  There are also a small number of Necromancers and a large proto-dragon in the lead.  The proto-dragon seems to have the reality mass profile of a small dragon but appears much more physical rather than magical.  We have no information about it's intelligence.  The head of the army is 1 mile away.  1/4 mile away is a line of lethar scouts preceding the main troops.  The following troop composition was obtained by Kor'Keth on a scouting mission.
         
        For assets on our side we have: Sigmund, Kor'Keth, D'Jan, Mordenaith, Morphus, E-Man, Khalid, Arack, Mr. Justicar(whats his name?), Kilsorana (the talking horse), Muriel and the Storm Warden.  As I recall neither Pentos or Peter came and the SandWalker went home alone.  We do not have a holocaust cloak or a wheel barrel.
         
        I believ you are referring to the Sentinel ?
        
        [Pook]
        Yup, sorry
         
        Oh, yeah.  I forget to mention we are in a level 7 mana storm.  If he concentrates real hard the area around Morphus (expanding radius, call it 30') can become ordered down to a level of say, mana storm 3 unsing the staff of law.  I can do the same thing in a much smaller radius using enforce reality. Khalid can raise a shield which blocks it out real good but then we cant do anything.
         
        I believe at this point we are in a level 4-5 that is brought down to level 2-3 (large amounts of variation)
        
        [Pook]
        I don't think so.  We should check with Alex but I thought the storm was pretty extreme except in our local vicinity.  I thought we could bring it down to 4-5 with a casual effort and 2-3 if Chris does the staff of law thing again, but there is a risk to that.  I think we should only reduce the storm directly around our prepared positions.  If The horde walks into an area and suddenly the chaos level drops dramatically they are going to get suspicious and will probably start to do annoying things like contact the scouts or try flanking manuevers.
        
        First Question:  
         
        Is the above summary accurate?
         
        I think the ground is alittle different from what you describe. I will dig out my notes.
        
        [Pook]
        I drew a map and ran it by Alex at the end of the last run but it only included the two berms and the area between as well as the distances to the troops.  I am remembering the fact that it was in a gorge and I may have gotten the proprotions of that wrong.  I made up the fact that the troops are coming from the west (the traditional land of the dead) and that we are on the east.  If you come downstairs I can show you the map I have.
         
        Second Question:  
         
        How many lethar are in the scouting line and is it a line or do they move back to physically communicate with the main force periodically?
         
        Also how big is the main force OOM?  Thousands of undead?  Tens of thousands? Hundreds?  Also how many necromancers could we see?  Any other mages?  Any obvious generals?
         
        There were two major power sources (Necromancers ? Deathlords ?)
        
         
        Several Lethar 
         
        One Invisible Creature.
        
        [Pook]
        Did we have numbers on the Necromancers?  Death Lords?  Did you say multiple Death Lords?  Yikes.
        
        We should get numbers on the Lethar.
        
        The big invisible creature is the Vargoyle.  I forgot that it was invisibile.  It is going to be tough to target (speaking from the perspective of an invisible tough to target creature).
         
        THE PLAN
         
        I think we should set up two groups of mages on opposite sides of the gorge to shoot into the masses when they come between us...
         
        No really,  I think we should pick an advance team.  This team (probably Myself, D'Jan, Kor'Keth and Muriel) will dig in on the lee side of the first berm.  The idea is that they will hide and the Lethar will walk right over them whee upon they can appear out of the dust and kill them before they can report back.
         
        I though of sticking Arak in the advanced team but his smell of life might be too easily tracked by a Lethar.  I am assuming that Muriel has some secret technique which she can use to remain hidden. Is she a combat babe?  If not there is no reason to force her up front.  Also I am assuming there are not hundreds of Lethar in which case we would be dead.  Tens would even probably kill us.
         
        In support of this does anyone ranged attacks which are silent and likely to work in a mana storm (Arak could use missile weapons here if they had enough range).
         
        The remainder of my plan was to split the mages into two groups and set them up at the corners of the second berm building a killing field in the valley between.  After our advanced group took out the Lethar we would retreat (probably taking the bodies with us) and allow the main force to come into the valley.  Once the significant players where in the advance force could block forward progress at the second berm and the two mage groups could lay waste to every one with debilitating cross fire.  We should just avoid anything as destructive as a bolt of damnation again (though it worked great before).
         
        It would be nice to mine the killing field ahead of time but we would have to e careful that the Lethar or the advance team did not set them off by accident or the main host would be warned.  We also might want to consider whether we have a mop up plan if we do manage to kill off the big baddies.  Clean up on a huge horde could be tough and it would be really nice if there were no survivors.
         
        Unfortunately my belief, based on past experience, is that the minute someone significant dies The Liche will know his past (unless Morphus can pull some cool Orb Ops to suck them souls).  Thus, though I don't think they will be fast we could face reinforcements.  We should have an escape plan.
         
        I suggest the following for the two fire groups:
         
        Morphus, Kilsorana, E-Man, Storm Warden
        Arak, Mordenaith, Khalid, Mr. Justicar
         
        Anything else?  What attack modes do people plan to use?  I am going to be almost exclusively physical this battle.

    Initially I think it is really important to take out the vargoyle
    (invisible dragon type critter) and I think that the plan is already for
    Khalid to throw a trigger web on it and then burn the hell out of it.
    E-man will be backing up Khalid to help him with his throw and to fan the
    flames...Kilsorana is going to grow arms and a working voicebox right at
    the beginning of the run...
    
    [Pook]
    Excellant plan.  We should, of course, make sure that after all of the planning frenzy finishes the various participants are still aligned that that is what they are doing.  Also, not so much for you but for Khalid and E-man in this scenario, range is going to be an issue becuase of the chaos storm.
    BTW:  Doea Kilsorana have actual knowledge of Vargoyles?  If so can you fill us in while we are setting up.  After all I think all we know at the moment is that the horde is led by a giant invisible creature.  Do we even know it is draconic?
    
    Webs are extremely effective against hordes and if you want I can be crowd
    control but they ain't subtle is all I have to say unless I spend extra
    points to make them invisible... (can do/ just need to know how important
    stealth is)...  I think that E-man, Khalid and I could make a devastating
    web team (I make acidic, sticky, extremely flamable, maybe throw light in
    for good measure) huge web...E-man makes it fly and Khalid burns the hell
    out of it...
    [Pook]
    I think subtly is essential when we hit the Lethar.  Once we are hacking the main horde I do not think subtelty is an issue.  My concern is that we should not use attacks which will go wild if they backfire in the chaos storm.
    
    Everyone else can concentrate on the preceptors and other leaders..
    [Pook]
    Preceptors?  What preceptors?  I don't remember any of them?
    
    How does that sound??

    Subject: RE: Tactical Situation
    
    
    My Plans were very basic:
     
    Using a buried line (physical probably silver thread) I intend to remotely (10-15m) manage an illusion of myself (including some limited 
    casting using the sun-bane flare and such) . My intent is to take advantage of my status as primo target to get the 
    high power sources to blast away at the illusion. Hopefuly this will give me an opening for a counter punch 
    of some sort.
    
    [Pook]
    Sounds good, if obscenely difficult, to me.
     
    Otherwise I had some suggestions:
     
    I have two sun-bane triggers that could be internally hidden by the Fortu and then used as necessary. 
    The down side is that they are very powerful and the side-effects are likely to be in proportion.
    
    [Pook]
    Are these beam weapons or radius blasts?  Do you need to be a mage to use one?
     
    Also, I believe that I can make a decent set of mines based on light and life that would be pretty nasty (just hard to
    hide )
    
    [Pook]
    If you do this I think you would need to use some of your order potions to prevent them from going off prematurely.  At army advancement speeds we should have some time between Lethar impact and Horde impact.  If we assume they are moving at 2'/ct [ALEX? - There are zombies in the horde] and there is a 3/4 mi gap (~3900 ft) that gives us about 6.5 minutes to deal with the lethar and set up before the horde crests the hill.  Boy, that is shorter than I expected.
     
    A Big Question for me is :
     
    Why is this force sortying ? A land force of this composition strikes me as being more useful against 
    some sort of massed troops (Brigade and such) that we haven't really seen. Otherwise I would expect that the 
    high-power baddies would simply head where they needed to be at a fast clip. Do they need these troops as 
    screening forces ? to overwhelm a highpower good guy whose primary skill is in melee ?
     
    I would love to have some idea of what their mission is . It would help use counter them. We might be able to screw 
    the up simply by delaying them. Slagging them is all to the good but it may not be the best move.
    
    [Pook]
    
    Excellant questions.

        You know, it just occured to me that we are going into a highly dangerous tactical situation this Sunday and it might be very beneficial to have a plan.
         
        Here is the situation as I remember it.  We are located in a wide gully.  The gully is more than a mile wide but the main corridor (flat section) is only about 900 yds wide, to the side of which are rising slopes.  The sides of the gully are probably cliffs but I suspect that tactically they will be out of the picture.
         
        We are situated at a spot in the gully where two berms (small rises in the terrain) cross the gully floor.  The berms are aproximately 300 yds apart and are tall enough to block LOS of normal humans (and probably even the big guy).
         
        There is a large army aproaching the area from (lets call it for the sake of argument) the west.  This army consists of a large number of undead, mostly ghouls with a few ghasts (or was it mostly zombies with a few ghouls).  There are also a small number of Necromancers and a large proto-dragon in the lead.  The proto-dragon seems to have the reality mass profile of a small dragon but appears much more physical rather than magical.  We have no information about it's intelligence.  The head of the army is 1 mile away.  1/4 mile away is a line of lethar scouts preceding the main troops.  The following troop composition was obtained by Kor'Keth on a scouting mission.
         
        For assets on our side we have: Sigmund, Kor'Keth, D'Jan, Mordenaith, Morphus, E-Man, Khalid, Arack, Mr. Justicar(whats his name?), Kilsorana (the talking horse), Muriel and the Storm Warden.  As I recall neither Pentos or Peter came and the SandWalker went home alone.  We do not have a holocaust cloak or a wheel barrel.
         
        Oh, yeah.  I forget to mention we are in a level 7 mana storm.  If he concentrates real hard the area around Morphus (expanding radius, call it 30') can become ordered down to a level of say, mana storm 3 unsing the staff of law.  I can do the same thing in a much smaller radius using enforce reality. Khalid can raise a shield which blocks it out real good but then we cant do anything.
         
        First Question:  
         
        Is the above summary accurate?
         
        Second Question:  
         
        How many lethar are in the scouting line and is it a line or do they move back to physically communicate with the main force periodically?
         
        Also how big is the main force OOM?  Thousands of undead?  Tens of thousands? Hundreds?  Also how many necromancers could we see?  Any other mages?  Any obvious generals?
         
        THE PLAN
         
        I think we should set up two groups of mages on opposite sides of the gorge to shoot into the masses when they come between us...
         
        No really,  I think we should pick an advance team.  This team (probably Myself, D'Jan, Kor'Keth and Muriel) will dig in on the lee side of the first berm.  The idea is that they will hide and the Lethar will walk right over them whee upon they can appear out of the dust and kill them before they can report back.
         
        I though of sticking Arak in the advanced team but his smell of life might be too easily tracked by a Lethar.  I am assuming that Muriel has some secret technique which she can use to remain hidden. Is she a combat babe?  If not there is no reason to force her up front.  Also I am assuming there are not hundreds of Lethar in which case we would be dead.  Tens would even probably kill us.
         
        In support of this does anyone ranged attacks which are silent and likely to work in a mana storm (Arak could use missile weapons here if they had enough range).
         
        The remainder of my plan was to split the mages into two groups and set them up at the corners of the second berm building a killing field in the valley between.  After our advanced group took out the Lethar we would retreat (probably taking the bodies with us) and allow the main force to come into the valley.  Once the significant players where in the advance force could block forward progress at the second berm and the two mage groups could lay waste to every one with debilitating cross fire.  We should just avoid anything as destructive as a bolt of damnation again (though it worked great before).
         
        It would be nice to mine the killing field ahead of time but we would have to e careful that the Lethar or the advance team did not set them off by accident or the main host would be warned.  We also might want to consider whether we have a mop up plan if we do manage to kill off the big baddies.  Clean up on a huge horde could be tough and it would be really nice if there were no survivors.
         
        Unfortunately my belief, based on past experience, is that the minute someone significant dies The Liche will know his past (unless Morphus can pull some cool Orb Ops to suck them souls).  Thus, though I don't think they will be fast we could face reinforcements.  We should have an escape plan.
         
        I suggest the following for the two fire groups:
         
        Morphus, Kilsorana, E-Man, Storm Warden
        Arak, Mordenaith, Khalid, Mr. Justicar
         
        Anything else?  What attack modes do people plan to use?  I am going to be almost exclusively physical this battle.

    There was  a break in the wall around firemountain and that is where they
    are pouring from..
    
    My guess is that this is directly related to the battle of the Lich
    attemtpting to increase hole in the bridge and this could be a distraction
    technique for that or simply a 'Go Get Em"" plan... it does not seem to me
    that the Lich has a problem with his number of forces..

    Sounds likely to me.  Of course it might be interesting to note where this pass goes.  We should have that information.  Dao-Shoa?

    My Plans were very basic:
    Using a buried line (physical probably silver thread) I intend to remotely
    (10-15m) manage an illusion of myself (including some limited
    casting using the sun-bane flare and such) . My intent is to take advantage
    of my status as primo target to get the
    high power sources to blast away at the illusion. Hopefuly this will give
    me
    an opening for a counter punch
    of some sort.
    Otherwise I had some suggestions:
    I have two sun-bane triggers that could be internally hidden by the Fortu
    and then used as necessary.
    The down side is that they are very powerful and the side-effects are
    likely
    to be in proportion.
    Also, I believe that I can make a decent set of mines based on light and
    life that would be pretty nasty (just hard to
    hide )
    A Big Question for me is :
    Why is this force sortying ? A land force of this composition strikes me as
    being more useful against
    some sort of massed troops (Brigade and such) that we haven't really seen.
    Otherwise I would expect that the
    high-power baddies would simply head where they needed to be at a fast
    clip.
    Do they need these troops as
    screening forces ? to overwhelm a highpower good guy whose primary skill is
    in melee ?
    I would love to have some idea of what their mission is . It would help use
    counter them. We might be able to screw
    the up simply by delaying them. Slagging them is all to the good but it may
    not be the best move.

        [Jim JM]
        I would welcome any suggestion that did not involve me as
the defensive nexus of the party.


        [Myth]
        I agree.  Mordanith is much better as an offensive nexus.


        [Pook]
        Are these beam weapons or radius blasts?  Do you need to
be a mage to use one?

        [Jim JM]
        Beam weapons. Greater spread than a shotgun but not much
greater (normally).
        Just aim, pull down the trigger guard collar and press the
button. Shielding the eyes
        is sometimes a good idea.


        [Myth]
        While these are great against Lethar,  I'm not sure they
are subtle enough for that.  If I were running an army (even a
zombie army), I'd be suspicious if my scouts went over a ridge,
there was a big flask of light, and nobody reported back.

         Also, I believe that I can make a decent set of mines
based on light and life that would be pretty nasty (just hard to
        hide )

        [Pook]
        If you do this I think you would need to use some of your
order potions to prevent them from going off prematurely.  At army
advancement speeds we should have some time between Lethar impact
and Horde impact.  If we assume they are moving at 2'/ct [ALEX? -
There are zombies in the horde] and there is a 3/4 mi gap (~3900
ft) that gives us about 6.5 minutes to deal with the lethar and
set up before the horde crests the hill.  Boy, that is shorter
than I expected.


        [Myth]
        6.5 minutes?  After what we did in the castle in 2.5
seconds?  We'll have time for a fight, a breakfast buffet, some
landscaping and a nice in-your-face ritual to meet Pete's Dragon
(TM by Disney) and his zombie hordes!

        Okay, I exaggerate.  But that is a long time in BT combat.
I might even be able to get in a spell or two.


        A Big Question for me is :

        Why is this force sortying ? A land force of this
composition strikes me as being more useful against
        some sort of massed troops (Brigade and such) that we
haven't really seen. Otherwise I would expect that the
        high-power baddies would simply head where they needed to
be at a fast clip. Do they need these troops as
        screening forces ? to overwhelm a highpower good guy whose
primary skill is in melee ?

        I would love to have some idea of what their mission is .
It would help use counter them. We might be able to screw
        the up simply by delaying them. Slagging them is all to
the good but it may not be the best move.

        [Pook]

        Excellant questions.


        [Myth]
        I agree.  Excellent questions.  But we may not have the
time (despite previous comments) to do good research here,
especially through divinatory means.  If the local future here
isn't some sort of temporal soup, I'll eat my turban.

        While I'm commenting, I think the Ward Nine (I know,
Britt, not the real number.  But it sounds cool.) might be a good
place to do some of the more delicate setup stuff.  Storm Warden
has stated that he can't do that Elemental thing for the whole
party in this mana storm, and I'm not sure I could set up the ABS
(Abjurational Blasting Shield) easily in one, though it could
probably maintain after fairly well.

        I would suggest the following distribution:


        Phase One: Lethar Away

        Somehow ambush scouts, and destroy them well and subtly
enough so the army doesn't catch on.

        Mordanith, Khalid - blasters
        Kilsorana - hampering the opposition by further
destabilizing their environment
        Morphus - hoovering up lost souls with his Orb.
        Various Fortu - physical combatants
        Storm Warden - making sure they don't escape
        Erithmaeon - damping the output so the army doesn't see
        Rujah - watcher
        Muriel?


        Phase Two: Get 'Em

        Wait for unsuspecting army (back up one ridge to prepared
position?) and Let 'Em Have It.

        Khalid (with Web trigger), two Fortu (with Sunbane
triggers), Mordanith, Morphus - blasters
        Erithmaeon, Kilsorana, Storm Lord - defense, second salvo

        After that it gets hard to predict.  I'd assign Khalid to
general mayhem (sandblasting the army, perhaps), Morphus,
Mordanith, and Kilsorana to more specific mayhem (vargoyles and
necromancers), Rujah as spotter, Erithmaeon and Storm Warden to
defense, and Muriel and the Fortu to whatever seems to fit their
needs and abilities.

        The more I think about it, the more I like Eman having the
ABS up and holding down the Utility Mage spot.

                                                   -Myth, now in
COLOR!

        Another thought-- an air shield connecting the two berms,
with dirt on top.  Let the scouts walk over us, then attack from
below, or drop 'em, or drop 'em and resolidify the shield leaving
'em stuck, or something else creative, petty, and cruel.

"Re: Tactical Situation","Summary of the important info I noticed from here:

Muriel can hide well therefor I think the advanced team should be Me, Kor'Keth,D'Jan, Muriel

The main troop forces are:
20,000+    Zombies
200+        Ghouls
5-10        Ghasts (some?)
~20         Ogres
6-7        Necromantic blips in a cluster near the front (command group)
<10        Necromantic blips scattered throughout the force (some?)
1            Invisible Dragon Like Creature of Unknown Capacities

Scout forces are:
10-20    Lethar

Arak will be deadly but shines like a beacon (both becuase of his Paladin hood)

I was wrong about the mana storm.  It is not as bad as in the previous battle.  Good for us, good for them.

You know, this force is looking much larger than I had imagined at first.  Does anybody have any stats on Ghouls and Ghasts.  All I know is that they are faster than zombies.

I am still for the kill the Lethar and then suprise the main force plan but I think we might want to be prepared to deal them a deadly blow and then run rather than wiping them off the face of the earth.  The 20,000+ Zombies are not what worries me so much as the ~20 Ogres and ~15 Necromantic blips.  Lump that on top of the Dragon, Ghasts and a small horde of ghouls and we have quite a challenge in front of us.

"Re: SHifters: Some more answers...","As far as doing a SEEING to find out the Lethar formations or the visibility of the Big Dude I am planning to do an old fashioned style seeing (with the eyeballs).  I suspect that if I find a good crest I can probably get two or three mile visibility (unless the mana storm makes that tough).  I was planning on scouting both these things out.  The only question is whether that would involve me (and possibly the advanced team) moving ahead of our current position or just hanging out from our protected positions and viewing the troops oncoming.

If we do scout ahead I have no intention of moving through the Lethar scout line (more like finding a spot with a long field of view ahead of them and then checking things at range and running).  In either case I think the hardest part (assuming the mana storm does not detract from visibility too much) will be finding a stretch of canyon which is straight for a mile so we can see the troops without going past the Lethar.  I do not think it needs to be flat for a mile since if it isn't I can just climb the hills to the side to get some elevation.  On the other hand I doubt it is straight where we are or the lethar would probably be pulling the same stunt and it would not be that good an ambush site.

The storm warden could also probably do a fly over in elemental form for more reconaissance.  We should also check to make sure they don;t have arial scouts. (paranoid man strikes again).

6.5 minutes?  After what we did in the castle in 2.5 seconds?  We'll have time for a fight, a breakfast buffet, some landscaping and a nice in-your-face ritual to meet Pete's Dragon (TM by Disney) and his zombie hordes!
 
Okay, I exaggerate.  But that is a long time in BT combat.  I might even be able to get in a spell or two.
 
[Jim]
Actually with Alex's new time rate estimates  0.5 ft/ct instead of 2 ft/ct we should have 26 minutes.  Of course this is 26 minutes to set up stuff over a big area.  This is not combat actions.  Plus we have some Lethar crunching to do at the beginning and we do not want to work up until the end or the horde might get suspicious.  

Also:

[Myth]
Phase One: Lethar Away
 
Somehow ambush scouts, and destroy them well and subtly enough so the army doesn't catch on.
 
Mordanith, Khalid - blasters
>>>Good plan but we want to make sure that blasters don't blast the physical combatants.  Not a problem, just requires care and finesse.
Kilsorana - hampering the opposition by further destabilizing their environment
>>>Sounds scary
Morphus - hoovering up lost souls with his Orb.
>>>That would be really good if we can do it
Various Fortu - physical combatants
>>>I think for the purposes of this battle we should count Muriel as a Fortu if she doesn't mind
Storm Warden - making sure they don't escape
>>>Really useful if he can do it
Erithmaeon - damping the output so the army doesn't see
>>>OK, how?
Rujah - watcher
Muriel?
 

Phase Two: Get 'Em
 
Wait for unsuspecting army (back up one ridge to prepared position?) and Let 'Em Have It.
 
Khalid (with Web trigger), two Fortu (with Sunbane triggers), Mordanith, Morphus - blasters
Erithmaeon, Kilsorana, Storm Lord - defense, second salvo
 
After that it gets hard to predict.  I'd assign Khalid to general mayhem (sandblasting the army, perhaps), Morphus, Mordanith, and Kilsorana to more specific mayhem (vargoyles and necromancers), Rujah as spotter, Erithmaeon and Storm Warden to defense, and Muriel and the Fortu to whatever seems to fit their needs and abilities.

>>Sounds good as a general plan.  I was thinking of doing some physical combat against key targets but definately not until the first salvo has completed.
 
The more I think about it, the more I like Eman having the ABS up and holding down the Utility Mage spot.
>>>Works for me
 
                                           -Myth, now in COLOR!

Another thought-- an air shield connecting the two berms, with dirt on top.  Let the scouts walk over us, then attack from below, or drop 'em, or drop 'em and resolidify the shield leaving 'em stuck, or something else creative, petty, and cruel.
>>>Creative but I think this owuld be a bad idea.  Two large an area for a mana storm and too likely that the Lethar would detect it.

            [Jim JM] 
            I would welcome any suggestion that did not involve me as the defensive nexus of the party. 
            
             
            [Myth] 
            I agree.  Mordanith is much better as an offensive nexus. 
             
            
            [Pook]
            Are these beam weapons or radius blasts?  Do you need to be a mage to use one?
            
            [Jim JM] 
            Beam weapons. Greater spread than a shotgun but not much greater (normally).
            Just aim, pull down the trigger guard collar and press the button. Shielding the eyes 
            is sometimes a good idea.
            
             
            [Myth] 
            While these are great against Lethar,  I'm not sure they are subtle enough for that.  If I were running an army (even a zombie army), I'd be suspicious if my scouts went over a ridge, there was a big flask of light, and nobody reported back.
            
             Also, I believe that I can make a decent set of mines based on light and life that would be pretty nasty (just hard to
            hide )
             
            [Pook]
            If you do this I think you would need to use some of your order potions to prevent them from going off prematurely.  At army advancement speeds we should have some time between Lethar impact and Horde impact.  If we assume they are moving at 2'/ct [ALEX? - There are zombies in the horde] and there is a 3/4 mi gap (~3900 ft) that gives us about 6.5 minutes to deal with the lethar and set up before the horde crests the hill.  Boy, that is shorter than I expected.
            
             
            [Myth]
            6.5 minutes?  After what we did in the castle in 2.5 seconds?  We'll have time for a fight, a breakfast buffet, some landscaping and a nice in-your-face ritual to meet Pete's Dragon (TM by Disney) and his zombie hordes!
             
            Okay, I exaggerate.  But that is a long time in BT combat.  I might even be able to get in a spell or two.
            
            A Big Question for me is :
             
            Why is this force sortying ? A land force of this composition strikes me as being more useful against 
            some sort of massed troops (Brigade and such) that we haven't really seen. Otherwise I would expect that the 
            high-power baddies would simply head where they needed to be at a fast clip. Do they need these troops as 
            screening forces ? to overwhelm a highpower good guy whose primary skill is in melee ?
             
            I would love to have some idea of what their mission is . It would help use counter them. We might be able to screw 
            the up simply by delaying them. Slagging them is all to the good but it may not be the best move.
             
            [Pook]
             
            Excellant questions.
            
             
            [Myth] 
            I agree.  Excellent questions.  But we may not have the time (despite previous comments) to do good research here, especially through divinatory means.  If the local future here isn't some sort of temporal soup, I'll eat my turban.
             
            While I'm commenting, I think the Ward Nine (I know, Britt, not the real number.  But it sounds cool.) might be a good place to do some of the more delicate setup stuff.  Storm Warden has stated that he can't do that Elemental thing for the whole party in this mana storm, and I'm not sure I could set up the ABS (Abjurational Blasting Shield) easily in one, though it could probably maintain after fairly well.
             
            I would suggest the following distribution:
             
            
            Phase One: Lethar Away
             
            Somehow ambush scouts, and destroy them well and subtly enough so the army doesn't catch on.
             
            Mordanith, Khalid - blasters
            Kilsorana - hampering the opposition by further destabilizing their environment
            Morphus - hoovering up lost souls with his Orb.

            Erithmaeon - damping the output so the army doesn't see
            Rujah - watcher
            Muriel?
             
            
            Phase Two: Get 'Em
             
            Wait for unsuspecting army (back up one ridge to prepared position?) and Let 'Em Have It.

    <visions of Shifter disguised as cleaning crew>  ""Don't mind
us, guys; we're just cleaning up a few things.""

    26 minutes does not sound that outrageous.  Ten minutes to
lure them into place, five for the fight scene, ten minutes up
sweeping up the ashes and planting mines, and retreat to
over-the-hill for the next round.  Tight, but doable.

    Also:

    [Myth]
    Phase One: Lethar Away

    Somehow ambush scouts, and destroy them well and subtly enough
so the army doesn't catch on.

    Mordanith, Khalid - blasters
    >>>Good plan but we want to make sure that blasters don't
blast the physical combatants.  Not a problem, just requires care

    [Myth] Finesse is our middle name.

    Kilsorana - hampering the opposition by further destabilizing
their environment
    >>>Sounds scary
    [Myth] Kilsorana is scary.  But I think we have to play to our
strengths here; let the violent and powerful people be violent and
powerful, let the creative and random people be creative and
random, and let the sneaky and deadly people be sneaky and deadly.

    Morphus - hoovering up lost souls with his Orb.
    >>>That would be really good if we can do it
    [Myth] Agreed.

    Various Fortu - physical combatants
    >>>I think for the purposes of this battle we should count
Muriel as a Fortu if she doesn't mind
    [Myth] I should think she'd be honored.

    Storm Warden - making sure they don't escape
    >>>Really useful if he can do it
    [Myth] Lethar have enough air in their elemental makeup to
leave them vulnerable to Aeromancers.  Given the local
environment, I think we can count on them not planeshifting or
gating out (at least not successfully), which leaves physical
flight.  Air shielding, the odd downdraft, and a lightning bolt or
two should help enormously.  Though given the area to be covered,
and the local spell range, maybe Khalid and Eman should be helping
out here, too.

    Erithmaeon - damping the output so the army doesn't see
    >>>OK, how?
    [Myth] Um, bi-directional folded abjurational shield?
Something along those lines was my original thought, but I think
the area requirements would kill me.  Maybe a weaker version of
the ABS, that takes loose spell-energy from one side, randomizes
it, and throws it out the other side in tiny blobs, simulating the
natural environment of a mana storm.  Or maybe not.  (Would it
count as dishonesty?  Perhaps.)

    Maybe we should just try and keep all our shots low and
inside.  That'll be the hard part-- not killing the Lethar, but
doing it quietly.

    Two questions:

    1.    What does it mean to ""suignt he"" a sorcery (from
question 7 below)?
    [Myth] ""Using the"" sorcery.  Alex is obviously spell-checking
with an anagram generator.

    2.    I assume that if I want to be stealthy during phase one
of the plan I should have someone else hold the sword of Ariock.
    [Myth] That would be my guess.  Unless you got abilities we
don't know about yet.  (Pretty likely, now that I think about it.)

"RE: Shifters:  Last chance for questions pre-run.","I got a couple of spell questions.

1. Sunbane (learned from Mordanith)
2. Abjurational Blasting Shield (developed with Logos)

Since I have never had details on either of these, is there
anything you have determined that you can tell me?

I have no idea what my 'Sunbane' is nowadays, since Mordanith is
not a Wizard any more.  I would suggest that it might be a shaping
of power into light, and then a shaping of that into Usil-infused
anti-Death light.  Doable with my Ritual Design and him to show
the patterns involved.

As to the ABS, I would guess it as a Shield Power/Shape
Power/Blast Power combo.  Complex, but not overly so.

If a spell is stacking multiple sorcery effects, do you have a
rule for the combination?  Do I add mods/times/costs, take the
best/worst, or what?

Why those greedy little...  <ahem> ...those fine examples of
warriorhood, as I was just explaining to my equally-fragile mage
friends.

Sorry for the misunderstanding.


..And now back to calendar hell.

I have removed the BAD dates, since they are not longer in play.
Hopefully, a shorter list will provoke faster response times from
those of us not on vacation.

(Note the futile optimism, a trait I'm trying to cultivate
professionally, since apparently a 'DOOMED' sandwich board
violates my company's dress code.)

All dates approved by Pookie, Chris, Britt, Lara, Myth

Someone (Chris?) had suggested a weeknight run.  Unless it's in
the 12/28 - 12/30 date range (wherein I burn the last of my
vacation days), I think that would probably run too late for my
aging metabolism to cope with, given that work the next day would
not go away.

"Re: Shapeshifters Run","I say we run the 24th if Alex is willing.  I have a feeling that the 31st will not be available for me either and I would like to nail the 24th down before someone else steals it :-)  If it will help Jim we can start a house hunting support group since Britt is actively looking and has found some cool web sites and I am passively looking just to keep an eye on what is out there.

Do we have a 24th or 31st preference?

While I would be willing (and Eman might even be relieved) to run
without Mordanith, t would indeed be a lesser experience.

ps- Just kidding with that 'relieved' thing.  Eman knows that
Mordanith's powerhouse-ness has saved them more than once from the

        Hmmmm,  If its purely a matter of reputation and has nothing to do with the facts of the situation then perhaps I should start a rumor that Erithmaeon is actually the catalyst for all of the chaos that surrounds shapeshifters.  After all, its common knowledge that everyone who has anything remotely to do with the Wizards Council is actually just Loki in disguise.  Furthermore Erethmeaon tends to hang around discpline magic alot and has not managed to blow his brains out yet indicating that he is clearly a preceptor and is just not telling us.  Finally Aerythmayon has a difficult to spell name which makes him an obvious outsider and an easy target for scape goating.  Need I say more?

Jim?

Do we have a 24th or 31st preference?

While I would be willing (and Eman might even be relieved) to run
without Mordanith, t would indeed be a lesser experience.

"RE: Lunch tomorrow to talk about Elven Magic ?","My off the cuff answers without regard to what the GM thinks:

The Elvish Hierarchy is a not that straightforward. The common elven world-view is something like this:

Gray-elves (Air-Light), High-elves (Earth-Light), and Wood-elves (Air-Heads) appear to have 
been designed directly by Correllan as they are now (OK, so some fine-tuning 
has occurrred over time). Sea-elves appear to be the result of a Corellan 
approved/aided change (Water in place of Air)  to Gray elves. The Golden-Ones 
were the result of an unopposed but unsanctioned change to Fire-Earth-Light from Earth-Light
in some High Elves. Green-Elves are the result of interbreedings between Sea-Elves and 
other elven races (mostly high). These occur indecently often (at least 7 times in the last 
3000 years !).

Sorcery is the elvish common denominator. All the elves appear to be strong (instinctive) sorcery 
users. Almost all elves use some sort of sorcery every day. Wood-Elves are the strongest natural 
sorcerers among the elves.

Of the more structured magics, Naming is in common use by the Faer-han and some 70-80% of High-Elves.
With some 20-30% of High-elves using human wizardries.

My basic take is that the early period Golden-Ones saw them using sorceries and naming, and then creating 
some things that we would recognize as human style wizardries. They were very big into resurrecting  the 
previous epoch's technology.

On a side note, I visualize naming as a very broad collection of skills dealing with the relationship of 
visualizations such as words, gestures, and materials to power patterns. A true master namer (of which 
I think only a few exist (= Labelas, Adonai, Sylvanus)  could create a new ""feature"" or ""verb""  in a wizardry
power pattern by verbalizing with power. So to say that a elf is a namer delineates a broad range of 
possibilities. They may specialize in wizardry power patterns, racial mana-genetics, or any of a set
of skills that add/enforce structure on power. 

This to me is one step removed from the Draconic skill of languaging which seems to control the Draconic 
relationship to the environment via the dynamic ateration of the interface from either side. Elves typically only 
control it from environment's side. Ugh, me elf, you are now a new power pattern. Hello power pattern , I am 
a dragon, how would you like to communicate ?

    I was thinking about just this sort of thing (the Kilsorana question) when I was wacking together the wizardry pages.
    
    What I was wondering is, is Naming an elvish thing or is it more of a Gray Elvish thing?
    
    If we consider the Golden Ones to be degenerate High Elves did they use Naming or traditional Wizxardries.  I suspect that latter more although there could have been exceptions.
    
    What about Gulliver?  Is he a wizard or a Namer?  Looks like a wizard to me?
    
    High Elves?  Wood Elves?  Sea Elves?  they all seem a little more integrated into the human model.  Do they all have access to both patterns?  Or is it that they have access to either pattern but couldn't really develop both (Naming and Wizardries)?  As a statistical cross section of the magic using population what % of each race are Namers?
    
    I would suspect in decreasing order of commoness it would be
    High Elf
    Golden One
    Sea Elf
    Wood Elf
    
    But I don't know if the range is 90%-50% or 20%-0%.

        Kilsorana is a funny thing- she is an exception to the rule.  As are
        BTW, many of the sea-elves.    She has the potential for both but she
        primarily uses what the elves call ""Isolated, Bounded Power Patterns"" 
        (aka ""Human Wizardries"").
        She was taught primarily the ""Alteration"" pattern.  She was taught not
        in the classical Elven manner but rather by an Eldar with a slightly
        skewed relationship to the Prime.  (For one thing he doesn't believe in
        the Prime.  He thinks of it as a mass delusion that is the cause of most
        of the suffering in the world.)
        
        I am more inclined to call Elven mages ""Namers""  and isolate the pattern
        more.

       Yes! I am moved!!  Hurrah!  So, the first thing to do when one moves
is to plan a large group of people coming over to force you to finish
unpacking and get the house in shape :>

I hear that Britt is being descended on the weekend of the 24th with
family, so, I would like to volunteer my place for the run on the 24th...

Matt said he would cook!! (and he is a good cook)..

So, are people up for that?  Also, please let me know if I forgot anyone in
this post...I am having the nagging feeling that I am missing someone..

So, let me know what you all think..  It is a child free/cat free zone...

in front of dragonoids.

2. See how Peter did on his Wizard's Guild entrance exam.

3. Arrange for pry-shielding suitable for people in a Krell-run
organization.


Longer Term--

0. Survive

1. Train strongly whenever possible in physical-survival skills
and wizardries.

2. Talk to Sigmund and express his concerns.

3. Pick a third wizardry and master it before age 25.


Longest Term--

0. Learn more wizardries

1. Firmly establish Phoenix Rising Sector

2. Take an apprentice

3. Work at delaying the end of the Era, or lessening the damage it
does.



Your summary agrees with my memories, but I suspect we'll want to
start the run with a summary of what happened before.

The short version (for Lara) -
We were scary, they were scary, we nearly died, we kicked their
butts.

"Re: Shapeshifters","Probably a very poor and Sigmund centric view of what happened.  Also , this
is all from memory so I am not sure how accurate it is (my memory is not as
sturdy as most):

When last you left us we had firmly decided to ambush a large train of
zombies and ghouls which outnumberd us by aproximately1000 to 1.  We had
discovered a point along there path in which they would pass through a large
ravine with small berms spread across.  We were setting up our ambush there.

The aproximate force opposing us was (as best I can remember) about 10,000
zombies & ghouls with a number of Ogres along.  These were lead by a large
number of Necromancers who also had about 20 lethar as forward scouts and a
large invisible dragon as a shock troop.  I forget whether we had
established that some of the Necromantic forces were death lords or not.

As a side note during the entire setup Sigmund was under the impression that
the invisible Dragon which led the troops was 20' from snout to tail.  It
was not until he actually engaged it in hand-to-hand combat that he
discovered that it was 20' from the ground to the top of it's head and about
80' from snout to tail.  At this point it was too late to change my tactics.
Anyway, this is the problem with fighting invisible creatures.

The lethar where leading the troops (as scouts) so Sigmund. Kor'Keth, D'Jan
and Muriel set up an ambush line at the first berm (an earthy rise excellant
for hiding behind).  D'Jan and Muriel where at the extremes of the Ravine
actually part way up the ravine wall.  The remainder of the forces where
either hidden behind the second wall (Kheldar, Mordenaith, Justicar and
Arak) or hidden behind Kilsorana who had cleverly transformed herself into a
rock outcropping.  Khalid and the StormLord had taken to the air and were
brewing up some nasty weather (a slow but dramatic process involving some
very impressive 100 mile diameter cyclical cloud patterns).  D'Jan had been
given a number of SunBane triggers by Mordenaith in an effort to make
somebody besides himself be ""the beacon which draws all of the fire while
the rest of us act"".

Well that was the plan.  What actually happened was that the lethar came
ahead of the troops in a skirmish line and by sheer luck we noticed that the
dragon was not far behind them.  Some of the lethar where also moving along
the near vertical cliff face like nasty slobbering death spiders (insert
Alex's trademark Lethar face and hand gestures here).  In a brilliant
tactical assesment D'Jan determined that even if he hid from them they would
easily see the back troops before we could ax them quietly and the dragon
would surely notice that so it was much more productive to take them out in
a big flashy way.

Becoming visible D'Jan waved his arms and started shouting.  When they were
all straing directly at him he let them have it with both of the SunBane
triggers.  I forget the exact breakdown but he toasted quite a number of
them (though not all) in a very short amount of time.  This is when the
proverbial shit started hitting the fan.

Sigmund (still under the impression that 20' tall meant the dragon was about
triple human size) decided that since our cover was blown it was time to
take the dragon out before he could overrun the mages.  Thus the invisible
3' tall creature started charging towards where he thought the invisible 20'
tall creature was with the intent to do bodily harm.  Meanwhile Arak, seeing
at least one non-toasted lethar charging towards D'Jan began his own charge
to back up his diminuative friend.  At the same time Mordenaith and Kheldar
were both casting there won respective longer term spells.  I apologize
E-Man because I do not remember your actions at this part of the battle
(although how could I forget them later).

Meanwhile Khalid has finally explained to the StormLord that you actually
can have storms without using water, they are called sandstorms.  The
StormLord, being a bit of a traditionalists has a little trouble with this
idea but decides to give it a whirl.

At about this point Sigmund gets close to the dragon and they both start
swinging around looking for each other.  The dragon seems to find Sigmund
first and breathes a huge cone of fire which Sigmund is barely able to
escape by leaping almost 20' vertically into the air (do not try this at
home - do not ask me to repeat that feat).  As he is contemplating what to
do next the dragon takes a swipe with his wing and sends sigmund flying into
the dirt (most painfully I might add).

At roughly the same time both Mordenaith and Kheldars spells go off.
Mordenaith takes a large rock and accelerates it into the Dragon (which had
cleverly revealed itself by breathing on me).  The rock was accelerated so
fast that it approached cannon ball speeds and punched a large hole through
the dragon. Kheldar was taking a less direct approach and had summoned all
of the remaining lethar into a warded summoning circle.  They were ecstatic
about the nearness of tasy humans until they found they could not penetrate
the wards.  This frustration turned to even greater displeasure when Kheldar
pulled out the Orb of Souls and started draining their very existence.  This
small portion of the battle proceded at a much less frantic pace as Kheldar
liesurley dispatched the remaining scouts.

Meanwhile back at the dragon Sigmund was madly healing himself after the
painful impact with the ground which would have made him a very tasty target
had not E-Man intervened.  Erithmaen had been flying towards the battle site
on his trusty carpet and decided, for reasons he will have to explain to do
an acrobatic dismount directly in front of the dragon and allow his carpet
to fly away.  Needless to say this show of bravado distracted the dragon
momentarily.  The dragon decided to breath on the obviously dangerous new
target who escaped by a thin margin with his life.  Using this distraction,
and the fact that the dragons head was turned Sigmund charged forward and
lept onto the dragons back.  This was about the point where I discovered
that I was fighting something the size of my house (that's right 39 westlake
road is about 80' by 30' by 20' at the roof).  Oh well, too late to change
now.  I started to climb the neck.

As we were dealing with the first 15 or so members of the 10,000 creature
army Khalid and the StormLord started at the other end of the column.
Having whipped the winds up to a reasonable velocity they started a huge
wall of flying sand moving down the ravine.  Khalid threw in a few dust
devils to toss about the siege towers and large creatures while the
StormLord began peppering things with lightning bolts from an altitude of
two or three miles up.  A wyvern mounted death lord attempted to ascend to
the heights to see the cause of this unusual weather but did not make it
very far before becoming cajun blackened death lord.  The loss of the rear
gaurd and the large flying objects, 100 mph winds and choking dust did not
have a good impact on moral but unfortunately for them zombies are stupid.
Which I suppose is just as well since the didn't have anywhere to run to
anyway.

Back at the front combat Sigmund was rapidly climbing the dragons neck.  In
order to attempt to combat a creature of this size I enlarged my own size
until I was 12' tall but I was still a blip compared to the dragon.  At the
point I reached the head the dragon decided to slam its head against the
ground squashing me flat.  Having very little time to react I stabbed my
shortsword into the dragons ear, which was about 4' in diameter, returned to
my normal size and crawled inside, converting my sword into its full spear
length in the process.  This did not have a pleasant effect on the dragons
brain.

I apologize once again becuase I know some rather important things were
happening during this period but I am afraid I was a little distratcted.  In
any case at that point the dragons head hit the ground with me now firmly
wedged in its skull.  I took a lot of shaking but was able to keep my
position and burrowed my way in until I carved out enough of the vital stuff
to stop it from moving.  This of course involved the traditional rearing up
to its full height followed by the head falling with a great thud (another
painful process since I was still inside it).  After that we return to my
previous e-mail.  The dust settled on the battle.  I was completely
exhausted and not at my sharpest mentally.  Somehow I had gotten it into my
head that I needed to pull to four fang teeth out of the dragons head as
trophies and, unlike everyone else, I did not notice the approaching mile
high wall of dust until it was upon us.  Everyone else retreated into a
convenient cave (which may have been of your creation).  While the storm,
with Khalid and the StormLord riding it, passed overhead.

The End

"RE: Shapeshifters","A few comments on a very good summary.

(Though focussing more of it on Eman's fantastic contribution
would have improved it massively...)

  ==

>>I forget whether we had established that some of the Necromantic

I think we suspected it, but had not confirmed


>>As a side note during the entire setup Sigmund was under the

Well, -I- feel better about Sigmund's tactical sense now.  Someone
might want to explain it to Eman, though.

>>At the same time Mordenaith and Kheldar were both casting there
won respective longer term spells.  I apologize E-Man because I do
not remember your actions at this part of the battle (although how
could I forget them later).

Apology not needed.  Eman was gathering power and preparing some
air shields and using air elementals as voicemail to talk to
Mordanith and Kheldar.  None of this impacted Sigmund at all.

>>Erithmaen had been flying towards the battle site on his trusty
carpet and decided, for reasons he will have to explain to do an
acrobatic dismount directly in front of the dragon and allow his
carpet to fly away.

Erithmaeon's decision was based on being targeted by a
fire-breathing invisible whatsit, and the ardent desire not to
become a fire mage quite that quickly.  A simple air-based carpet
acceleration would have gotten him out of the way in time.  Good
planing, poor execution.  He got the -carpet- out of the way in
time, but failed to achieve his primary goal.

With a roll as good as the previous was bad, he tumbled gracefully
down the cliff and landed on his feet, having time only to jump
frantically into the air while screaming 'UP!' at all his
elemental friends.  They listened, he was thrown into the air but
not toasted, and he managed to call the carpet back before he fell
back down.

He did, however, become convinced that the concept of a
ground-based air mage was tactically unsound.


>>This was about the point where I discovered that I was fighting
something the size of my house (that's right 39 westlake road is
about 80' by 30' by 20' at the roof).

Your house does not breathe fire and throw people around.
Otherwise, it's a scary comparison.


>>A wyvern mounted death lord attempted to ascend to the heights
to see the cause of this unusual weather but did not make it very
far before becoming cajun blackened death lord.

Khalid used him for lesson practice, and let the Storm Lord finish
him off once it got boring.

A couple of others gave Eman the chance to use a Sunbane spell,
and Muriel the chance to enhance him in the process.  There's a
certain charm in blasting your foes out of the sky with a
dangerous woman at your side.


>>I apologize once again becuase I know some rather important
things were happening during this period but I am afraid I was a
little distratcted.

A few of the necromancers managed to set up a ward around
themselves and one of the siege towers, and thus escape the wrath
of Khalid.  Eman found a loose thread in their ward and pulled it
out, with predictable results.


>>Everyone else retreated into a convenient cave (which may have
been of your creation).

I'm fairly sure Kilsorana Altered the cave.  I'm positive she
added the bathtub.

At some point during the battle, she also convinced a bunch of the
cliffside to become water, discomfiting creeping Lethar and
washing back the first array of zombies.  It was very impressive.


I'm sure other people have remembered different parts, and that
there's stuff I missed.  I will join Jim in cowering behind the
shield of character-centric memories if I have slighted anyone.

                                -Myth/Eman.

I didn't know she could do that, interesting.  I suppose it is not suprising since I can do it as a Drawing mage as well as a Fortu and I suspect this is something Will Workers do as well.  I wonder which variant she used.

  A few comments on a very good summary.

  (Though focussing more of it on Eman's fantastic contribution
  would have improved it massively...)

    ==

  >>I forget whether we had established that some of the Necromantic
  forces were death lords or not.

  I think we suspected it, but had not confirmed


  >>As a side note during the entire setup Sigmund was under the
  impression that the invisible Dragon which led the troops was 20'
  from snout to tail.

  Well, -I- feel better about Sigmund's tactical sense now.  Someone
  might want to explain it to Eman, though.

  >>At the same time Mordenaith and Kheldar were both casting there
  won respective longer term spells.  I apologize E-Man because I do
  not remember your actions at this part of the battle (although how
  could I forget them later).

  Apology not needed.  Eman was gathering power and preparing some
  air shields and using air elementals as voicemail to talk to
  Mordanith and Kheldar.  None of this impacted Sigmund at all.

  >>Erithmaen had been flying towards the battle site on his trusty
  carpet and decided, for reasons he will have to explain to do an
  acrobatic dismount directly in front of the dragon and allow his
  carpet to fly away.

  Erithmaeon's decision was based on being targeted by a
  fire-breathing invisible whatsit, and the ardent desire not to
  become a fire mage quite that quickly.  A simple air-based carpet
  acceleration would have gotten him out of the way in time.  Good
  planing, poor execution.  He got the -carpet- out of the way in
  time, but failed to achieve his primary goal.

  With a roll as good as the previous was bad, he tumbled gracefully
  down the cliff and landed on his feet, having time only to jump
  frantically into the air while screaming 'UP!' at all his
  elemental friends.  They listened, he was thrown into the air but
  not toasted, and he managed to call the carpet back before he fell
  back down.

  He did, however, become convinced that the concept of a
  ground-based air mage was tactically unsound.


  >>This was about the point where I discovered that I was fighting
  something the size of my house (that's right 39 westlake road is
  about 80' by 30' by 20' at the roof).

  Your house does not breathe fire and throw people around.
  Otherwise, it's a scary comparison.


  >>A wyvern mounted death lord attempted to ascend to the heights
  to see the cause of this unusual weather but did not make it very
  far before becoming cajun blackened death lord.

  Khalid used him for lesson practice, and let the Storm Lord finish
  him off once it got boring.

  A couple of others gave Eman the chance to use a Sunbane spell,
  and Muriel the chance to enhance him in the process.  There's a
  certain charm in blasting your foes out of the sky with a
  dangerous woman at your side.


  >>I apologize once again becuase I know some rather important
  things were happening during this period but I am afraid I was a
  little distratcted.

  A few of the necromancers managed to set up a ward around
  themselves and one of the siege towers, and thus escape the wrath
  of Khalid.  Eman found a loose thread in their ward and pulled it
  out, with predictable results.


  >>Everyone else retreated into a convenient cave (which may have
  been of your creation).

  I'm fairly sure Kilsorana Altered the cave.  I'm positive she
  added the bathtub.

  At some point during the battle, she also convinced a bunch of the
  cliffside to become water, discomfiting creeping Lethar and
  washing back the first array of zombies.  It was very impressive.


  I'm sure other people have remembered different parts, and that
  there's stuff I missed.  I will join Jim in cowering behind the
  shield of character-centric memories if I have slighted anyone.

That's different!  (Well, to Eman, anyhow.  I think your points
are fairly valid.)

His major worry is not the risks but the perceived
uncharacteristicness of them.

Eman is also concerned about those things, but doesn't see a way
not to risk them and thinks they'll have to be mastered
eventually.

"Re: Shapeshifters","One very relevant question would be whether, once the dust clears, there will be anything immediate to fight.  It sounded to me like the immediate column of zombies was trashed beyond recognition so that they are not much of a threat.  If this is so I am all for victoriuosly exitting the field having accomplished our objectives.  If however there are creatures remaining then we may not have much of an option.

What are our exit strategies from departing from the midst of a mana storm.  I am perfectly willing to do a ""safe teleport"" if someone can reduce the storm in the local area.  Also we could pattern walk away.  

The next question would be where to next?  At the moment I am a vege brain do to exhaustion overload and probably will be for a day or two.  After that my next priority is to deprogram Gallek (in Marden).  After that I am open to any course of events which will in some way prepare me for offing Rhismaeon or courting Kalarina.

I am willing to work on longer term actions (in which case I will be prepping to off Rhismaeon in the background) up to two-four weeks at which point I will want to do the actual deed.  I would rather not deal with that next run.

I have heard it will be interesting the next time I meet the Master Alterationist of Marden.  I wonder if this is true about the Master Summoner as well.  Come to think of it I wonder if this is true of Kilsorana?

Given that the communication line that Kheldar laid down passes relatively
close by - but not into - the cave where all of you are, your characters
won't be able to discuss options with Kheldar unless someone creates a link
with that communications line.

Until something like that is done Kheldar won't be able to discuss strategy
or what he plans to do next.

Chris can tell you that soon after the last run we had discussed having a
period of time after the battle to rest, recoup, touch base on private
projects and then go off on our next fiasco, er I mean adventure.  

Almost certainly Odin will be spending some time soon after the storm hits
riding the battle area in order to assess the situation, show a presence in
various areas of the battle, reinforce weak areas if necessary - especially
to assist any of the Valkyrie if a group is in over their heads - (either
by combat or bringing in reinforcements), and in general revelling in the
fury of the storm.

After that, Kheldar needs to touch base on some critical projects if not
actually work on them.  I'd like him to have at least a couple days to do
this in, more if possible.

creates a link
with that communications line.

Until something like that is done Kheldar won't be able to discuss
strategy
or what he plans to do next.

Chris can tell you that soon after the last run we had discussed
having a
period of time after the battle to rest, recoup, touch base on
private
projects and then go off on our next fiasco, er I mean adventure.

Almost certainly Odin will be spending some time soon after the
storm hits
riding the battle area in order to assess the situation, show a
presence in
various areas of the battle, reinforce weak areas if necessary -
especially
to assist any of the Valkyrie if a group is in over their heads -
(either
by combat or bringing in reinforcements), and in general revelling
in the
fury of the storm.

After that, Kheldar needs to touch base on some critical projects
if not
actually work on them.  I'd like him to have at least a couple
days to do
this in, more if possible.

"Re: Shapeshifters","THIS IS NOT CHARACTER INFORMATION - I HAVE NOT TOLD OTHER CHARACTERS ABOUT THIS
In two to four weeks I am planning to assassinate Rhismeaon.  I do not have a fixed deadline for this so much as I know that I have to do it real soon or I am going to regret it.  I would prefer to have it planned out, have lots of cool tricks up my sleave and lots of people I can depend on helping out.  Unfortunately for security reasons it is important that I not tell anyone that I want to help me with it until the last minute so there is as small a chance as possible for him to find out.  Furthermore there are certain people I cannot tell because if Kheldar finds out about it he has sworn an oath that would require him to probably tell Rhismaeon (although I do not think that is what his character would like to do).  Essentially Rhismaeon has been actively attempting to reprogram my brain so that I will become a mindless servant of his.  I have found boobytraps laid by him when I have connected to the net (downloads with nasty viruses, etc..).  Also he is currently trying to reprogram the ward and has gotten a lot farther than people suspect.  If I do not do something I may cease to become the cheery free willed enitity you have come to know and love.

The biggest reason for staying is that transportation is extremely
dangerous at the moment (because of the storm).  When we leave will be a
balance between that danger and the danger of the Lich coming after us.

Please keep in mind that the mana storm effectively creates an ""area""
through which we cannot transport safely.  Granted, many of us know that
""geometric space"" is a construct and that ""here"" and ""there"" are irrelevant
at certain levels.  Within this reality, however, it is currently extremely
difficult to see ""there"" from ""here"".  Do I have that right , Alex?

"Nureyev","Just thought I woud ramble randomly about Nureyev for a few moments to let the gray cells unwind a little.

Physical Description
Nureyev is about 6'4"" tall and weighs a good bit over 200 pounds.  What would be typical for a highly muscular person of that hieght?  300#?  He has the build of a professional weightlifter.  Nureyev's skin is a deep black.  Closer to the deep black of Seal (a musician whom I like a lot) rather than the coffee black of alot of the coloured people we see in the entertainment industry.  He also does not have a single hair on his body.  OK I lied, he has eyebrows and nose hairs and things like that but he is bald as an egg.  Actually Nureyev's appearance is not at all unusual for a denizen of the jungles of Venn (I picture him as the classic Nubian).  He is a bit more muscular and massive than most of that region (which tend towards strong and wiry rather than strong and massive) but otherwise would blend in fairly well.  Well, except for the modifications.  

When Nureyev walked out of the Venn jungle into Tharuden this is what he looked like but there has been one minor alteration since then.  Embedded in a pattern resembling a tonsur around the side and back of his head are a number of glowing orange-red crystals.  These crystals average about 1"" to 2"" in length and when unlit have an burnt orangish color and a texture somewhere between quartz and resin.  On a constant basis (even while he is asleep) red and orange sparks can be seen travelling through the crystals and an occasional glow blooms, expands and then faeds away.  It appears as if the crystals are actually attached to his head and some people theorize that they penetrate into his brain.  Nureyev installed these crystals in himself a few hundred years after the Fortu were developed.  Some people say that in addition to looking unusual there have been several personality changes since the crystals were installed.  Then again it is hard to tell since he was not the most traditional person in the first place.

Personality
Nureyev is often seen walking around almost completely naked (small loin cloth and a utility belt) and definately prefers the minimum amount of clothing required.  On the other hand he enjoys jewelry and may often be seen wearing necklaces, arm and ankle braces and head chains in the Tharuden style.  He is also prone to carry gadgets and objects around with him and when he does were more clothing it is usualy in order to have more pockets.  Nureyev has a detached and philosophical manner.  He is renowned for being able to view any situation form an impartial perspective and find the humor in it.  His laugh, and hearty deep belly laugh, was a trademark of his and was renowned around Koreth and the  courts of the world (at least the ones were he was welcome).  Sometimes his air of detachment caused concern and even resentment.  Nureyev was the kind of person who could take intense interest in a small garden or the plight of an individual begger and then shrug off the massacre of a Tolnian century as if it were nothing.  Many times the humor which he found in a situation was not appreciated by those who felt they had a stronger interest in the outcome.

At about the time that he installed the crystals in his head his behavior also seemed a bit more abberant.  Always a bit unusual from the odd perspective render by his study of the Eldar Drawing and Alteration arts he was already known to be prone to seemingly non-sensical statements.  Nueyev was often frequented for advice on various matters arcance but it was considered part of the price of the knowledge that you had to spend a lot of effort tracing the bizarre connections that he made before you felt you understood the answer.  Even from this basis of oddity though the change after the crystals was noticiable.  Nureyev began treating everything in a mechanical and objective manner; People, relationships, emotions.  His previous highly social and amiable style became very efficient and terse.  This was most dramatically seen right after the crystals were installed (probably an adjustment period) and his personality soon returned to a more amiable level (after a few hundered years or so) however he was still always subject to bouts of mechanical behavior and there was the sense that something was always held back in his interactions.

There are rumours that just prior to this period was a point of personal depression in Nureyev's life and that one aspect of the descent into his work was as a means of escape from some tragedy he was unwilling to face.

This IS the opinion of an individual Kua-Toa AND the opinion of the
""left-wing"" Kua-Toa.  There are other schools of philosophy amongst the
Kua-Toa which are more ""right-wing"" - i.e. the consensus reality's the

"Slowly going insane as my system virus scans in between bursts of spec writing","As I rounded the breakwater the waves in the inner sea died down.  It was easier to see the docks now and the port town of Amanhoten rising up on the hillside behind it.  It felt good to swim. Cool water coursing over my naked flesh.  I suppose part of me thought it a little odd.  There were not a lot of opportunites for swimming in the deeper jungles of Venn.  Oh sure, there were plenty of rivers but between the snakes and the alligators and other things most people did not talk about not many of the tribes ever voluntarily learned to swim.  Then again, when I had finally walked out of the North end of the jungle and come to the shore of the inner sea it had seemed the most natural thing in the world to dive in and begin a slow easy crawl west.  There is no point at being suprised any more when I act differently than those around me.  It is why I have wandered.  I never question the draw that pulls me north and east.  

Sometimes I wonder if there ever even was a place that I came from or if I suddenly woke up one day already on my journey approaching my destination.  The tribes that I come across are always polite and friendly in a distant way.  They give me food, let me sleep the night and then wish me well on my way the next day.  The wishing me on my way part always seems to be the most authentic although I cannot complain.  I am given the seat of an honoured warrior at the dinner most times.  I asked the witch doctor of the Umgumbi tribe about it and he said my way was being prepared for me.  When I asked him by whom he merely laughed and said my journey itself was so big it made its own path.

Swimming is very calming.  The rythmic pulse of the sea and my limbs as they move through it.  As I pass some of the fishing and trade boats in the harbour I get a few odd looks.  I am not sure if is the fact that I a good foot taller than most of the people I say or the fact that my skin is as black as night.  More likely it is the fact that I do not see many other swimmers in the harbor.  I come to a gentle sloping ramp leading up to a flattened man made area next to all of the ships.  Everything around here is constrcuted.  Some buildings are huge towering mountains of stone with great columns in front like the one facing the main docks.  Most are small huts of wattle and daub or basic adobe construction huddled around their giant brethern like small children hiding from the wind beneath their parents cape.  I am accosted by a small man with a variety of adornments who has the air of someone used to being listened to.  He carries a totem which he brandishes at me but I see that it is devoid of power.  It would be convenient if I could speak any of the languages which he is chattering at me in but that will have to come with time.  I have no answers for him today so I merely stare and smile.  His chattering subsides and he appears a little nervous.  He summons some obvious warriors from a nearby station.  I do not want to prove anything here.  I notice that my naked dripping form is rather noticible in this crowd of smaller energetic people.  I should find the end of my journey soon.  I smile wider and open my hands to the soldiers showing no weapons, at the same time I bring present a tendancy for everyone to trust and be freindly and a feeling for the call which draws me on.  This seems to do the trick as the warriors consult among themselves and then move to accompany me towards the center of the town.  I walk forward encompassing them in my body language.  The obvious acknowledgement of one warrior to another puts them at ease and we adopt familiar roles though no words have been spoken.

My guides make the journey to the town center quick and uneventful and finally I am presented with the object of my calling.  A tremendous ziggurat like building larger than any other man made construction I have seen in the past months.  For some reason the phrases the past few months and all of my life seem interchangeable, how interesting.  There are warriors at the door to this building as well but they are different.  They are linked to the building and things within it and have a number of active will lines around them.  I walk up to them and bow and then wait.  The buildings warriors confer a little with those from the docks and then a subtle pulse travels across one of the lines into the building. In a few moments a taller man emerges from inside the building with long and flowing colorful robes.  His skin is darker by far than any of the others around though still not as dark as mine.  He greets me in the Aritembi dialect of the northern Venn.  I smile and return the greeting with well wishes.  He asks me my purpose here.  I say, ""I have been following a calling over many days journey.  Down the wide river I have come in a boat, through the Jungles of the central north and all along the coast of the inner sea.  Every moment of my journey I have felt the pull of this building which we now stand before.  I have come to learn and to teach.  Will you welcome me in?"".  He just smiled and said, ""Old Manahotep has said that you would be coming.  He has said that we should give you a room and all that you need to learn your way around.  Once that has done the rest will just follow.  He is ussually that vague but he is also ussually correct.  Come in, let me show you around.  My name is Del-Kalinga.""

"Gaming Thought","You know it occured to me recently that spiders are bugs.

This upcoming mission will represent only the third time that Sigmund has seen a bug in his 10-odd years of gaming.

1.    The StarTrek bugs which fell in though our hole in reality.  My weren't they a pain in the ass.

2.    A bunch of sickly bugs which I ran across while wandering around on Kalarina's lands (it might have been Dora's lands).  I think this may have been an MKP run I was sitting in on.  They were big but they were also near death from some strange decay based fungus and so they really didn't give us much hassle.

3.    Magic resistant large underwater spiders.

Hmmmm, perhaps this may be even more challenging than I had anticipated.

As a possible semi-bug I have always thought that Trolls hand an insect derivation becuase of their six limbd status but that is probably not true since they are very recent on the global scale of things.

BTW:  As a side note, if there are no bugs in Alex's world then where does silk come from?  After all, we have actually interacted with the silk mission.  It must come from somewhere.  Are worms not bugs?  In this world is there a silk plant?  Or are they just the rare exception to the no bug rule?  What about honey?  Has a player character ever eaten honey?  I am willing to bet that plant pollination is dependant on some aspect of elemental nature rather than bugs just like decomposing bodies is elemental decay.

1.    No hurricane cloaks
2.    No plane of neutrality and as far as I can tell the whole concept of planes is missing.  Impact:  No teleports, plane shifts, plane sight and transverse does not work for Fortu.
3.    No net and no big brother.
4.    If we are correct about the late epoch 3ness of our time then no concept of divinity and no later wizardric patterns.  W:Drawing, dreamwalking and sorceries seem to be fine.  I am thinking that this may be the same as trying to use wizardries inside the net in which case if you are rank 10+ in a W: (not a G:) you have enough of the pattern in you to be able to use it.  Thus Kilsorana could use alteration and Mordenaith could use Naming (although with all of the other patterns gone I am not sure what there might be to manipulate).  

On a related note since Khalid is the key to air and fire does that mean that W:Air and W:Fire are present when he is around?  What about the orb of souls, does that manifest the necromantic pattern?

On the divine front I think Odin is strong enough to manifest here and though the Archetypal Fortu is not at the moment he might be once I make a few ep rolls.  Also D'Jan might be able to help focus these things.

"Re: Gaming","If we imagine that the epoch 3-4 transition is a wavefront eminating from some central point then I believe the result of last nights discovery was that we are currently in a epoch 3 locale and either:

a.    The transition wavefront has not been started anywhere or
b.    The transition wavefront has been started somewhere else but has not yet reached the area where we are currently located.

Given the nature of an epoch transition I am not sure that there is a difference operationally.  If the 3-4 wavefront is in existence piercing it to get to an epoch 4 period may be as difficult as getting home.  On the other hand if the wave front is in existance, finding it and using the instability around it may be an excellant slingshot to launch our trip home.

As far as our current locale I believe we determined the local consensus was epoch 3 by the lack of a plane of neutrality.

BTW:  On the subject of getting home I have a number of ideas about how we could get home. It seems to me that getting the power and the propulsion (or more appropriately the stasis since my favorite forward travelling time technique is to go hard and ride the wave slow style) are lesser issues.  The big issue to me is targetting.  Imagining for a second that we could launch forward through time and not be destroyed in any of the intervening cataclysms how do we know when to jump off the speeding subway car.

Am I mixing to many metaphors?

      I would add that we should really find out which reality strata we are in ASAP.

Do you really have all your magic items?  I was actually wondering exactly
how many of them survived the transition.  If the wizardries they are based
on don't exist, will any of our magic item still function?

I'm assuming my power enchancer is OK because it was made by the Kao-tao,
but even that may have a radically different function in this epoch than it
did in ours, after all it has been through numerous reality changes to
become what it is now.  

We might want to ask Alex, what items survived.

"Re: Gaming","As far as magic items, Sigmund has only two:

    His multi-weapon (based on epoch 5 magic but also completely self contained and theoretically recereatable using epoch 3 technology so it should not raise any eyebrows).

    His rod of the planes (I have no idea what the meaning of haalite at this time is nor how the rod is handling the strange attunement of the universe).

In retrospect it would have been REALLY useful to have brought the necklace with madras wizardry patterns in them but I had no way of knowing that and I specifically did not bring it since I wanted to be low profile.  Some of my stuff is adamantium but I assume that was around at this point.

    Oh yeah, I think I have a few net-comm globes as well.  These should actually work.  I forgot, even though there is no big brother the network should still exist at this point.  It may not be as well integrated and may also be a friggin war zone but the Kua-Toa started building it very early.  On the other hand it probably does not extend into the locale we are in since this is still Slaad occupied space.  I am not sure.  Once we get out of here I should try net connecting again.

  Well, 
  Do you really have all your magic items?  I was actually wondering exactly
  how many of them survived the transition.  If the wizardries they are based
  on don't exist, will any of our magic item still function?

  I'm assuming my power enchancer is OK because it was made by the Kao-tao,
  but even that may have a radically different function in this epoch than it
  did in ours, after all it has been through numerous reality changes to
  become what it is now.  

  We might want to ask Alex, what items survived.

Lara       6/7/99   7:42 AM  How did it go yesterday?


Myth       6/7/99   8:50 AM  Um... well...

                                  We left no doubt that we had been
there.

Lara       6/7/99   8:51 AM  Can you elaborate?


Myth       6/7/99   8:52 AM  Kheldar's next robe will have ""Please don't
                                  feed the mage"" on the front.

Lara       6/7/99   8:58 AM  *Chuckle* Did you finish? Are we still
there?
                                  When I last left our hero's we were
deciding
                                  if we were going to enter the blue
dome or
                                  not...  did we find the Lich bit?  Did
we get
                                  a spider?

Myth       6/7/99   9:19 AM  Okay.. Another demon of destruction showed
up.
                                   We tried to Odin-bless the spiders on
the
                                  roof (more order), but it followed us
anyway.
                                  Mordanith blasted it handily. (I still
want to
                                  try that ouroboros channeling spell.)
Glass
                                  spiders investigated, we retreated
inward,
                                  found central arena-type room.  Big
dome,
                                  spiders in rafters, two web-encrusted
towers
                                  (scaffolding-type) and a
discipline-tainted
                                  conjuring portal.  Floor covered with
litter,
                                  dead bodies, no sign of shard.  Lights
at end
                                  of hall go out.  Darkness comes.
Kheldar sees
                                  our death (and soul-destruction) about
60
                                  seconds out.

Lara       6/7/99   9:21 AM  Dont' leave me hanging!!!!

Myth       6/7/99   9:25 AM  Kheldar and I link, start physical search
for
                                  shard.  Mordanith starts working on
our exit
                                  plan.  (The 'improvise' part on our
                                  flowchart.)  Darkness advances, we
retreat.
                                  Various nasties on the floor threaten
                                  oblivious mages, are slain by
mage-companions.
                                   (Thanks, Peter!)  With 23 seconds to
go, we
                                  find shard.  Khalid links to Kheldar,
starts
                                  feeding him power.  Mordanith is
almost done
                                  with the teleport dance. Sigmund
figures out
                                  the conjure-portal is insinuating
influence
                                  into the teleport spell.  Eman TK's an
                                  egg-cluster down from the rafters.
Kheldar
                                  Bolt-of-Damnations the conjure-portal
one
                                  count before the teleport spell
completes.
                                  Effective value is 6000 points.  Alex
boggles.
                                   (Well, we all do.)  Things explode.

Myth       6/7/99   9:32 AM  So.  The Lich's bit is no longer to be
found
                                  in Reality.  Neither are we.  Everyone
thinks
                                  we're dead.  They may be right.

                                  We think we're in the Third Epoch, or
maybe
                                  the fourth.  None of my gods have been
born
                                  yet.  Wizardry doesn't exist.  Humans
have yet
                                  to develop.

                                  It's gonna be a long walk home.

Lara       6/7/99   9:34 AM  ACK!!!  ACK!!!  That is not as bad as it
could
                                  it have been but certainly not as good
as it
                                  could be

Myth       6/7/99   9:36 AM  Well, considering the black cloud was
                                  Nilrenam, I think we did reasonably
well.

                                  I will try for a little more detail on
the
                                  ""improvise an exit"" part of the plan
next
                                  time, though.

Lara       6/7/99   10:08 AM Now it is just a matter of getting back to
the
                                  right time.  that will be an
interesting
                                  challenge

Myth       6/7/99   10:12 AM Chris is having problems with the concept.
He
                                  doesn't like it when we break the Big
Rules.

Lara       6/7/99   10:24 AM What big rules did we break?

Myth       6/7/99   10:38 AM Well, an epoch is a chunk of Reality.  When
an
                                  old one is broken, or changed too
much, it is
                                  closed out, and a new one forms.  Once
they're
                                  closed, they're supposed to be gone
forever..
                                  not even gods can go back into an old
one.

                                  Slaad apparently do not believe in
these
                                  rules.  They were trying to pull
themselves
                                  forward (rather than dying out) ((we
think))
                                  and we broke their trap.

Lara       6/7/99   10:38 AM Ahhh...so they are a little angry at us are
                                  they???



Myth       6/7/99   10:41 AM I don't think the Slaad here have noticed.
                                  ""Form"" is still kind of option here,
so we
                                  think we can walk quietly out and just
leave
                                  them wondering why we chose such weird
bodies.
                                   (Something I've occasionally wondered
                                  myself.)

Lara       6/7/99   10:41 AM But the problem is leaving at
all....correct?

Myth       6/7/99   10:45 AM At the moment, the problem is finding a
nice,
                                  quiet place to work, and then seeing
what our
                                  options might be.  Technically, there
is no
                                  reason people can't move -forward-
through the
                                  epochs.  And we have several
historical things
                                  we can use, if they don't kill us.
There are
                                  some temporally unstable caves, and
one or two
                                  of the gods were around back then, and
Sigmund
                                  apparently used to be here, as someone
else.
                                  We have options.

Lara       6/7/99   10:46 AM That's what I like to hear :>

Myth       6/7/99   10:48 AM Pookie has decided that maybe he can try
and
                                  find some time to play in the next
year after
                                  all...



Lara       6/7/99   10:52 AM What a shocker!

Myth       6/7/99   10:54 AM If nothing else, we have the Lich p.o'd and
                                  scratching his head.

                                  And lots of confused gods.  And an
                                  archaeologist on the field trip of a
lifetime.
                                   And a chance to study pre-Mardra
wizardry.
                                  (Well, proto-Wizardry, but still...)

Myth       6/7/99   10:55 AM ...AND I ep-rolled my second wizardry over
                                  8.0, giving me room to learn another.
Ha!  I
                                  may not only beat Usil's record, I
might beat
                                  it before he's even born!

                                  (Arrogance, thy name is ""Dorian"")

Lara       6/7/99   10:57 AM Go E-man, Go E-man... I hear that I have
you
                                  to thank for grabbing some spider eggs
for
                                  me...  thank you  :>

Myth       6/7/99   11:04 AM Well, there's a good chance they won't
survive
                                  the trip, but it seemed a better bet
than the
                                  random body parts people were grabbing
off the
                                  floor.

                                  Frankly, I think a spider-trip would
be a
                                  piece of cake, if we needed to do it
again.
                                  You, me, a couple of fighters... and a
big
                                  Coatu-suit to scare off the
darkspiders.

                                  I'd like the chance to test a few
                                  anti-demon-of-destruction spells, too,
but I'd
                                  settle for some carefully-powered
power blasts
                                  if we were in a hurry.

Lara       6/7/99   11:05 AM Sounds good to me :>

  Here's the deal:

  For a fair while, I've had problems with Alex's names for the various
  degrees of spell-casting (Workings, Rites, etc).

  Updating Eman's sheet, I was inspired with a possible re-naming.

  To wit:

  Cantrips (barely more than sorceries)
    1 caster, can have components, done in seconds
    ex-- ""Air Lance"", ""Chill Beverage"", ""Dry Clean Outfit""

  Spells (more complex, using one or more sorceries)
    Usually 1 caster, often components, done in minutes
    ex-- ""Rebuild to Pattern"", ""Regenerate Limb"", ""Summon Elemental""

  Workings (using one or more spells)
    1 or more casters, usually ingredients and diagrams, done in hours
    ex-- ""Bind Air Elemental to Weaving"", ""Find Familiar"", ""Spell Trigger""

  Rites (time and power-consuming, more complex)
    Several casters, ingredients and diagrams, takes hours to days
    Timing is often a factor
    ex-- ""Time Hammer"", ""Establish Gate"", ""Summon Vordack""

  Rituals (the big guns, very complex and difficult)
    Multiple casters, ingredients and diagrams, hours to days
    Timing is always a factor; may not work at all without right
  conditions
    ex-- ""Isolation Ward for Heartstone"", ""Return to Epoch Five""



  Does this work for people?  Can someone point out the objectionable
  parts I've overlooked?  Comments, questions, even arguments welcomed.

I have no idea who the fates are but the Keristaen are a group of rogue Kua-Toa who are staying outside of the epoch 5 prime consensus in order to better guide it.

Based on the fact that our mission appears to be move to a safer location and then experiment I was wondering if we could do the moving part in a weeknight run.  That way the experimentiung can be done with subgroups more effectively.  Wat do people think of that?

  Based on conversations that Jim and I had on the way home last night we think that we should do the following:

  1. Attempt to use Drawing to hide our ""packet"" emissions.
  2. Walk out in a tight group directly past an ""toads"" and change our direction if it looks like we will cross paths with one.
  3. Move as far away from ANY entity that we possibly can.
  4. Although we think that Dau Pen would treat us better than Dof Sifrin or Corellan, it is probably best to avoid any entities since their outlook now is radically different from what it will be in the future.  The only possible exceptions to this are likely to be whatever corresponds to the Kerestaen or the Fates in this reality.
  5. When we get to an isolated spot experiment as much as possible (without contacting other entities).  Determine when we are, what the structure of reality is, magical rules, discipline rules.
  6. See if we can come up with a plan to get back
  7. If not, find a place to dig in and prepare to hold our own till the next major reality disruption gives us the chance to try again.

  Britt's comment about magic items is a good point.  Based on the Laws of Bound power in our old reality, I would expect that we would have problems.  We aren't in our old reality, however, and that means that the old Laws aren't necessarily in effect.  I brought 5 Comm Globes with me.  Once I determined that I could shield myself magically I decided to bring them along to be used in a spider trap plan that I had.  We shouldn't count on them, though, until we know what affect they have here.  Will they act as beacons, if they work at all?

  What I really want to do is plan another run date ASAP.   Let's use the leftover dates from the last scheduling round as a starting point.

  June 20th
  June 26th
  June 27th
  All of July EXCEPT July 17,18 (Seminar Leader Weekend) and the 24th (Lara:

    In retrospect it would have been REALLY useful to have brought the necklace with madras wizardry patterns in them but I had no way of knowing that and I specifically did not bring it since I wanted to be low profile.  Some of my stuff is adamantium but I assume that was around at this point.
     
        Oh yeah, I think I have a few net-comm globes as well.  These should actually work.  I forgot, even though there is no big brother the network should still exist at this point.  It may not be as well integrated and may also be a friggin war zone but the Kua-Toa started building it very early.  On the other hand it probably does not extend into the locale we are in since this is still Slaad occupied space.  I am not sure.  Once we get out of here I should try net connecting again.

      Well, 
      Do you really have all your magic items?  I was actually wondering exactly
      how many of them survived the transition.  If the wizardries they are based
      on don't exist, will any of our magic item still function?

      I'm assuming my power enchancer is OK because it was made by the Kao-tao,
      but even that may have a radically different function in this epoch than it
      did in ours, after all it has been through numerous reality changes to
      become what it is now.  

      We might want to ask Alex, what items survived.

    If we imagine that the epoch 3-4 transition is a wavefront eminating from some central point then I believe the result of last nights discovery was that we are currently in a epoch 3 locale and either:

    a.    The transition wavefront has not been started anywhere or
    b.    The transition wavefront has been started somewhere else but has not yet reached the area where we are currently located.

    Given the nature of an epoch transition I am not sure that there is a difference operationally.  If the 3-4 wavefront is in existence piercing it to get to an epoch 4 period may be as difficult as getting home.  On the other hand if the wave front is in existance, finding it and using the instability around it may be an excellant slingshot to launch our trip home.

    As far as our current locale I believe we determined the local consensus was epoch 3 by the lack of a plane of neutrality.

    BTW:  On the subject of getting home I have a number of ideas about how we could get home. It seems to me that getting the power and the propulsion (or more appropriately the stasis since my favorite forward travelling time technique is to go hard and ride the wave slow style) are lesser issues.  The big issue to me is targetting.  Imagining for a second that we could launch forward through time and not be destroyed in any of the intervening cataclysms how do we know when to jump off the speeding subway car.

    Am I mixing to many metaphors?

        First of all, can I say that I am so psyched that our teleport was hijacked by an evil baddy and we have been catapulted into the distant past.

        Having said that I thought it would be worthwhile to list our assets:

        1.    No hurricane cloaks
        2.    No plane of neutrality and as far as I can tell the whole concept of planes is missing.  Impact:  No teleports, plane shifts, plane sight and transverse does not work for Fortu.
        3.    No net and no big brother.
        4.    If we are correct about the late epoch 3ness of our time then no concept of divinity and no later wizardric patterns.  W:Drawing, dreamwalking and sorceries seem to be fine.  I am thinking that this may be the same as trying to use wizardries inside the net in which case if you are rank 10+ in a W: (not a G:) you have enough of the pattern in you to be able to use it.  Thus Kilsorana could use alteration and Mordenaith could use Naming (although with all of the other patterns gone I am not sure what there might be to manipulate).  
         
        On a related note since Khalid is the key to air and fire does that mean that W:Air and W:Fire are present when he is around?  What about the orb of souls, does that manifest the necromantic pattern?

        On the divine front I think Odin is strong enough to manifest here and though the Archetypal Fortu is not at the moment he might be once I make a few ep rolls.  Also D'Jan might be able to help focus these things.

        Unfortunately this all assumes my 10+ assumption is correct which I do not know.
        5.    Whacking people on the head might still be a good idea although I get the feeling it will be less powerful here (since magery is less restricted).
        6.    Since most of us who have disciplines have studied Kua-Toa disciplines they are probably of use here.  Also I have a sneaking suspicion that the kickback percentage is less since the universe is probably less ordered.

        In summary I think for most people we should stick to:
        Sorceries
        Disciplines
        Things you are 10+ in (maybe)

"Gaming","Just thought I would throw in my two cents after Chris's articulate e-mail.

It seems to me that there are two fairly seperate issues:
1.    Coming up with a way that will allow us to leave the third epoch and
arrive in the fifth epoch in a place and manner of our own choosing and
managing the reintegration into reality so that we maintain our sanity.
2.    Convincing the fifth epoch to let us back in.

All of the analysis that Chris presented in his e-mail seems to me to boil
down to one basic principle.

Let us assume that at some point a great discipline casting was invoked
which asserted order on a previously less ordered universe.  This discipline
casting by its existance forms a barrier between the way of looking at
things before the casting and the way of looking at things after the
casting.

Since we grew up (for the most part) in the way of looking at things after
the casting and furthermore since this way of looking at things is a causal
ordered kind of view we tend to think of our epoch as after the third epoch.
This is also consistent with the 'person standing at the end is the winner'
viewpoint which requires us to assume we are latter if we want to believe
that our casting succeeded.

Anyway, the actual temporal ordering is less relevant.  My point is that by
the very fact that the fifth epoch is formed by the continuing support of
this discipline casting it will resist our re-entry.  Specifically the
consensus of the fifth epoch (lets call it consensus-5) must oppose the
existence of any being which claims to be able to handle/perceive/conceive
of the opposed viewpoint (lets call it the alien-view).  The more an entity
advocates or describes the alien-view the more the consensus-5 must oppose
that entity out of self defense.  Any such entity could be treated as a
virus which would slowly eat away at the strength of the discipline casting
and eventually cause holes in it.

One possible viewpoint is that if we were to travel to the epoch-3 and
return with all of our memories and then tell people all about what we had
seen we would be doing the work of the gate in making the Slaad more present
in epoch-5.  Even worse if we were to get something in epoch-3 (like a kick
ass magic item) and bring it back with us we would definately be strengthen
the slaad position and hence weakening the barrier of consensus-5.

I suspect in the face of that consensus-5 would fight back.  BTW:
consensus-5 could be viewed as an abstract representation of the will
momentum from the discipline cast but I think it is also a convenient term
for the set of major players who have a vested interest in keep epoch-5
distinct from its past.

In any case to address this point (#2 in my first list) I see a few options:

1.    The most successful tact may be to not return at all but to prevent us
from having left in the first place.  After all we are in the chaos time, we
should take advantage of it.  It seems to me that the consensus-5 would be
perfectly happy to let us in if we were willing to say the following, ""Well
the Slaad gate almost had us and we wrestled in some sort of NULL space for
a while but in the end we rejected the Slaad destination and were able to
divert our teleport to a new location.""

The mind boggling question is if we do all sorts of things in epoch-3 to
repell ourselves from having come there then what will happen to us after we
never came?  The answer is we won't care because to our selves in epoch-5 it
will never have happened.  Ignore the apparent paradoxes and they will go
away.

This seems to me the strategy the consensus-5 would most prefer.

2.    Next best might be to treat our exit and re-entry as pure
transportationbut to tack on the following explanation, ""The thing that
makes epoch travel hard is not the going there or the coming back but the
integration and re-integration of reality shifts.  When we went to epoch-3
we were never fully integrated and so we could never fully interact with
anyone there.  This was demonstrated by the way we kept our own physical
laws with us.  When we returned we were unable to reconcile the world view
of epoch-3 with that of epoch-5 and so in order to re-integrate we had to
lock this section of our memories under tight mental blocks.""  This strategy
once again insures the consensus-5 that we will not be going around
spreading the virus of epoch-3-speak.  On the other hand it does allow the
possibility (interesting for us - scary for the consensus-5) that we might
be able to drag tidbits out of this locked store at a later date.  This
approach also has precendence since this is how I am saying that
Olactalan-Tlovanu was able to translate forward to become Nureyev in the
current reality.  In the face of this conversation the consensus-5 might
counter-assert that if, after reintegrating,  we ever did open the locks
enough to adopt the alien-view we would automatically be catapulted out of
the reality back into epoch-3 even if nobody else knew about it.

My opinion is that the consensus-5 would buy this with a little grumbling.

3.    A final possibility is that we could find some way in which our group
is so unique that our doing this journey does not in any way set a
precendant for anyone else.  This is kind of a weak argument and I think we
would have to be able to package it very convincingly for the consensus-5 to
buy it but it certainly gives us the most freedom.

Anyway, that is what occured to me.  What do other people think?

As far as my opinion I think 1 or 2 are both workable for me.  I am very
interested in having memories of the past but I think I already have enough
ammunition in place with my sordid past so that I don't need to push it on
this point.  #1 would probably be not only the most likely to succeed in my
eyes but also the biggest mind fuck and that has some perverse attraction as
well.

On a related note I cannot do the 20th.  Sorry.

"Random Junk","Here is my impression of what the world looked like in the first era of the
fifth cycle.  This is a very rough draft and so lots of things are ill
drawn.

The major changes are:
1. The golden empire city is not exploded and the entire sea/crater which
was created is now plains.
2. The dorian plains are no longer plains but a shallow sea which was later
drained by the water rushing into the rhellanian sea.
3. Faerie exists at the top of the map (prior to Correllan having forcibly
seperated it from the prime).
4. Fire Mountain is still Mount Olympus, the tallest mountain on earth.

Other differences I know about but which are not accurately represented:
1. The actual shape of faerie pre-seperation (the current shape was just
included for convenience)
2. Other golden empire cities.  Specifically Salaam and the place where we
just got teleported out of would both be active cities here.  The one we
were just in would be above water as well.
3. Coastline alterations based on a general drop in the water level
4. The accurate set of cities:  I know the following exist,
	The three main Tharuden cities (?, ?, ?)
	The three main other human cities (Tarrol, Koreth, Kestor)
	The three main golden emipre cities (?, ?, ?)
	Some other random elvish cities
	A dwarvish city

"NI:Random Digression","I had an odd character concept/plot twist for a character in Alex's world.
It is based on the following presumption:

Most characters which are related to Death are ussually characterized as
evil (excepting of course current party members/deities of the dead).  It
occured to me that philosophically you could have a religous paladin of
death who was impersonal rather than evil based on the following argument:

There is a certain class of death I will call environmental death (disease,
hunger, hypothermia,...) which is distinct from violent death or other
direct killing by a CGB*.  In general we can say that environmental death is
based on locations and occurs because the dead person was not suitable for
the environment.  One question that comes from this is why should such harsh
environments exist?  In a consensus reality we can conclude that the
statement ""a person dies of thirst in the desert because it is a harsh
environment"" is motivated by the consensus asserting that ""deserts are harsh
environments"" or ""deserts are places were people die"".  Why then would the
consensus want to make locations were people die?  One reason would be crowd
control.  Planar theory says that we generate the physical world around us
to suit our needs.  Perhaps plagues and hunger in overcrowded cities is just
the consensus' way to encourage us to spread out a little.  Perhaps deserts
and arctic tundras are the consensus' way to get us not to spread out to
much.  After all, the prime leads us to believe that each location must have
a location next to it (no one has yet found and edge) therefor the only
thing that prevents us from spreading out infintiley far from each other is
that environments become to harsh and we become over extended.  In other
words we face death.  Environmental death is not an immediate thing.  It
comes on gradually giving us plenty of time to recognize the error of our
ways and move to a more suitable location.

Possesing this attitude a death-paladin would feel more like a shepard than
a homicidal maniac.  In fact this death-paladin might even regret it when
people die.  Sort of along the lines of ""well I gave them a lot of warnings
but they ignored it.  Mores the pity.""

Does anyone have bounds (can't start by, must finish by)?

As far as a rescue,

I have no problem with being rescued but there is the question of how would
Kay know that we needed rescueing.  From a player perspective I would want
to know more about his plan but from a character perspective I would not be
able to ask him until he got here.  I am not willing to jump that far out of
character unless we can come up with a good rationale.  Of course we are the
SWAT team of rationalizers.

One thing to consider in pursuit of this is, did us leaving epoch 5 cause
anything fundamental to cease to exist?  I think Odin and the Fortu racial
essence still both exist in epoch 5 even if two of their manifestations are
gone.  I am not sure if anything funky would happen if two of the five cease
to exist (especially since one of them has been presumed to not exist
before).  After all Keldar goes to unreachable places a lot.  The key to air
and fire just disappeared (or is this the same situation as Odin and the
Fortu Racial essence).  Correllan might get a funny feeling.  Nilrennon
might have an idea of what happened but is it going to tell anyone?  The orb
of souls just disappeared.  Any number of people might have been monitoring
our movements considering what we were up to.

As far as a plan for next run,

1.	I would like to get to a defensible Slaad free location.
2.	I would like to have the characters have a discussion so we can catch up
to all of the player discussions we are having.
3.	We could immediately attempt a return ritual. -or-
4.	We could attempt to contact a key figure to help us in #3.

I am not interested in living here on a permanent basis.
I am not interested in changing the course of history.
I suspect I will get plenty of opportunity to experience epoch 3 in the
process of returning so I feel no special need to adventure a little before
we go back.

If we were to contact somebody to help us the people that come to mind are:
1.	Me (Olactalan Tlovanu)
2.	My Lover (the Slaad spy that Olactalan does not know is a spy - depending
on when we are)
3.	Dof'Sifrin
4.	Correlan
5.	The 'Kua-Toa academy of royal science' or whatever its called.
6.	The 'Elvish academy of royal science' or whatever its called.
7.	Probably not any Slaad (other than Olactalan's lover).
8.	Someone from epoch 5 big enough to help us.

Top ten ways to return to our epoch:
1.	Cast a massive discipline from the third epoch targeted at the fifth
epoch (or would it be targeted at ourselves?) that asserts that we never
actually left, that this is a bubble reality we are in at the moment and
that we could break out of it and return to any other point in the fifth
epoch reality.
2.	Create an indestructable bubble and place ourselves in stasis in it
triggered to only open when the consensus reaches a certain point.  Then let
the world explode and reform around our safe haven.
3.	Start assimilating ourselves into a reality that would not recognize the
barriers between epochs as difficult to cross.

Of these I would rather avoid the third.  Any other opinions?

I cannot volunteer my place this time, as another game is happening
there and then.

Would hosting at your place make things easier or more difficult from
a parenting/husbanding standpoint?

I'd also like to point out how fabulous Britt's place worked out last
time, if he and the beauteous Rita don't mind being volunteered again.

We don't need no steenking rescue!

I am convinced that we can walk home from here, especially if we can
refrain from gathering more evidence about how hard that is.  I am
nervous about the collateral damage of any actions taken by Kay.
There is also the Balance to consider-- do we want the other side able
to send their big guns after missing high-level parties?  (WE may not
be under the Balance right now, but KAY is.  Any actions of ours are
free; his must be paid for.)

Just my opinion.  Alex can probably verify the Balance stuff to our
Balanced people.

Someone else has done this before...hence our little spider friends in the

Oh-Boy,

Here comes the fun.

I am all for being rescued. How the rationale goes is almost immaterial :-)

I despise the ""try and guess the current reality rules"" runs. And especially
where Alex has a great deal invested in making this a _real_ barrier that
should not be crossed in any trivial manner our margin of error can not
be compensated for by a _merely_good_ BS proposal, it has to be perfect.

One *&(^(&$#^% mistake, one wrong person contacted, one wrong will-symbol
identification and we are stuck here, gradually becoming intwined with
this epoch.

Walking home from this is not like walking home from being 600
realities/planes
from the prime. There is an order of magnitude will difference involved.
The difference between shooting a moving tank with rifle and shooting the
moon is an order of magnitude more energy and targeting.

As for the balance issue. Given Kay can discover where we have gone (not
impossible,
merely ugly) and there is no exchange of information to ""un-balanced""
individuals then
his actions need only be judged by their direct impact on the _opposition_.
It is more
likely that Kay will encounter a direct cost to himself for breaking a
reality barrier
that the consensus protects rather than a cost to our immediate conflict.

Alex can you confirm or deny this opinion ?

If Mordanith's underlying pattern is close enough to current epoch elves
(not a good chance at all)
than Correllan will know simply because the Book of Winds (Revision COntrol
Log for Correllan's
Past work including elves) will have a record of my existence in this
reality. Once we are gone,
he would probably think to look. But since the cost of getting us back is to
much it will be
a ""look but don't touch"" problem.

I am vehemently opposed to #4. If you assume that we are the object being
shot
to the moon then consider the number of differing goals each of these
individuals compared to their next epoch counterparts. i think these may
influence their aim.

Also, each utterance they make ties us closer to this epoch.

My specific objections:

> 1.	Me (Olactalan Tlovanu)

We have no idea what your current goals are now ! Would you really want to
trust your-epoch-3-self ?

And if we misgauge the timing and they are not a spy yet ?

Much of what we represent appears to be an abomination to him. No go !

I would like to say yes. He is most powerful entity that maintains a
coherent worldview in both epochs BUT again, we (especially the Humans)
represent a loss in his future AND who knows what spin he may put any
help he gives us.

> 5.	The 'Kua-Toa academy of royal science' or whatever its called.

Objections to 5 = Objections[1] + Objections[3] + Objections[4]

> 6.	The 'Elvish academy of royal science' or whatever its called.

Same as 3.

Jim JM's mechanistic approach:

Two factors, energy and targeting.

Energy is fairly easy to a point. We can probably bring ourselves
(in our current internally shared consensus) rapidly
to an energy level near the top of the sustainable curve of energies
needed for almost all other reality transformations
in this epoch. Bridging the ""Activation Hump"" by sheer
energy alone would probably require us to exceed this with peek
energies of 60-70 times what we can sustain. Somewhat like
lobbing a basketball over the great wall of china from the
bottom of the mountain range. Aiming at this high an energy
is very questionable.

My suggestion is that we take advantage of the ""tunneling"" effect by
going to the highest sustainable energy level and then intensify
our identification with the target epoch as much as possible, as quickly
as possible. In effect taking the basketball (which once belonged to the
Huns on the other side) to the base of the wall and then letting
intensifying the
attraction between the Mongol owner's hands and the basketball. It is more
difficult
but if it works, the chances of going where we want are much better.

We have =already= crossed the barrier.  At least in the 'forbidden'
direction.  All we need to do now is what everyone in the epoch is
expected to do at the big finish; i.e., make it out alive.
(Non-trivial, but doable.)  Everything else is 'simple' time-travel,
and forward at that.

While I'll agree that there a several MAJOR missteps available to us,
any of which could get us killed, assimilated, or returning home to a
massively different Reality, I think most of them can be avoided by
conceptualizing things properly at the start.

We'll need to do that anyway, so that our return isn't rejected by our
own epoch as 'impossible,' and retroactively erased.

This ain't no walk in the park.  Agreed.

But Khalid has a device from this epoch that managed to make it
handily to our epoch.  There's no reason it can't make the trip again.
(There's also no reason it can't get lost with all the -other- power
enhancers that didn't make it, but let's not dwell on that.)

I would posit that our analogous difference is more a matter if a dive
into the pool and going over Angel Falls with no barrel.

This depends on Kay being subtle, something I have not yet seen
evidence of.  (Then again, our own subtlety is not the stuff of
legend.)

I am also not sure of your Balance information.  OTOH, I am working
off intuition and pattern, having carefully not researched the subject
overmuch.  Though I'd like to point out that we have/are information,
as well as several Powers that are currently out of the World.  Kay
would be restoring ODIN, the KEY OF AIR AND FIRE, and a LICH SHARD to
the World, not to mention Mordanith's not-inconsiderable grace and
style.

That is precisely my concern.  -Breaking- a reality barrier.  Unless
they are easily patched, we could wind up with Serious Damage to
Reality As We Know It.

(Not that there's anything wrong with that.)


> Alex can you confirm or deny this opinion ?

Please?




> Pook Said:

I don't think we have the entirety of any particular concept/power
with us, just personifications, access points and the odd high priest.

ODIN is defined as different from Kheldar, so a new one might just
manifest.  Some other Fortu will eventually aspire to godhood. The Key
to Air and Fire is 'lost'; someone might make a new one, or the old
one might be found in some archaeological dig site.  (Unless it, too,
gets rewritten for our current reality.)  The Five are shielded from
reality, so one or two missing should have no effects beyond the
political.  (Though the new Three's actions will undoubtedly effect
Reality here and there.)

Reality will adjust, just like it would have if we'd truly blown up.

1 and 2 are fine by me.  3 should wait a bit, maybe even until we
develop an actual plan.  (Though some of us have limited lifespans.)

4 sounds.. dangerous.  Particularly is we are not in the historical
Epoch 3, but is some easier-to-get-home-from simulation.  (A point of
view I'd like to encourage, btw.)

I am in favor of your general goals, however.  Since I am here for the
first (and maybe last) time, I would like something to bring home with
me.  (We humans love souvenirs.)  But aside from the
postcard/t-shirt/interesting-skill-or-artifact thing, I'm with you on
the goals thing.

That last is indeed a danger.  The more we interact with this place
like we belong here, the harder it will be to leave.

Any information we have about Epoch 3 may or may not be correct.  Even
if it is correct, we not be where (or when) we think we are.

I would support/object to one or more of the personages listed if I
knew them better.  I'm afraid my history gets a little vague about the
times when no humans yet existed.  In general: ""Very dangerous.  You
go first.""  Particularly if they'd be more inclined to
study/interrogate/dissect us than help.



The Road Home:

Without going into Mr. Jackl-Mochel's extended metaphor (mostly
through lack of understanding of its underlying principles), I think
we have two basic options:

1) Survive until we're home.

2) Take a shortcut.


I favor 2, because I think the cumulative potential for disaster is
less.

Of the shortcuts, most of them seem energy-and skill-intensive at
levels we have not yet attained.

And all approaches have to pass the feasibility test once we get
home-- the more improbable it is, the more we'll have to convince
Epoch 5 to let us in.  The best way I've been able to think of around
that is to assert that we weren't really in Epoch 3 at all, but some
bizarre space-time anomaly left over from then.  If someone can come
up with a variant on this that accounts for observed unBalanced
actions, then we're practically home already.  (""You gotta
beLIEVE!"" -Papparappa the Rapper.)


Anyway, that's my take on it.  See you all Sunday.  (At some
as-yet-undetermined time and space.)


                            -Jim.

That is not a problem.  That is an advantage.

1. We determine a Reality that is consistent with our observations and
will let us get home without destroying us or weakening Epoch 5
reality.

2. We enforce that reality on ourselves.

3. We go home.  Epoch 5 does not need to defend its integrity, thus
lets us in.

4. Tell the story, increasing the consensus that we did indeed return
safely and stay away from 'be not's until we can take 'em.


But I don't think you and I are going to reach a consensus of our own
without input from other, more Jackl-y sources.

"Re: Shifters: Next Run","My mind is boggled by the amount of discussion going on.  Rather than trying
to reply to everything I will just make a few points and then leave it at
that.

1.  I am growing more uncomfortable with being rescued.  It has nothing to
do with the balance but with playing in character.  Either Kay should decide
to rescue us on his own (which presumes that he decides we are in need of
rescue) or he shouldn't come.  If we decide to contact him (a reasonably
logical thing to do) that changes everything but otherwise it just seems to
awkward for me.  Personally I am not feeling a terrible concern about being
rescued since I have made this entire voyage once before (not without
massive changes mind you) but I can see how this attitude might not be
shared by others.

2.    I am fine with not contacting anyone here.  I just suggested it to get
it out in the open but I see the dangers in it.

3.    I was completely lost by JimJM's basketball analogy and, while I
understood it better, I don't really buy into the energy arguments either.
I am not saying cross epoch translation is an easy thing but I personally
think it has nothing to do with the amount of energy you use.  There are
some problems that are not solved by energy and I see discipline castings
like this as having everything to do with the statement you make and any
energy you put in is for the secondary effects.  This may have a LOT to do
with our casting styles.  I think at least JimJM and I cast disciplines very
differently.  I have to say that I agree completely with Myth on this.  The
nigh impossible feat is getting from 5 to 3.  Having done that the entire
universe is somewhat behind us going back to 5 in one way or another.  The
big question I see is how do we do it without living 120,000 years and
surfing three major reality shifts.

4.    I am not sure how to resolve this definatively other than GM
intervention but perhaps that is appropriate.  While all of us are
accomplished disciplinarians I think there are at least four camps:  I am
more dreamwalking influenced, Myth and Chris are more standard Kua-Toa,
JimJM is more elvish and Britt is more seat of the pants.  I don;t know
where Kilsorana fits in and the point is I don't think we have the
theoretical basis to argue this out amongst our characters.  I suspect they
would discover the same lack of a definitive answer that we are.
Frighteningly enough I think that that leaves us no choice but to try our
best shot.

(Prepare for a real mind bender): If you really don't want to be guessing at
the rules of reality I will volunteer to be catapulted by myself into the
future so that I can get some help (like Kay) and come back and get the rest
of us. Now that I think about it more however, I would really rather we
propell ourselves back into our correct reality.  The thing that happened
here that was dangerous was that people went back across an epoch barrier.
I think that is a form of an attach on the integrity of the fifth epoch (by
the Slaad) and I would not want to encourage that attack to be reinforced
even to rescue us.  I think this is Sigmund the Paladin of Reality coming
through but I suspect that enough damage has been done to the epoch 5 prime
by the Slaad gate.  I would not want to see the damage increased by other
people following us.

I still suggest we attempt a way to extricate ourselves.  We could use the
key.  Several of us are proficient in casting discipline isolation wards.
We are all strongly tuned to epoch 5.  I have a specific skill in tuning to
the reality pattern currently being generated by the Linking Ward.  We have
the Liches heart which is linked to the Liche.

One of the clues to how this may or may not be possible is probably in my
own head.  One of the things I would like to experiment with in this next
run is exactly what would happen if I unlock my old memories.  Perhaps this
is a vital ingredient to the casting.  Not only do we need to isolate our
reality to retune to epoch 5 but we need to lock away the memories of epoch
3 in order to resynchronize.  Gee, too bad we don't have an enchanter who
would be willing to muck around in our brains.

"Shapeshifters","Just as a strawman here is a proposal for a first attempt ritual for
returning home (courtesy of Ritual Designs 'R Us a wholly owned subsidiary
of Big Ass Power Pushers).

Intention:

The intention of this ritual is to form the first part in a two part plan
for escape.  The first part (this ritual) is to create (affirm) the reality
that the Slaad gate is actually a reality bubble trap that has formed a
pocket reality around us but is still fundamentally attached to the epoch 5
prime (location of capture).  The second part of the plan is to then escape
from the reality pocket back to a slightly safer location on the prime than
the one we left.

Overview:

The ritual is composed of the following steps: preparation, isolation,
purification, consensus, surrender and revelation.  Each of these steps is
as follows:

Preparation - each person should do whatever is necessary to prepare
themselves for their role in the ritual.

Isolation - we build a big fucking reality ward around ourselves isolating
us from all other interactions from the pocket reality (before we have even
started we have to agree that we are not really in the third epoch at all).

Purification - Each person should acknowledge and shed all attachment that
they have to being in the third epoch.  Each person should also enter the
best state of meditation.

Consensus - The group should establish a unified consensus about what
exactly the fifth epoch is and about there commitment to get out of the
illusory pocket reality in which we are now trapped.

Surrender - Each person must voluntarily give up any thoughts that this is
anything other than a reality pocket and any memories which conflict with
that.  This would be a discipline II (at least since it is retoractive) cast
on yourself.  As far as discipline castings go it should be easier on the
scale of discipline IIs since it really is hard to tell the difference
between an illusory pocket reality and the thing it is emulating.  It will
be hard because we are targetting complete low level belief of the principle
without reservation.

Revelation - We drop the isolation ward and begin searching the pocket
reality for a way out.

A few notes about the implementation of these steps:

1.    Assuming it is still working I suspect Khalid would be the best at
maintaining an isolation sphere since for him it is the most fundamental
operation.

2.    Once we are isolated I would like to set up a mini-linking ward
situation as part of the ritual.  Integrating consensi (consensus?
consensa?) appears to be one of the primary functions of a ward and it would
probably help us immensly if we could objectively view the state of our
consensus.  On the flip side I don't think I can just pop into Ward mode.  I
was thinking more of linking up the other two Fortu in a local net, dropping
into strategy mode and holding the consensus visible in the way that I would
in ward mode but at a much simpler level.  This will also be helped by the
fact that we are only integrating a handful of people in this micro-reality.
I would expect to drop the ward functions before dropping the isolation
shield.

3.    If I do adopt a ward-like mode I suspect I will be a more passive
entity and the people who might best be able to leverage my capabilities
would probably be Kheldar (becuase of his experience and ward skills) and
E-man (because of his patterning).

4.    Khilsorana and Mordenaith (I suspect) have a good deal of enchantment
that may be useful as a basis here but I think this is fundamentally a
discipline casting rather than an enchantment.

5.    I suspect if we are to succesful we could actually rewind our
experience to the point of our entry and lose all memory of the ritual
(since why would you need a ritual if you are already in the pocket
reality).  To handle this circumstance I suggest we create a message
explaining that we just tried an escape ritual from the pocket reality and
if it doesn't work it is possible we won't remember it.  This will explain
why we are in an isolation shield.  I would suggest we place this message in
one of the Fortu brains (D'Jan or Peter - not myself) and lock it so that it
survives the ritual.    We can probably set it up autonomously enough so
that it deletes the trace memories of the context in which it was generated
after a certain interval.  That way there will be no trace.  I suggest D'jan
or Peter becuase (a) they are programmable and (b) they probably have the
smallest reality masses of any of us even considering they are Fortu.  I
think it would be a bad thing for Odin or myself (or really any of us) to
lock this memory even though we have the tools becuase its mere existence
would express a reservation on our parts in the rituals outcome.

Theoretically when the ritual is over we will probably not see anything
different from when it started so it really will be a question of whether we
the players are willing to believe we are in a pocket reality or really in
epoch 3.  After all, what really makes us think we aren't in a pocket
reality.  It is a much more reasonable idea.

I have an interesting feeling that the next couple of runs could end up
having the same feel as Total Recall where you can't distinguish between
illusion and reality.

Anyway, its a plan.  I can go to stage two design if we feel like the
fundamental principles are good.

"Rebuilding Sigmund","Well since I am wounded I wanted figure out a few things.  The first is what
it means for a Fortu to have lost have his brain (and what Fortu wounds are
like) and the second is how I am going to be healed.  I wanted to see if
anybody had any interesting ideas for the latter (although I have to admit I
am going to be a little hesitant to try some things since it is my brain).

Of course this whole discussion presupposes that the party survives and
eventually finds my toasty body and also figures out how to get me out of
hard mode (which should all be pretty easy since Kheldar and 2 fortu are
with you).  It also assumes that I can stabilize (instead of disintegrating)
once I am no longer hard which may a more critical thing than the long term
healing.

Just for amusement I was wondering what a wound in a marble person might
look like so I wrote up the following description and ran it by Alex:

Observable damage [

Sigmund has a 1"" by 2"" whole in his left eye which appears to go into his
head.  Upon close examination it can be seen that the damage on the inside
appears to consist of an 18"" deep hole tapering to a point at the end.  The
surface of this hole is cracked and powdery stone (looking on the inside
more like a crushed porrous lattice  than solid marble - very much like
coral).  Crystalline powder can be seen to seep out of many of the holes in
the the inner surface of the wound.  A clear resinous goo also seeps from a
few channels as well as a grey mist with little sparks of lightning in it.
The wound is very cold.  If you were to touch the inside of the wound it
would be sharp (like steel wool or coral) except where it got melted by the
power blast.  Hopefully pretty soon after coming back around the resinous
goo will coat the inside of the wound preventing the gas from escaping any
more.  A slight crack runs from the eye down the left cheek ending at the
top lip (it probably runs an inch into the head along the upper palate).
While the sword is still in the wound cold sparks can be seen to run up and
down it.  There are no other signs of damage.

]

My first thought as to a plan once I am aware again is as follows:

Do some paramedic style stabilizing (time slow?  abjurational reinforcement?
lots of spackle?) -or-
Leave me in hard mode until you can get me to a Fortu lab.

There are three Fortu Lab that I know of:
  1.. The one at the ward that has the evil Rhysmaeon character at it whom I
don't want to be anywhere near.
  2.. A second one that I can't emtion but if someone suggested it would be
fine with me.
  3.. The partially completed one at the adventurers club (my ideal solution
and clearly the closest).
I think I need to be taken to one of these and stabilized more.

The next thing I think I need is a major operation.  I think this would
consist of the following things:
  1.. More in depth stabilization
  2.. A full systems check for other damage
  3.. Somebody growing a new batch of brain crystals
  4.. Slamming the new crystals in my head (or maybe growing them there in
the first place)
  5.. Doing some sort of restorative field so that all of the physical
elements combine together
This would be the extent of first stage healing.

I do not think that the physical eye which was destroyed is necessary for me
to see.  I think my senses are located in other ways.  Alex has not yet
confirmed this.  If the eye is not necessary to see I would rather leave the
wound open during second stage healing so that I have easy access to my
brain.  I may want to plug stuff into it or modify minor things so an easy
access portal would be handy.  We could always close the eye back up before
I do adventuring again.

I think first stage healing should be short (a few days) and would leave me
in a stable condition with greatly reduced physical and power damage (the
remainder of which can heal up at normal speeds over the next few months).
This is the time for second stage healing.

I believe that having half your brain destroyed is probably less of an issue
for Sigmund than for most (becuase of a number of things/not just being a
fortu).  What I think is likely to have happened is that much of Sigmunds
memory, language and certain types of skills are lost or degraded becuase of
the sudden loss of brain.  Becuase he is Sigmund though, I do not think this
loss needs to be a permanent thing.

Phase II healing for me I think will consist of rebuilding a set of memories
and skills that are consistent with who I say that I am.  I am viewing my
memories as just a first level cache for my true soul.  My soul defines my
identity and my memories and skills embody a form in the world that is
consistent with that identity.  I could lose the whole body and still have
an identity (framework) to rebuild it on.  I think of this as sort of a
higher level pattern.  Anyway, I think sigmund can take on something like
this because (a) he is a master dreamwalker/(Fortu Shape) Shifter and (b)
becuase he has access to the linking ward which has been watching him
intimately for a long time and is fairly well set up for doing this sort of
thing.  I think language skills will be the easiest things to restore (hell
at least one of my languages was just downloaded in the first place).  I
think the hardest things to restore will be any specific memories of things
that I did when I was in a place the ward did not go (the Abyss, Epoch III,
the Sea Elven City, Fire Mountain).  Hopefully I did not lose many of those
memories.  I suspect that do to the holographic nature of the brain if you
wipe out ~50% of the brain you lose ~15% of your memories and the remaining
85% just degrade in clarity.

I am suspecting that phase II healing will take about two months and that I
would want to take it easy during that time.

I have run all of this by Alex and he did not balk but is thinking about it
(no commitment yet).

Anybody got any better ideas?  Things to add? Comments?

I am opposed to the idea of doing a healing ritual that just says something
generic like ""you get better"" or ""you restore to pattern"" when the damage is
brain related.  Does that seem unjustified?  I just feel that a natural
healing process (isn't it scary that I consider the thing I just described
as a natural healing process) is safer.

2. Eman's thoughts on the matter (assuming he makes it through the
current encounter in any condition to -have- thoughts) would run along
these lines:

    A. Leave him hard until we get him someplace good for fixing
Fortu.
    B. Ask those Fortu with us for suggestions on where such a place
might be.
    C. Ask D'Jan (sp?) if there's anything theological (or
theo-illogical) he can be doing to help.
    D. Get a nice, thorough Read Pattern of the damage.  Compare with
an unwounded Fortu of similar type.
    E. Release the Hard.  Update the Read Pattern.  Apply physical
stabilizers.
    F. Use Alteration and Shaping to restore proper Pattern to the
wounded area.
       (Note!  Use as framework only, something for the rest to regrow
unto.)

3. Other resources to consider:

    A. We have a Namer in the group.
    B. One of us, at one time, helped create Sigmund.
    C. Khalid's Power Enhancer (tm) might be useful at some stage or
another.
    D. Kilsoranna and Eman were in the One with Sigmund.  This might
help in repairs.
    E. Peter is a Patterner, too.

  Subject: Rebuilding Sigmund


  Well since I am wounded I wanted figure out a few things.  The first is
what it means for a Fortu to have lost have his brain (and what Fortu wounds
are like) and the second is how I am going to be healed.  I wanted to see if
anybody had any interesting ideas for the latter (although I have to admit I
am going to be a little hesitant to try some things since it is my brain).

  Of course this whole discussion presupposes that the party survives and
eventually finds my toasty body and also figures out how to get me out of
hard mode (which should all be pretty easy since Kheldar and 2 fortu are
with you).  It also assumes that I can stabilize (instead of disintegrating)
once I am no longer hard which may a more critical thing than the long term
healing.

  Just for amusement I was wondering what a wound in a marble person might
look like so I wrote up the following description and ran it by Alex:

  Observable damage [

  Sigmund has a 1"" by 2"" whole in his left eye which appears to go into his
head.  Upon close examination it can be seen that the damage on the inside
appears to consist of an 18"" deep hole tapering to a point at the end.  The
surface of this hole is cracked and powdery stone (looking on the inside
more like a crushed porrous lattice  than solid marble - very much like
coral).  Crystalline powder can be seen to seep out of many of the holes in
the the inner surface of the wound.  A clear resinous goo also seeps from a
few channels as well as a grey mist with little sparks of lightning in it.
The wound is very cold.  If you were to touch the inside of the wound it
would be sharp (like steel wool or coral) except where it got melted by the
power blast.  Hopefully pretty soon after coming back around the resinous
goo will coat the inside of the wound preventing the gas from escaping any
more.  A slight crack runs from the eye down the left cheek ending at the
top lip (it probably runs an inch into the head along the upper palate).
While the sword is still in the wound cold sparks can be seen to run up and
down it.  There are no other signs of damage.

  ]

  My first thought as to a plan once I am aware again is as follows:

  Do some paramedic style stabilizing (time slow?  abjurational
reinforcement?  lots of spackle?) -or-
  Leave me in hard mode until you can get me to a Fortu lab.

  There are three Fortu Lab that I know of:
    1.. The one at the ward that has the evil Rhysmaeon character at it whom
I don't want to be anywhere near.
    2.. A second one that I can't emtion but if someone suggested it would
be fine with me.
    3.. The partially completed one at the adventurers club (my ideal
solution and clearly the closest).
  I think I need to be taken to one of these and stabilized more.

  The next thing I think I need is a major operation.  I think this would
consist of the following things:
    1.. More in depth stabilization
    2.. A full systems check for other damage
    3.. Somebody growing a new batch of brain crystals
    4.. Slamming the new crystals in my head (or maybe growing them there in
the first place)
    5.. Doing some sort of restorative field so that all of the physical
elements combine together
  This would be the extent of first stage healing.

  I do not think that the physical eye which was destroyed is necessary for
me to see.  I think my senses are located in other ways.  Alex has not yet
confirmed this.  If the eye is not necessary to see I would rather leave the
wound open during second stage healing so that I have easy access to my
brain.  I may want to plug stuff into it or modify minor things so an easy
access portal would be handy.  We could always close the eye back up before
I do adventuring again.

  I think first stage healing should be short (a few days) and would leave
me in a stable condition with greatly reduced physical and power damage (the
remainder of which can heal up at normal speeds over the next few months).
This is the time for second stage healing.

  I believe that having half your brain destroyed is probably less of an
issue for Sigmund than for most (becuase of a number of things/not just
being a fortu).  What I think is likely to have happened is that much of
Sigmunds memory, language and certain types of skills are lost or degraded
becuase of the sudden loss of brain.  Becuase he is Sigmund though, I do not
think this loss needs to be a permanent thing.

  Phase II healing for me I think will consist of rebuilding a set of
memories and skills that are consistent with who I say that I am.  I am
viewing my memories as just a first level cache for my true soul.  My soul
defines my identity and my memories and skills embody a form in the world
that is consistent with that identity.  I could lose the whole body and
still have an identity (framework) to rebuild it on.  I think of this as
sort of a higher level pattern.  Anyway, I think sigmund can take on
something like this because (a) he is a master dreamwalker/(Fortu Shape)
Shifter and (b) becuase he has access to the linking ward which has been
watching him intimately for a long time and is fairly well set up for doing
this sort of thing.  I think language skills will be the easiest things to
restore (hell at least one of my languages was just downloaded in the first
place).  I think the hardest things to restore will be any specific memories
of things that I did when I was in a place the ward did not go (the Abyss,
Epoch III, the Sea Elven City, Fire Mountain).  Hopefully I did not lose
many of those memories.  I suspect that do to the holographic nature of the
brain if you wipe out ~50% of the brain you lose ~15% of your memories and
the remaining 85% just degrade in clarity.

  I am suspecting that phase II healing will take about two months and that
I would want to take it easy during that time.

  I have run all of this by Alex and he did not balk but is thinking about
it (no commitment yet).

  Anybody got any better ideas?  Things to add? Comments?

  I am opposed to the idea of doing a healing ritual that just says
something generic like ""you get better"" or ""you restore to pattern"" when the
damage is brain related.  Does that seem unjustified?  I just feel that a
natural healing process (isn't it scary that I consider the thing I just
described as a natural healing process) is safer.

    Well since I am wounded I wanted figure out a few things.  The first is
what it means for a Fortu to have lost have his brain (and what Fortu wounds
are like) and the second is how I am going to be healed.  I wanted to see if
anybody had any interesting ideas for the latter (although I have to admit I
am going to be a little hesitant to try some things since it is my brain).

    Of course this whole discussion presupposes that the party survives and
eventually finds my toasty body and also figures out how to get me out of
hard mode (which should all be pretty easy since Kheldar and 2 fortu are
with you).  It also assumes that I can stabilize (instead of disintegrating)
once I am no longer hard which may a more critical thing than the long term
healing.

    Just for amusement I was wondering what a wound in a marble person might
look like so I wrote up the following description and ran it by Alex:

    Observable damage [

    Sigmund has a 1"" by 2"" whole in his left eye which appears to go into
his head.  Upon close examination it can be seen that the damage on the
inside appears to consist of an 18"" deep hole tapering to a point at the
end.  The surface of this hole is cracked and powdery stone (looking on the
inside more like a crushed porrous lattice  than solid marble - very much
like coral).  Crystalline powder can be seen to seep out of many of the
holes in the the inner surface of the wound.  A clear resinous goo also
seeps from a few channels as well as a grey mist with little sparks of
lightning in it.  The wound is very cold.  If you were to touch the inside
of the wound it would be sharp (like steel wool or coral) except where it
got melted by the power blast.  Hopefully pretty soon after coming back
around the resinous goo will coat the inside of the wound preventing the gas
from escaping any more.  A slight crack runs from the eye down the left
cheek ending at the top lip (it probably runs an inch into the head along
the upper palate).  While the sword is still in the wound cold sparks can be
seen to run up and down it.  There are no other signs of damage.

    ]

    My first thought as to a plan once I am aware again is as follows:

    Do some paramedic style stabilizing (time slow?  abjurational
reinforcement?  lots of spackle?) -or-
    Leave me in hard mode until you can get me to a Fortu lab.

    There are three Fortu Lab that I know of:
      1.. The one at the ward that has the evil Rhysmaeon character at it
whom I don't want to be anywhere near.
      2.. A second one that I can't emtion but if someone suggested it would
be fine with me.
      3.. The partially completed one at the adventurers club (my ideal
solution and clearly the closest).
    I think I need to be taken to one of these and stabilized more.

    The next thing I think I need is a major operation.  I think this would
consist of the following things:
      1.. More in depth stabilization
      2.. A full systems check for other damage
      3.. Somebody growing a new batch of brain crystals
      4.. Slamming the new crystals in my head (or maybe growing them there
in the first place)
      5.. Doing some sort of restorative field so that all of the physical
elements combine together
    This would be the extent of first stage healing.

    I do not think that the physical eye which was destroyed is necessary
for me to see.  I think my senses are located in other ways.  Alex has not
yet confirmed this.  If the eye is not necessary to see I would rather leave
the wound open during second stage healing so that I have easy access to my
brain.  I may want to plug stuff into it or modify minor things so an easy
access portal would be handy.  We could always close the eye back up before
I do adventuring again.

    I think first stage healing should be short (a few days) and would leave
me in a stable condition with greatly reduced physical and power damage (the
remainder of which can heal up at normal speeds over the next few months).
This is the time for second stage healing.

    I believe that having half your brain destroyed is probably less of an
issue for Sigmund than for most (becuase of a number of things/not just
being a fortu).  What I think is likely to have happened is that much of
Sigmunds memory, language and certain types of skills are lost or degraded
becuase of the sudden loss of brain.  Becuase he is Sigmund though, I do not
think this loss needs to be a permanent thing.

    Phase II healing for me I think will consist of rebuilding a set of
memories and skills that are consistent with who I say that I am.  I am
viewing my memories as just a first level cache for my true soul.  My soul
defines my identity and my memories and skills embody a form in the world
that is consistent with that identity.  I could lose the whole body and
still have an identity (framework) to rebuild it on.  I think of this as
sort of a higher level pattern.  Anyway, I think sigmund can take on
something like this because (a) he is a master dreamwalker/(Fortu Shape)
Shifter and (b) becuase he has access to the linking ward which has been
watching him intimately for a long time and is fairly well set up for doing
this sort of thing.  I think language skills will be the easiest things to
restore (hell at least one of my languages was just downloaded in the first
place).  I think the hardest things to restore will be any specific memories
of things that I did when I was in a place the ward did not go (the Abyss,
Epoch III, the Sea Elven City, Fire Mountain).  Hopefully I did not lose
many of those memories.  I suspect that do to the holographic nature of the
brain if you wipe out ~50% of the brain you lose ~15% of your memories and
the remaining 85% just degrade in clarity.

    I am suspecting that phase II healing will take about two months and
that I would want to take it easy during that time.

    I have run all of this by Alex and he did not balk but is thinking about
it (no commitment yet).

    Anybody got any better ideas?  Things to add? Comments?

    I am opposed to the idea of doing a healing ritual that just says
something generic like ""you get better"" or ""you restore to pattern"" when the
damage is brain related.  Does that seem unjustified?  I just feel that a
natural healing process (isn't it scary that I consider the thing I just
described as a natural healing process) is safer.

"RE: Rebuilding Sigmund","Re: Rebuilding SigmundExcellant discussion.  Just a few quick thoughts:

1.    I have no idea what you mean by ""infected by a virus"".  What are you
referring to here?  This sounds important.

2.    I'm glad somebody caught the 18"" hole thing.  I was just trying to
make Fortu a little more non-euclidean by having the space on the inside
larger than the space on the outside.

3.    I agree with your analysis of how Fortu design would have evolved
completely.  The only thing that makes me hesitant is from the completely
player perspective it doesn't seem to make a good story.  On the one hand if
Sigmund's intelligence is to distributed it makes him a little bit comic
book in the way he just bounces back from everything.  On the other hand if
a head shot knocks out his brain that is pretty anthropomorphic which does
not lead to much character differentiation.  That is why I had Sigmund
regenerating his memories and skills from an ""outside of this relaity"" part
of his ""body"".  I am not sure what the answer is here but I will think about
it more.

4.    I don;t think we need any more programmers (other than you) becuase I
don;t think there is anything to program other than a few firmware
connections and diagnostic tests.  I think for the most part this is a
hardware fix.

I pretty much agree with your 1.-4. points.

  OK, here is my input on the situation.  Chris has given Fortu construction
a good amount of thought, but because the Fortu are more related to Pookie's
character than mine, nothing that I say as ""Kheldar"" should be taken as
gospel, (or maybe what Kheldar says is the way Fortu were constructed before
the Fortu Reality Shift).  What I can say is that I've done several things
with Alex that have given Kheldar ranks in Fortu
design/construction/analysis/repair.  That should absolutely add plusses to
Sigmund's healing.


  Let me describe Kheldar's concept of Fortu construction, particularly
Sigmund's construction.


  Only the earliest Fortu models would have been constructed on an
Anthropomorphic basis.  Certainly by Series 3 we would have discarded the
placement of components based on where those control centers would have been
in an evolved biological organism.  The ""mammary"" modules on the female
units are a perfect example of this.  In most cases the ""mammary""
protrusions on a ""female"" Fortu were memory storage.


  By Series 5 we would have gone to a distributed architecture, something
similar to RAID 5 storage (Hot swap and multiple parity drives), all
critical components located in the densest part of the Fortu - the main body
cavity.  The Series 5 Ops model was also designed to manipulate Reality
magics.  As such it would have needed to be designed to be resistant to
external Reality changes yet be able to use Reality magics to effect
repairs.  What good would Wizardry or Sorcery based repairs be in a
""Reality"" where there were no patterns or no mana?


  I liken Serreth's design to that of a Borg starship but not quite a T1000
Terminator.  Borg ships aren't as flexible as T1000's but they are highly
resilient.  Serreth was a Will based entity with material aspects.  He was
designed with the ability to re-configure his firmware.  His head, arms, and
legs were as much Hard Drives in a RAID 5 array as they were ""arms"" or
""legs"" or Audio/Video mounts.  His primary systems would have had multiple
control paths - Fortu have no Aorta.  His peripherals were designed to be
replaced.  Frankly, Serreth should have been able to have his head blown
clean off and not lose any memories/data.


  Would he have been unaffected by this attack?  No.  However:


  1). Depending on what percentage of Sigmund was considered ""parity"", he
would be vulnerable to data loss after losing of 20 to 50% of his body mass.
At that point there would be complete loss of data.  Given that backups to
the Ward over the net were part of the design of the Fortu, significant data
loss, even in the face of complete obliteration of form, would have been
highly unlikely (unless, of course, you refused to do backups and
disconnected yourself from the net but no Wizard would instruct his Fortu to
do that).


  2). Any Fortu feature defined as ""peripheral"" or ""firmware"" which had
components physically located on the damaged area would require repair or
replacement.  ""Firmware"" *might* require physical replacement and
programming.  The Series 5 model would probably be on-line faster with
physical repairs, but would ultimately recreate itself to the point
immediately before damage occurred.  Some functions might be temporarily
off-line until replacement.  (can't speed up or can't transverse).


  3).  Since the architecture is distributed, there would be processor
degradation.  The physical effect would be the minuses given to people who
are more than 100% wounded.  Some functions might be temporarily off-line.
(can't speed up or can only double speed instead of quadruple speed; slower;
less endurance).


  4). System Shock would need to be rolled, but would probably not kill the
Fortu if it was failed unless it was a major failure.  It would, however,
cause the Fortu to go Hard while effecting repairs.  A major failure of
system shock would indicate disruption of primary services AND self repair.
(now the separation of soul would also be an issue)


  The biggest issue from Kheldar's standpoint would not be the physical
damage.  Kheldar would (and does) say that he can have Sigmund's physical
form repaired back to ""normal"" within several hours once he gets Sigmund
into the ""shop"".  Kheldar will be far more concerned, however, with the
corruption of data resulting from the possession.  To continue with the
computer analogy, Sigmund has a virus.  And Kheldar as he is now is not the
best programmer in this reality.


  Since I don't think that Sigmund wants Kheldar to bring Rismaeon in for a
consultation, that leaves Falstaff, Ignatious, Logos, possibly Miriel ...and
the two best options, each of which has a major drawback:
  Big Brother, who knows Sigmund better than any other entity OR
  Arioch, whose programming skills are considerable and whose ability to
follow a logic tree is unmatched.


  I think that further discussion is pointless until Kheldar actually has a
chance to examine Sigmund.  I would like to hear Alex's (and Pookie's)
thoughts on the ""effects of damage"" that I listed above.

  PS.  How can you have an 18"" deep hole going through your head at the eye
if your head is the size of Nicky's head?

    Well since I am wounded I wanted figure out a few things.  The first is
what it means for a Fortu to have lost have his brain (and what Fortu wounds
are like) and the second is how I am going to be healed.  I wanted to see if
anybody had any interesting ideas for the latter (although I have to admit I
am going to be a little hesitant to try some things since it is my brain).

    Of course this whole discussion presupposes that the party survives and
eventually finds my toasty body and also figures out how to get me out of
hard mode (which should all be pretty easy since Kheldar and 2 fortu are
with you).  It also assumes that I can stabilize (instead of disintegrating)
once I am no longer hard which may a more critical thing than the long term
healing.

    Just for amusement I was wondering what a wound in a marble person might
look like so I wrote up the following description and ran it by Alex:

    Observable damage

    [Sigmund has a 1"" by 2"" whole in his left eye which appears to go into
his head.  Upon close examination it can be seen that the damage on the
inside appears to consist of an 18"" deep hole tapering to a point at the
end.  The surface of this hole is cracked and powdery stone (looking on the
inside more like a crushed porrous lattice  than solid marble - very much
like coral).  Crystalline powder can be seen to seep out of many of the
holes in the the inner surface of the wound.  A clear resinous goo also
seeps from a few channels as well as a grey mist with little sparks of
lightning in it.  The wound is very cold.  If you were to touch the inside
of the wound it would be sharp (like steel wool or coral) except where it
got melted by the power blast.  Hopefully pretty soon after coming back
around the resinous goo will coat the inside of the wound preventing the gas
from escaping any more.  A slight crack runs from the eye down the left
cheek ending at the top lip (it probably runs an inch into the head along
the upper palate).  While the sword is still in the wound cold sparks can be
seen to run up and down it.  There are no other signs of damage.]

    My first thought as to a plan once I am aware again is as follows:

    Do some paramedic style stabilizing (time slow?  abjurational
reinforcement?  lots of spackle?) -or-
    Leave me in hard mode until you can get me to a Fortu lab.

    There are three Fortu Lab that I know of:

         1.The one at the ward that has the evil Rhysmaeon character at it
whom I don't want to be anywhere near.
         2.A second one that I can't emtion but if someone suggested it
would be fine with me.
         3.The partially completed one at the adventurers club (my ideal
solution and clearly the closest).

    I think I need to be taken to one of these and stabilized more.

  This is certainly true.  I am assuming that if we were to put a bunch of
the appropriate raw materials in the right place for the repair system that
it would speed up the healing process alot.  I am also assuming that the
closer the materials are to there final form (up to a certain point) the
easier it will be for the repair system to use them.

On the anatomy side, it might make sense to have the CPU near the
sensors, as opposed to elsewhere in the structure.  The design might
even allow for the head to be used as a portable device (PC card?),
though I'd expect it would need to be remounted before it could be
used.  Decentralized processing is probably not wise when you are
building a combat machine-- losing a hand would be bad enough, without
getting more stupid in the process.


Me, I'd put the core processor in the central body, with some
co-processor stuff in the head, and leave limbs for sensors and
effectuators.  Damage considerations (other than the dimensional
co-processor) would be that this happened to systems that were
direct-wired into the brain, rather than the brain itself getting
punctured.


Just my thoughts on the matter.

connection from the reality bubble could service all of the sensors and
motors but at the same time any particular network could be dropped out if
an infection was encountered (wildfire virus, chaos stream, meme attack...).
Finally I would put portculis fuses on the reality bubble interface so that
if a massive chaos stream took over the entire body I could drop the whole
thing to prevent core systems damage.  In order to prevent loss of the
isolated sphere I would tether it to a central point using a completely
non-planar connection.  This tether could also be used as a private
communication channel with other entities hooked in the same way if needed.

Come to think of it when I ""dropped"" the body I might as well just convert
it into a completely non-reactive state.  This way, if it manages to
survive, I could locate it using the backdoor tether to connect to some
reality monitor (like a linking ward) and use that to reattach the physical
body back to the reality bubble.

Kind of scary actually.

Why not make the brain core into separate modules, make then undetectable,
and then hide them all over the world?  That way you can turn yourself into
the lich!

Let's be real here!  You're taking magic technology a little bit to far.  I
know it's fantasy, but it shouldn't be corrupted into Sci-fi tech, where
nothing is impossible.  Manipulating reality on a base level is gross
enough, if you start using reality manipulations as a screwdriver, there are
no bounds left to the game.

Actually, I suppose if I were really building a combat machine I would put
the brain in a reality bubble with only well insulated nerve endings
travelling out into the physical body.  Furthermore I would build the
nervous system as a series of parallel packet networks so that any one
connection from the reality bubble could service all of the sensors and
motors but at the same time any particular network could be dropped out if
an infection was encountered (wildfire virus, chaos stream, meme attack...).

"RE: Rebuilding Sigmund","This was exectly my concern with getting a little to comic book (my term for
black and white morality and heroes that fight the bad guys 20 hours
straight without resting, going to the bathroom or complaining about being
hungry).  Sigmund is prone to this becuase the major metaphor used for most
of his construction (as well as the Net and the Linking Ward) has been
ultra-high-tech.

At the same time, did I just hear you say that our fantasy campaign is
getting a little unrealistic?  I think perhaps the primary issue is story
balance and then given that it may be appropriate to use reality
manipulations as a screwdriver when it comes to Fortu and the net.

As far as story balance I think that getting wacked by a called short in
close combat with a doppleganger who is using a kata that you have spent
years perfecting should probably set you back a few notches.  Based on the
fact that Fortu are very non-human this could show up in a number of ways
but it ought to show up somehow.  That is why I am still thinking it will
take a couple of days to restore Sigmunds ""physical basis"" and a couple of
months to restore his ""mental integrity"".  Whatever that means.

Given that level of balance I would prefer to make the form of sigmunds
physical healing and ""mental integrity loss"" as strange as possible to
emphasize his non-human nature.  I am continuously looking for good non-tech
metaphors however and perhaps I should work on some now becuase I do not
want Sigmund to get too techy or we lose the flavor of the campaign.

could shove an entire elf through the eye socket into my brain cavity I
would be up and on my feet in no time.  Of course the concept of a flighty
Fortu is kind of scary if you ask me.

  I don't know.  I'm a little concerned about that myself.  It depends on
how closely a doppleganger can match patterns and HOW it matches patterns.
Remember that Paladin of Kisereth that was masquerading as a paladin of
Heimdal (or something like that).  Its disguise was based on a reality wall.
It might never have been detected if not for Mordanith searching for an item
that it had in its possession.  What if the doppleganger's abilities work
via reality magic?

If it's any consolation, she got to blow a hole in herself moments
later.  I guess doppelgangers are useful for relieving those unspoken
aggressions.  (Though who would have thought Kilsorana to have an
aggressive thought that wasn't well and truly expressed?)


And I think we triggered hard mode on you if you weren't already, so
I'm not sure how much sparking you're up to.


Quick results of the run are:

Sigmund still terribly, terribly hurt.

Peter mega-exhausted, recovering slowly in hard mode.

Eman not dead yet.  Recovering thanks to the wonders of plot-driven
alchemy and overpowered healer/alterationist.  Out one boon.

Kilsorana impressed by how nasty she can be in a fight.  Gets to see
what the gods do with things they don't like.

Khalid actually complimented by the Sandwalker.  Somehow avoids dying
of shock.  Also finding the joy of traveling with ridiculously
high-powered mages, begins to get cocky.  We'll make a Dorian of him
yet.

Mordanith is high-flying, serene.  	Supports Khalid in flying circus.
Makes a Pokemon, parries a Bolt of Damnation.  Blows up a bit of Fire
Mountain as an afterthought.

Odin fights Death-Lords and Nazghul.  The Orb of Souls is well-fed.
Several vorpal weapons are no more.  Declined tea with the (very
annoyed) Black Dragon, who doubles as a high priest of Evil.

Kheldar, the weasel, walks in after it's all over, and tries to take
credit for what his god did in the fight.  Typical.

Temple of Heimdall needs a new roof.  Not our fault.



                       hope that helps
                       (but not too much),
                                        -Myth.

"Shifters Run description","Allow me to elaborate on your condition and the situation (everyone 
please fill in items I miss):
In the last run Odin had just absorbed the soul of one Death Lord and 
redirected the Lich's link to Corellan.  This decreased the Dark 
covering Marden within a 1000' diameter around the temple of Heimdal. 
Some priests of Usul had launched some spells that further lit up the 
area.

We started the run by finishing the combat that Odin was in the 
middle of at the end of our last session.    Odin charged the Death 
Lord on Sleipnir and managed to survive long enough to hit him a 
couple times.  This weakened the Death Lord enough that its soul 
could be absorbed by the Orb.

Arioch re-appeared although he seemed to be exhausted and kept fading 
out.  Odin was next going to help Miriel (in the form of a platinum 
dragon) in her fight with a Huge Black dragon.  He dropped the Rod of 
Law to Arioch and headed toward Miriel.  Since Miriel was making 
every effort to stay alive but NOT kill the dragon, Odin looked into 
the future to find out what would happen if the dragon died. 
Apparently it was a High Priest of Arken and its death would have 
allowed Arken to join the battle.

Odin headed back to the temple to consult Arioch regarding the 
advisability of that course of action.

On the way he detected 6 Nazgul flying towards the temple and casting 
a ritual.  He updated Arioch (who began casting a spell) and took a 
position a few hundred feet above the temple (Sleipnir stepped in 
place).  He began a big spell.

Meanwhile, Lenore guarded the back of the church and D'Jon sealed it 
from the outside. Falstaff was still fighting earth elementals 
underground.  Inside the temple, Kielsorana was trying to keep the 
Doppleganger from killing E-Man (and then Kielsorana).  Peter, 
Maynard Crosshill (the Lord Chancellor of Heimdal, and Werner Simpson 
(the High Chancellor of Heimdal) did a lot to help.  There were also 
3 priests, 8 Shield, and Amud.  Kielsorana and E-man got kicked 
around a lot, but they managed to stay alive.  E-Man was out of 
commission pretty soon.  After he traded places with Kielsorana as 
the object of the Dopplegangers affection, he used his boon to Arioch 
to give Arioch all but a point of his Power.  Needless to say, E-Man 
was weak as a kitten after that.

Mordanith and Khalid were setting up to fight Khazad Gah (in efreet 
form) and another Efreet.  Khalid created a whirlwind around himself 
and Mordanith and they rose into the air.  Khalid used the Key to 
remove the fire from Khazad Gah and transfer it to the Efreet.  The 
Efreet died, but Khazad Gah was only injured.

The Nazgul's ritual was ripping up the temple of Heimdal and seemed 
likely to bring Arken.  Odin cast a 1000 point Bolt of Damnation 
using the Ravens and the Eye of Odin to target and tune the spell to 
hit all six.  He setup preset actions to immediately shape the power 
released and then Thaumaturgicly Peg it together.  The Bolt succeeded 
in making it so that Three Nazgul had never been.  The resulting 
energy was shaped to Life and then joined with one of the remaining 
Nazgul.  It ""died"".  Four Vorpal blades were destroyed.  The other 
two Nazgul were recalled before Odin could get them

Odin then headed for Khazad Gah who had just gotten thrashed by 
Khalid and Mordanith.  He charged on Sleipnir and through Lightning 
Bolts.  Khazad Gah Dreamwalked away and Odin followed.  Odin managed 
to get one Bolt of three to hit but only blew away his shields. 
Khazad Gah Dreamwalked three times and Odin followed until Khazad Gah 
used a risky Tactic: He Dreamwalked to Fire Mountain.  Then he left 
just as fast as he could.  Odin noticed Kay, Thor and many others 
fighting a retreating battle and joined them.  Mordanith had received 
word that Odin was going to be in trouble and had sent a Light 
grenade to Fire Mountain.  It exploded destroying the Net in that 
area (to what extent I don't know).

As soon as Kielsorana threw the Lich bit to Werner, Kielsorana and 
the Doppleganger were transferred to the Bridge.  Hercules grabbed 
both by the scruff of the neck while Ariel proceeded to determine 
which was which.  Once they determined which one had the worst 
personality, it was released and the other was dragged before the 
throne of power and destroyed.  Hercules was really beat up by the 
Doppleganger but it wouldn't take his form because one of Hercules 
properties is that he cannot be changed.  The Doppleganger obviously 
new this and didn't want to get caught in one form forever.

When notification was given that the Lich bit was in safe keeping, 
Odin and Kay guarded the retreat of the others.  Then the Black 
Dragon that Miriel had been fighting showed up.  Did you know that 
Odin and his High Priest have killed or damaged several Black 
Dragons?  More than any other color.  Apparently this daughter of 
Kisereth has a bone to pick and she wanted that bone to come from 
somewhere in the middle of Odin's chest.  Kay guarded Odin's retreat 
back to Marden.

When Odin got back to Marden and joined the others, the group 
received a message from the Fates, delivered by the Messenger, that 
indicated that for ""eliminating one of the 20, you may have the 
answer to one question"".

I have arranged for you to be put in stasis so that your condition 
doesn't degrade.  You were brought to the Ice Fortress with the rest 
of us when we went to discuss what question we should ask the Fates. 
When we finish the discussion I'll take care of your repairs.

Had you (or any previous incarnation of yourself) set up any preset 
actions or reality triggers in the event that you were rendered 
incapacitated?  (Now would be a good time to let us know)

So, I thought of building a cart and having the Guardian quickly run through
but we are limited in our entrance and exit sizes and there is a problem of
that gap in front of the door we are entering.

I have been going around and around in my head and I know there has to be a
neater solution then just opening the door and telling everyone to run and
when statistical probablility runs out throwing yourselves on the troll
until we win over the probability matrix again.

Any thoughts or help on this would be amazingly appreciated...

I think that you are making an unnecessary assumption though.  If you

If you were, for example. trying to move several thousand dwarves

for assistance;  If your cause supports the cause of ORDER, then I'm 
sure that one or more portals could be opened for you.  (other Death 
aspected gods can open portals to the Halls of the Dead, too.)

Taking several thousand (living) dwarves through the Halls would be a 
bit presumptuous, though, unless you have reason to believe that 
you'll get an OK from the Entities in charge.  As an FYI, that isn't 
Odin.

Reality manipulation is difficult around dwarves, but another 
possibility for you would be to create a ""tunnel"" through a more 
""ordered"" plane.

And you could just have them walk ...

		Well, as I see it, the biggest problem is the need for
Secrecy.  I 
		don't know any way of killing a troll quietly (Every time
Kheldar has 
		killed a Troll it's made a lot of magical noise).

			Killing this troll would be difficult.  It is at
least a stage 8 troll and seems to have some enhancements based on it
bindings to the place it is guarding.

		I think that you are making an unnecessary assumption
though.  If you 
		want to use the Halls of the Dead, why do you have to use a
specific 
		""hard"" entrance? (and why pick one guarded by a Troll?)

		Well- the problem is it is a HARD entrance- no magic or
divine permission required.  It is a bridge through the Halls between two
spots on the world.    To try and move thousands and thousands of Dwarves
through the Halls by any of the ""normal"" ways would be night onto impossible
and would be loud as heck magically.

		If you were, for example. trying to move several thousand
dwarves 
		from the Dwarven Mountains, then a minor, but significant,
percentage 
		of those Dwarves would be Odin worshippers.  Ask a paladin
of Odin 
		for assistance;  If your cause supports the cause of ORDER,

another 
		possibility for you would be to create a ""tunnel"" through a

		Sure... but this is ALSO VERY noisy.  This way involves no

the world can't be interfered with:-))

Is there another hard entrance in the destination city or does this hard
entrance allow you to exit anywhere you want?

I assume that the sword won't allow this warrior to move the Troll a
significant distance from the entrance.  If not, have the Mage create
a Reality Bubble and have the warrior direct the Troll into that Bubble.

Another option would be to have the warrior use the sword to slow
the Troll down enough that it could be surrounded by the dwarves.

		Hmmm ...

		Is there another hard entrance in the destination city or
does this hard
		entrance allow you to exit anywhere you want?
		NO.  This is a point to point tunnel.

		I assume that the sword won't allow this warrior to move the
Troll a
		significant distance from the entrance.  If not, have the
Mage create
		a Reality Bubble and have the warrior direct the Troll into
that Bubble.

		Reality bubble won't work in the Halls- unless it is cast as
a Discipline III and re-shapes the reality of the Halls.  VERY DIFFICULT.  

		Another option would be to have the warrior use the sword to
slow
		the Troll down enough that it could be surrounded by the
dwarves.
		Not useful- because then the Troll would spend the 1.2
seconds it would take to kill the 12 or 16 dwarves surrounding it and then
start killing more...  the idea is to save dwarves.

believes you to be ""authorized"" to give such an order?

Okay, so whoever designed this particular gateway and guard did a good
job...not perfect, what with the sword and the fortu able to get past it,
but...there's gotta be some other way...the owner/creator of this place
surely wouldn't have wanted just anyone to use it, but probably left a back
door...course, by the time you did the research and figured it out, the
dwarves could probably have done the overland thing, making themselves not
well like where they had traveled...

		Hmmm ...

		Is there another hard entrance in the destination city or
does this hard
		entrance allow you to exit anywhere you want?
		NO.  This is a point to point tunnel.

		I assume that the sword won't allow this warrior to move the
Troll a
		significant distance from the entrance.  If not, have the
Mage create
		a Reality Bubble and have the warrior direct the Troll into
that Bubble.

		Reality bubble won't work in the Halls- unless it is cast as
a Discipline III and re-shapes the reality of the Halls.  VERY DIFFICULT.

		Another option would be to have the warrior use the sword to
slow
		the Troll down enough that it could be surrounded by the
dwarves.
		Not useful- because then the Troll would spend the 1.2
seconds it would take to kill the 12 or 16 dwarves surrounding it and then
start killing more...  the idea is to save dwarves.

Troll's are kinda stupid that way. Experience from a game long since
ended: Trolls on patrol. We have to get past them. Smartass of the party
walks up to the head of the trolls, looks at him and says, I don't believe
you exsist. Troll thought about it, (failed his int check) said ok, and
continued on his way. We laughed then ran like hell before he realized
what happened.

"RE: Gaming (D&D) strategy problem - HELP","It is an interesting question as to who put the Troll there in the first
place.  For example, If the Troll was put there by someone from the Golden
Empire (after all Gruumsh did invent them).  If it is and it hasn't been
updated in a while (you know - the isolated japanese outpost long after the
war has ended syndrome) then perhaps someone in the Goldem Emperors armour
could convince it to let all of the Dwarves past.  Too bad we don't know
anyone like that.

Alternatively if we knew who put it there we might get some clue as to what
its orders are.  If it's orders are kill everyone in a 10' radius that may
not be helpful.  On the other hand if it's orders are to let no one pass but
those who know the secret sign we might be in luck.

Also, as far as D'Jan is concerned, it would be interesting to see who would
be best able to help Vardigan in his will rolls with the sword.  Would it be
D'Jan using divine enhancement?  Would it be Sigmund-Mage using Magic
enhancement?  Would it be Khalid using his Kua-Toa enhancer?  How about
Sigmund-Warrior using his leadership enhancement?  Fortu can be very
confusing to use and the man pages are generally not available. [Any opinion
on this one Alex?]

Thats all my thoughts for the moment but I think research would be a good
thing?

Hey, another thought.  Is this branch of the halls of the dead a standard
part of the Net?  If so is the Troll jacked in?  If he is can I hack his
brain or is there some serious black ice on it?  Also, if it is part of the
Net perhaps I can do some audit trailing to find out when the Troll was
installed and who has accessed it. [Any opinions on this one Alex?]

if there is any way that the dwarves can assist in the Will rolls,

I guess I misunderstood.  If the Troll isn't by the entrance (or 
exit) where is it?
(I was suggesting that the reality bubble be cast outside)

I guess I misunderstood again.  What kind of control does the sword give
the warrior over the Troll?

So I think you're all missing the really obvious thing here.  If this
troll was programmed long ago, there's one big exploit you should be
able to make WRT that programming.  All you should need to do is take
exactly 2000 dwarves past the troll at a time, and it'll see zero
dwarves and everyone will pass by unmolested.

I'll let everyone get back to making *real* suggestions now.

Up front, I'm REALLY sorry for this.  :)

That would work, unless they have some Kobald Programmers maintaining the
Trolls.

"Re: Gaming (D&D) strategy problem - HELP","Thank you everyone for helping me out with this..

However, I agree that research would help alot but the issue is time.  If
there is some game mechanics that would allow to be have Sigmund help me
research then I will jump on it for sure...  (sanda, can I get away with
that?)..

Also, I think there needs to be some simpler way then reality bubbles and
stuff like that.  Kay does have golden armour but the problem with Kay is
that he is also VERY noisy...  I would love to get that research..

What about simple solutions... a cart that guardian drags through the tunnel
at light speed.  I agree that whoever put htis troll here had a reason but I
do not think that they meant to make it impossible (which, by the way, it is
not) but he might have wanted to make it impossible to move thousands of
dwarves through :>

Sanda - what do you think about the fortu and their ability to augment
Vardigan?  Is that a possibility?

Any other thoughts or help would be greatly appreciated because I am truly
stuck and do not want to be personally responsible for wiping out the
Dwarven race.

There has to be a way!!!

"RE: Gaming (D&D) strategy problem - HELP","It seems very frightening to me that the SIMPLE solution involves dragging a
cart at light speed.  Do you remember way back in the days were we had
characters who had to think twice about getting through a locked door.
There were times when a large grumpy dog was a big impediment.  Oh well,
enough reminiscing.

In terms of the physics of it all I suspect the most efficient way to
transport a big number of dwarves (without equipement) is to put them all on
roller blades in one long line and pull them.  No seriously, If I recall
don;t these dwarves have big nasty things like catapults and seige towers?
Are we abandoning all of these?

Not to be technical but alex said the Job of the troll was to kill everyone
in the corridor.  What does kill mean?  Does it mean to remove all life from
an entity?  If so maybe some of the dwarves could adopt earth form.  I
believe Alex said that one of the Trolls senses was to detect all life in a
certain radius.  What if you ain't got none.

More likely it means to cause an entity to cease to be context generating
(i.e. cease to think in a way).  Dwarves are very poor targets for magic but
is there anything in the dwarvish repitoire of warrior skills/priestly
magics that might act like some kind of Zen ""I am not an animate entity
thing"".  If this were true we might be able to take some of the dwarves in
this state through without triggering the Troll at all.

I agree, it is possible that belief enhancement may not be the appropriate
way to enhance the application of Vardigan's will to the sword but I
disagree that if it is a strong will-based effect that means that Fortu are
no good at enhancing it.  It just means you need to be enhancing the right
thing.  I personally have a huge tool box of ways to enhance things related
to magic (of which will is one component).

Also, the Kua-Toa ""total enhancer"" that Khalid has may be of use here.  From
my knowledge of Kua-Toa disciplines it would be completely consistent for
them to have built such a device.  Also Alex has stressed on more than one
occasion that it is not just a power enhancer but a general skill enhancer.
On the loud scale, if it is Kua-Toa it may be a little noisy but it won't
compare to the volume of some draconic decree.

I do not know where I have gotten this impression but I think we probably do
not want to kill the Troll.  I suspect that at the moment the Troll blocks
anyone from easily traversing the path, including dark forces.  I have a
feeling that if this were an easy shortcut that the harms of this might
outweight the benefits.

Unfortunately I have no idea where this impression has come from.
Apparently Sigmund (as well as Pook) is a very intuitive character.  I
suspect this has to do with a lot of his fooling around in dreamwalking.

"Re: Gaming (D&D) strategy problem - The Balance ?","The Mistslicer issue has nothing to do with balance.  I am afraid she will
organize a surprise attack on the Dwarves... she is Dwarf slayer..remember?
She happens to hate dwarves and she knows that we are planning on doing this
but I changed the date already without telling Sterling...hence Mistslicer..

I understand that she is a diviner of great strengh but if she is smug in
her feeling that I will pour my guts out to sterling all the time then she
may not think to divine the date because she thinks she knows...

It could be a balance item due to the fact that I believe in the Chaos
theory and that small things impact in a large way.  Several thousand
dwarves joining the human army could be a turning point and the secrecy is
so that the Lich or his friends do not decide to ambush the army with a
bunch of vampires..

Does that make sense?

  So how about this?

I will have Lee do a reality trigger on 7,000 pairs of boots... the trigger
will need to be undetectable (at least by dwarves) and will trigger upon
entering the halls of the dead and be dismantled upon leaving the tree
(allowing them to get out of the way)..without making them fall down dead of
exhaustion on the other side.

It would allow the dwarves to move as fast as Guardian does without them
noticing..it is dark in the halls right..so they won't be able to tell.  He
can do the spell days before we do anything so the noise will be muted and
then I can have the Guardian deliver them with instructions to the Dwarves
that these are specially designed boots (make them look a little wierd) that
will get them through the hall without triggering any traps and such..

Do you think that will work?  Will the reality displine work in the halls??
I think that Lee can cast a discipline III...It is small but could help
alot...

As far as the seige equipment goes...I think that Dora will enlist the Fortu
(get in contact with Sigmund) to help bring that across.  What we can do is
bring all the metal pieces (the forged pieces with us) and we can
re-assemble on the Heimdella end while we are traveling..the wooden pieces..

Sanda - what kind of equipment are we talking about and would they agree to
that?  I was thinking maybe the fortu could bring over the large pieces at
10 times speed... Pookie - would sigmund agree to that?

This does not solve the problem entirely but it may cut down the fatalities
and Vardigan will make less roles.

We still need to drop the bridge over the gap on the first group so we do
not have to worry about tripping and the dwarves would still need to be
instructed to throw themselves at the Troll if it wakes up.

I think we tried this Vardigan - can you command it to sleep for an hour?  I
think that is still a continuous thing...isn't it?

I do not want to bring any gods or avatars into this because of the whole
knowledge, balance crap.  I have a much better line on the secrecy thing if
I do this without them.

The amount of endurance that the guardian would use up moving at that 
speed would make it impossible for him to do multiple trips in your 
time frame.

I LOVE this idea.  Build your cart and have Vartigan ride in it on 
each trip with the Dwarves.  Have him make the Troll carry you 
through at its speed.

By the way, I think that the best thing to do for research is to talk 
to Anubis.  A high(er) level priest of any of the faiths that use the 
Halls should be able to contact him.  If he doesn't control the 
Troll, he can probably tell you who does.

I am not sure it would save a lot of time to put like 20 dwarves in a

"Re: Gaming (D&D) strategy problem - SOLUTION?","Hmmm...interesting....

That might work.... The only bad thing is that if the Troll wakes up the
Dwarves are kind of dead meat sitting there in barrells... hmmm..

Can anyone think of a bad side to this plan?

"Re: Gaming (D&D) strategy problem - SOLUTION?","I know it is unlike me but I just wanted to introduce a note of reality here.

A Gaurdian can out run a troll.
A Guardian apparently can out run a troll while carrying one dwarf.
While gaurdians are bitchin strong they do acknowledge the concept momentum and
hence a gaurdian will not be able to pull one thousand dwarves as fast as it
could pull one.

Doing some quick calculatios:

Assume 1 dwarf weighs 100 kg (probably more with armour and weapons)

Let us assume also that we have arranged something so that all of the dwarves
travel on a frictionless surface (rollerblades, skis,etc.) but the Guardian
still has traction. Since we probably can arrange lets assume we have four
gaurdians (Kelthi, Trevaine, Gallek, Sigmund).

Also it occurs to me, aren't there only 700 or so dwarves in existence?  I
assume they are not all coming so isn't 500 dwarves a more appropriate number?

Lets adjust our estimate just to be realistic and say a dwarf averages 200kg
after his axe and plate armour are added in (440 lbs.).

Total dwarvish mass 100,000kg = 100 metric tonnes
Probable length of the line of dwarves (1m/dwarf) = 0.5 km

Now here is the biggy, force able to be applied by a Gaurdian:
After you include skills Sigmund in Gaurdian mode probably has a lift of
~1200lbs (call it 5000 Netwons).  This seems small and the biggest question is
what is the efficiency conversion between lifting a weight straight up and
pulling a weight across a frictionless surface.

For the moment lets assume four gaurdians can exert a force of 20,000N.  This
corresponds to a train acceleration of:

a = F / m = 20,000 / 100,0000 = 0.2 m/s^2

Lets say we have a 5km runway (total so 4.5 km of usable space).  Our gaurdian
locomotive can now accelerate its 0.5km long dwarf train in a time of:

using d = v0 * t + 0.5 * a * t^2 with v0=0 we get t = sqrt( d * 2 / a )
sqrt( 4500 * 2 / 0.2) [s] = 212 [s]

I forget what Vardigans will roll rate is but lets say he makes a roll every 5
seconds.
Lets say the effective length of the halls is 5km and the Troll tries to kill
everything in the hall.
We can then calculate the total time from start till leaving the hall (plus
0.5km).

using d = v0 * t + 0.5 * a * t^2 with v0=0 we get t = sqrt( d * 2 / a )
sqrt( (5000 + 500 + 4500) * 2 / 0.2) [s] = 316 [s]

This means that some dwarf will be in the hall for a period of:

316 - 212 = 114 [s] or 23 rolls

OK, this is already starting to look a little shaky.  Why don't I recap the
basic assumptions and then get some better numbers from Alex.

ASSUMPTIONS FOR THE FORTU-DWARF EXPRESS TRAIN

1. We can get all of the dwarves in a line with frictionless feet and none of
them fall down
2. Number of dwarves = 500 {Nd}
3. Average dwarf spacing in a line = 0.5 [m] {Sd}
4. Average dwarf + weapons + armour = 200 [kg] {Md}
5. Average gaurdian fortu effective force = 5000 [N] {Fg}
6. Number of Gaurdians = 4 {Ng}
7. You have a runway to get up to speed on in front of the entrance
8. Length of the runway = 5000 [m] {Lr}
9. The halls of the dead are pretty straight
10. Effective length of the segment of the halls of the dead being travelled =
5000 [m] {Lh}
11. There is space after the exit so you dont slam the freight train into a wall
12. The required frequency of Vardigan's will rolls = 5 [s] {Vf}

Based on this:
Fortu-Dwarf Train Acceleration = ( {Fg} * {Ng} ) / ( {Md} * {Nd} ) = {A}
Distance from start to entrance (minus train length) = {Lr} - {Nd}*{Sd} = {L01}
Distance from entrance to exit (plus train length) = {Lh} + {Nd}*{Sd} = {L02}
Time from start to entrance = sqrt( 2 * {L01} / {A} ) = {T01}
Time from start to exit = sqrt( 2 * {L02} / {A} ) = {T02}
Number of rolls Vardigan needs to make = ( {T02} - {T01} ) / {Vf}
Velocity of the dwarf train at exit = {T02} * {A}

Other than the shear ridiculousness of it, it just might work.

I assume there is also some max speed for Gaurdians (a non-linear HP curve).  In
the above example velocity at exit would be 63 m/s or roughly 136 mph.

Holy shit!!! I would not want to deal with 100 metric tonnes of dwarf flying in
at 136 mph on the receiving end of this package.  Are these numbers realistic?

The amount of endurance that the guardian would use up moving at that

CHris is right.  Even the guardian could not do it.  ANd you would be hard
pressed to build carts that could hold fully equipped dwarves and survive
being pulled at that speed.

I LOVE this idea.  Build your cart and have Vartigan ride in it on 
each trip with the Dwarves.  Have him make the Troll carry you 
through at its speed.

Alex responds:
No way.  Vardigan has top make will rolls just to keep it at bay.  IT can't
understand langauge- it copuld not be told how to pull a cart.  It only
knows how to kill/destroy/eliminate context genrating beings.

CHris says:
By the way, I think that the best thing to do for research is to talk 
to Anubis.  A high(er) level priest of any of the faiths that use the 
Halls should be able to contact him.  If he doesn't control the 
Troll, he can probably tell you who does.

Alex replies:  Now that is a good idea- though it is a SHapeshifters scale
of idea rather than a Dora and Sterling sacale of idea. :-)  (Shapeshifters
is another group in the same campaign that is VERY VERY high level)

Just a little comment from someone who actually worked on trains.  :)  There
is this little issue known as slack action.  Basically it is due to the fact
that a train isn't a single rigid body, but a series of them with a certain
amount of give between each member.  When starting a train the locomotive
pulls the first car, first taking up the slack, then there is a small bump
as the car is quickly accelerated up to the locomotives speed.  This is
experienced at each coupling.  The result is that your Guardian taking off
at a dead run will probably snap his train somewhere in the middle.  Now
since we are dealing with frictionless surfaces we could also assume
unbreakable rope (magical?).  I have no idea about what that means for your
magical noise and reality bending Hoobie Doobies, as that is way out of my
realm.   But with magical rope, and an effort to stretch out the train first
to reduce slack action, you could probably get things going.  The big
problem I see is stopping.  See, this slack action thing works in reverse
too.  Since the guardian is the only breaking force at the end of the
journey, it will stop, and the first dwarf will run up it's slack of rope
(0.5m) and smack into the guardian and then begin it's deceleration.  Then
dwarf 3 into 2, 4 into 3 etc.  This would work, but it is a bit
uncomfortable. Lots of jarring.  However, I remember the dwarf containers
being discussed as spherical or something to eliminate catching on things.
If that is the case, when attempting to stop, you won't just all mush into
each other, you will have a sort of billiard ball effect, where say 4 hits
into 3 and shoots off at a 45degree angle, with the added bonus that they
are all tied together and thus pulled around.  End result, big old jumble at
the end.  I assume the dwarves will be protected in their cases, but the
guardian will have a couple bruises, I would imagine.

Hmmm.  If the tunnel is relatively straight, and flat, could the dwarf
bubbles be loaded into a ramp and rolled thru the tunned.  (Dwarf Bowling!)
The players could then attemt to distract the troll by making oggie boogie
faces at it while the bubbles shoot by.  I would recommend a test bubble
first, empty to see if it would roll thru.  Mabye even add to it by altering
reality such that the start of the tunnel is at a higher potential energy
than the bottom, enought that the dwarves will roll ""downhill"" but not so
much as that the surrounding countryside would want to fall thru the hole
too.

Which gives me another thought.  Bury the troll!  Or use some kind of
superglue to hold him in place as the dwarves run by.  Release him
afterwards with a solvent.  If the troll is magic resistant, don't attack
him directly with magic, but use the magic on the surroundings to affect the
Troll physically.  Mabye throw a rock to mud under the troll, let him sink,
and then a mud to rock.   Holds him in place.  Everyone trundles thru the
passage and then you rock to mud again to free the troll and run like heck!

Random ramblings.
By the way, what system are you playing in?  All this talk of reality
altering, magical noise and whatnot has been outside my D&D experience.

"RE: Gaming (D&D) strategy problem - SOLUTION?","This was very cool Pookie but here are some facts about the situation that
make it less applicable: 

(1) The length of the corridor is more like 50 meters.
(2) There is a 100 meter deep cave and then a 2.5 meter wide, 3 meter high
door going into hall on the Dwarven mountain side..  
(3) There is a 1.5 meter gap between the door entrance to the hall and the
start of the hall.  The depth of that pit is unknown but indications ar eit
would not be good to fall in.  
(4) The tunnel itself is only about 75 meters long(my notes aren't here but
that is about right), wider and higher than one can see, poorly it by a glow
from the fog, and the floor is a gravelly sort of floor covered by a cold,
white fog about two feet deep that obscures the floor (and by the way the
pit at the dwarven mountain entrance (oops! :-))
(5) There is a 1.5 meter wide by 2.5 meter high doorway out of the Hall into
the cave entrance under the root sof the tree in Heimdella.
(6) That cave is a long narrow mess hall kind of thing.  Its ceiling
(covered with roots) is about 3 meters high, its length is about 200 meters
and its width is about 10 meters.  The doorway to the Hall is a concealed
door in the middle of one of the long sides.  Almost directly across from it
is a set of stairs going straight up to the surface - it is about twenty
steps, is about 1.5 meters wide and about 2 meters tall.

ALl this being said I think the pulling strings of objects or dwarvbes won't
work- both because of the surface of the floor, the geometry of the spaces
AND ther eis a resistance in the gate doorways- I don't know how much
fristion ther ewould be on a rope or cable pulled through the gates.  When
people step through they feel a resistance like pushing into and through a
wall of jello.

Other facts:
GUARDIANS:
A Guardians base lifting strength is around a 240.  This means the Guardians
lift potential is (bench press ten times)about 4800 pounds or about 2400 k.
I figure a naked Mountain Dwarven warrior in good shape is about 160 pounds
or about 80 kilos.  Their armor and equipment though is probably no more
than 50 kilos.  SO we could say each Dwarf is no more than 130 k.  A
character is un-encumbered at a tenth of their lift potential- therefore a
Guardian would be unencumbered carrying one dwarf or maybe two- and if a
sling or harness could be built to distribute the weight the effective
weight of the dwarves could be halved so theoretically a Guardian (by the
way- A Guardian is a low intelligence, 2 meter+ tall stone golem of
unbelievable speed and strength.  One of them is bound as a servant to one
of the player characters and others of them are affiliated with the players,
a player character is even one of a related ""model"") could carry thre eor
four dwarves and run unencumbered.
TROLLS:
The troll seems to USUALLY(I hate that!) start in the pit.  There is usually
a 2-4 second delay before it reacts to intruders- then it responds with
great speed.  
DWARVES:
POOK- the Dwarven army is 11,000 strong.  THIS is a STATE STATE SECRET!!!
SIGMUND DOES NOT KNOW THIS!  AS FAR AS ALL non_dora and sterling PLAYER
CHARACTERS ARE CONCERNED THERE ARE BARELY A THOUSAND DWARVES ON THE PLANE! 
THE GATE:
The gate is also a state secret- it is only know to high level
administrators in Prince Kay's adminsitration, Karl and a few hundred Orcs
under General Tross that are all sworn and oathbound to secrecy!:-) 
And now- the Mountain Dwarven army and Dora and Sterlings group! 

-----Original Message-----

I know it is unlike me but I just wanted to introduce a note of reality
here.

A Gaurdian can out run a troll.
A Guardian apparently can out run a troll while carrying one dwarf.
While gaurdians are bitchin strong they do acknowledge the concept
momentum and
hence a gaurdian will not be able to pull one thousand dwarves as fast
as it
could pull one.

Doing some quick calculatios:

Assume 1 dwarf weighs 100 kg (probably more with armour and weapons)

Let us assume also that we have arranged something so that all of the
dwarves
travel on a frictionless surface (rollerblades, skis,etc.) but the
Guardian
still has traction. Since we probably can arrange lets assume we have
four
gaurdians (Kelthi, Trevaine, Gallek, Sigmund).

Also it occurs to me, aren't there only 700 or so dwarves in existence?
I
assume they are not all coming so isn't 500 dwarves a more appropriate
number?

Lets adjust our estimate just to be realistic and say a dwarf averages
200kg
after his axe and plate armour are added in (440 lbs.).

Total dwarvish mass 100,000kg = 100 metric tonnes
Probable length of the line of dwarves (1m/dwarf) = 0.5 km

Now here is the biggy, force able to be applied by a Gaurdian:
After you include skills Sigmund in Gaurdian mode probably has a lift of
~1200lbs (call it 5000 Netwons).  This seems small and the biggest
question is
what is the efficiency conversion between lifting a weight straight up
and
pulling a weight across a frictionless surface.

For the moment lets assume four gaurdians can exert a force of 20,000N.
This
corresponds to a train acceleration of:

a = F / m = 20,000 / 100,0000 = 0.2 m/s^2

Lets say we have a 5km runway (total so 4.5 km of usable space).  Our
gaurdian
locomotive can now accelerate its 0.5km long dwarf train in a time of:

using d = v0 * t + 0.5 * a * t^2 with v0=0 we get t = sqrt( d * 2 / a )
sqrt( 4500 * 2 / 0.2) [s] = 212 [s]

I forget what Vardigans will roll rate is but lets say he makes a roll
every 5
seconds.
Lets say the effective length of the halls is 5km and the Troll tries to
kill
everything in the hall.
We can then calculate the total time from start till leaving the hall
(plus
0.5km).

using d = v0 * t + 0.5 * a * t^2 with v0=0 we get t = sqrt( d * 2 / a )
sqrt( (5000 + 500 + 4500) * 2 / 0.2) [s] = 316 [s]

This means that some dwarf will be in the hall for a period of:

316 - 212 = 114 [s] or 23 rolls

OK, this is already starting to look a little shaky.  Why don't I recap
the
basic assumptions and then get some better numbers from Alex.

ASSUMPTIONS FOR THE FORTU-DWARF EXPRESS TRAIN

1. We can get all of the dwarves in a line with frictionless feet and
none of
them fall down
2. Number of dwarves = 500 {Nd}
3. Average dwarf spacing in a line = 0.5 [m] {Sd}
4. Average dwarf + weapons + armour = 200 [kg] {Md}
5. Average gaurdian fortu effective force = 5000 [N] {Fg}
6. Number of Gaurdians = 4 {Ng}
7. You have a runway to get up to speed on in front of the entrance
8. Length of the runway = 5000 [m] {Lr}
9. The halls of the dead are pretty straight
10. Effective length of the segment of the halls of the dead being
travelled =
5000 [m] {Lh}
11. There is space after the exit so you dont slam the freight train
into a wall
12. The required frequency of Vardigan's will rolls = 5 [s] {Vf}

Based on this:
Fortu-Dwarf Train Acceleration = ( {Fg} * {Ng} ) / ( {Md} * {Nd} ) = {A}
Distance from start to entrance (minus train length) = {Lr} - {Nd}*{Sd}
= {L01}
Distance from entrance to exit (plus train length) = {Lh} + {Nd}*{Sd} =
{L02}
Time from start to entrance = sqrt( 2 * {L01} / {A} ) = {T01}
Time from start to exit = sqrt( 2 * {L02} / {A} ) = {T02}
Number of rolls Vardigan needs to make = ( {T02} - {T01} ) / {Vf}
Velocity of the dwarf train at exit = {T02} * {A}

Other than the shear ridiculousness of it, it just might work.

I assume there is also some max speed for Gaurdians (a non-linear HP
curve).  In
the above example velocity at exit would be 63 m/s or roughly 136 mph.

Holy shit!!! I would not want to deal with 100 metric tonnes of dwarf
flying in
at 136 mph on the receiving end of this package.  Are these numbers
realistic?

Troll claws are effectively equivalent to Vorpal blades and their 
strength is obscene. I can't think of any way to do it fast enough to 
ensure that the Troll couldn't bring its talents to bear.

Alex says:
That is my general inclination as well. Just so you can get how gross I
imagine that Trolls are: I imagine their lifting strength is triple a
Guardians.  Their claws are unbreakable (literally- they ARE unbreakable)
and RAZOR sharp- they could tunnel through solid rock- and at frightening
speeds- if they needed to.

experience.

The game system is something Alex put together called Bardic Tales. The
paradigm 
of the world that includes reality shifts and such is also a product of
his fevered 
imagination. It is fun but you can sprain your brain on it.

Alex says: 
To be fair Bardic Tales is not just a product of my fevered imagination-
though I am its well spring- it is the product of years and years and years-
over a decade- of work by a lot of people including a lot of the people on
this list: Jim, Lara, Chris, Dave, Pook, etc. and many that are not.

"Re: Gaming (D&D) strategy problem - SOLUTION?","OK, so perhaps I had the geometry of the caves completely wrong and the number
of dwarves low by a factor of ten.  Nobodies perfect.

On a side note, Gaurdians are about 3 times stronger (for lifting purposes) than
I thought.  If we ever do need to pull the Train-In-Vain thing someday four
gaurdians could get a really huge load moving really fast.

BTW:  Sigmund has also been through this hall with Dora and Kelthi.

So anyway, just to recap though it probably won't work:

A hypothetical dwarf train would now be 11km long and weigh 1430 metric tons
(using Alex's weight estimate).

This train would need to:

Start in the dwarvish halls
Run down a 50m corridor
Run through a 100m cave (I assume 100m deep is not vertical drop)
<TROLL DANGER>
Go through a 2.5m x 3m doorway with a gelatinous resistance
Jump a 1.5m pit of unknown depth
Run down a 75m hall
Go through a 1.5m x 2.5m doorway with a gelatinous resistance
</TROLL DANGER>
Run down a 200m cave
Climb a 2m high staircase

I will think some more.

Let's re-examine the problem from a different angle:    Get dwarves from
point a to b, past nasty troll.
Problem is not locomotion or transportation of dwarves.  The little buggers
got legs.
Problem is detection by and damage capability of the troll.

Troll's annoying features are speed, strength and sharpness of claws and
incredible magic resistance.

Let's think of methods to eliminate these.
Vorpal blades work great on solids, but are not too effective on liquid/gas.
(OOH you sliced it!  It flows back into place.)

Strength is only a factor if you can apply it against something.  Ie a
creature with infinite strenght that is floating doesn't punch as hard, the
forward momentum of the fist is balanced with a backwards movement of the
rest of the body.  That's why officials don't break up hocky fights untill
they fall down.  When two guys are standing on skates punching each other,
the damage is minimized.  Just the velocity and mass of the arm, instead of
that plus the hip rotation and legs and other body parts that are fixed to
the ground with a boxer.

Could you hold the troll in place for enought time to secure a harness under
it's arms and hoist it into the air?   Since it is suspended, it can not
chase the dwarves
nor apply force to anything.  It would just swing there.  Mabye upside down
from one leg, making it difficult to reach the harness with it's claws to
cut it.

If you magically dug a pit in the tunnel and lured/pushed the troll into it
could you make it deep enought that it would take more time to get out than
for the dwarves to get through?
Are trolls boyant?  If you dropped troll in an ocean, would it sink to the
bottom?  Earth to Mud a pit instead of dig and it may give more time.


Can you create a reality bubble of water or some fluid the same density as
the troll, around the troll, so it would be stuck in it.  Though mabye a
zero gravity bubble would be better, since the troll could swim out of the
fluid, but it would be harder to push against air in the gravity bubble.

What is this gelatinous resistance?  Is it keeping the troll in place,
or is
it the programming?  Or is the programming ""stay within the Jell-O"".
Can
you duplicate the substance?  If so, make a jell-o wall and put it in

Alex replies:
For some reason I am being highly productive between these gaming posts!
Remarkable!  :-)  

The gelatinous resistance is a function of the ""space dilation""(known in the
Discipline parlance as a reality wall) between the exit out of the cave in
the Dwarven mountains and the entrance to the Hall.  Like wise on the other
side.  That 75 meter corridor effectively covers about 1400 kilometers in
the outside world as the dragon flies.
I prefer cherry jello walls to contain my trolls.

"RE: Gaming (D&D) strategy problem - SOLUTION?","OK....

  So Geoff came up with an interesting plan that is slower but may work...

We get the four guardian fortu that we know of (or at least that Sigmund
knows of)..since they can outrun the troll them we have them bring the
Dwarves across two or three at a time each...

When they get tired we do the Vardigan/Troll control thing for awhile until
he gets tired and then we start the cycle again...

Just using the Guardians it would be approx. 10 Dwarves a shot and that
would take 700 trips..using Vardigan as well..running 6 abreast ..actually I
cannot do this calculation because I do not know the endurance of the
Guardians..

Also, can the Guardians outrun the Troll if he is already up and waiting for
us...that is another question...

This may take a few days (maybe Pook could figure it out for me) but it
involves the least amount of magic, the least risk and is not too fancy.  I
am probably still going to talk to Anubis (though I will have to figure out
how Dora would figure that out) because there may be something simple as
saying ""Friend"" or something like that... unfortunatly things like that come
at a price..

So, thoughts on this solution?  Geoff's other thought was to have Guardian
hold on to Vardigan and if he loses control of the Troll have the Guardian
pick up Vardigan and run him around the tunnell while all the Dwarves in the
tunnel get out and until Vardigan can make his will roll again...   There is
something about that plan that I do not like...

E-man and Peter will be gathering the pattern information through a 
Mirror that will allow us to see Sigmund just before the Doppleganger 
jabs him through the eye.  If the battle had ended at that moment, 
Sigmund would have been able to self repair whatever damage he had 
incurred.  Mordanith will use that pattern information for a Restore 
to Pattern.  A Restore to Pattern with *that* pattern will not 
negatively effect Sigmund since he gained no experience, and 
basically went downhill, after that point.

I'll do what I can to increase the mana level in the lab.  Pentos and 
Peter can boost our draw rates if necessary.  Pentos and I will 
monitor Sigmund and assist as necessary.  I'll also work with 
Mordanith to set up Wards so that nothing comes through the Mirror 
and we'll have Shiva (a guardian Fortu) monitoring that Ward during 
the process.  We'll do this work in the lab at my mansion on the

-------------------------

Calculate your stats as they would be about a half hour after our 
arrival at the Ice Fortress.  That is when the characters will work 
on Sigmund.  I guess I hadn't realized that E-Man had a high rank in 
Restore to Pattern.  I'm not sure that it will do us any good, 
though, where he doesn't have much energy to cast.  Perhaps we can 
get some kind of modifier to Mordanith's cast because he'll be 
assisting/advising.  Plus, E-Man and Peter will be doing the Read 
Pattern, so they'll have to be connected to Mordanith to transfer the 
Pattern.

"Re: Sigmund Repair","Just a couple of notes:

1.    I can always offer up the lab I am building in Marden.  It is pretty
primitive compared to the one at the Manision but it is very close to the action
physically and there is nothing in it yet that is to valuable to lose.

2.    I don't know if it helps but I always carry my rod.  The rod is probably
attuned to me at the moment I went hard but I would not be two suprised if there
was a hysterisis effect with haalite (or the item itself) that might let you
reach back a bit through it.  I don;t know if that would be safer than using the
mirror to open a portal to then.

3.    Another interesting strategy is that at the time of the battle I was
actively in divine commune with the Fortu deity.  Now I personally know that the
Fortu deity has some pretty powerful Divine Programming skills and other cool
stuff uncluding the fact that Fortu backing up to wards is a normal ward (and
hence Fortu) ability.  The question is, can someone like D'Jan, contact the
divine Fortu entity given that I am wounded.  Does that mean that the divine
Fortu is wounded?

For the most part I will leave it up to you guys since I am unconcious so it
would be bad role playing for me to have to many opinions.

BTW:  Ben is doing fine and is up to 6 lbs. 3 ounces (we had a little scare when
Ben dropped more than a pound and a half in the first week).  Andrea and I are a
little fuzzy because we are on a strict every three hours feeding schedule (day
or night).  I am just experimenting with working from home now.

"Re: Gaming (D&D) strategy problem - SOLUTION?","I have done some preliminary calculations and come up with the following:

With out using time-dilation Sigmund-Gaurdian should be able to
grab-run-check-and-return a 3 dwarf package (sans armour) in 6 counts.  This is
based on
1 count to grab
1 count to pass the first barrier
15 counts to dash 75m and jump the pit
1 count to pass the second barrier
1 count to drop and reverse
1 count to pass the second barrier
15 counts to dash 75m and jump the pit
1 count to pass the first barrier
---
36 counts or 7.2 seconds (for a 150m dash - for comparison the world's record
for 100m dash is 9.85 seconds and they dont have gelatinous barriers or 240kg
weights to contend with)

At a time dilation of 6:1 this makes 1.2 seconds per trip.

Unfortunately even using all my tricks this burns 11 END per second which means
a one minute insertion burns aproximately 660 END (which I don't quite have) and
(with four gaurdians) moves 600 dwarves.

In order to keep this up for a sustained period we would need about 8 hours rest
(to regain the exhaustion) and then we could repeat the process.

Actually, if I can use both reduced endurence for high rank (caution
rules-optimizer at work) and ranks of critical to reduce endurence then the burn
rate drops to 5 END per second which means a one minute insertion burns only 300
END (leaving me 55% exhausted).

This requires only 4 hours between insertions to make steady state and thus it
would only take 73 hours (or 18 trips over 3 days) to move the dwarves.  Luckily
Gaurdian Fortu are really stupid and don;t mind boring work like this at all.

I think the best route for optimizing this is to work on increasing the number
of dwarves per trip.  This solution requires Vartigan to make 18 minutes worth
of rolls but they are spread out over a good amount of time.

Oh, the other thing is if their were an easy way to regain the exhaustion faster
than 4 hours of rest that would cut down on the total time even though it would
not change the number of rolls required.  Still, I think three days is a bargain
for moving the dwarvish army so I suspect any ""loud magics"" would not be worth
the risk here.

Sanda - could the hammer be used to reduce exhaustion on the fortu?  We
could possibly spend the an extra day to bring the armor across in bundled
units...Dwarves will need to come across with their weapons and there will
be no discussion on that point I am afraid... sans armor will be bad
enough...if we had to do it with them in armor how would it change the

"RE: Sigmund Repair","Restore to Pattern is NOT a healing spell to use on sentient beings!

Restoration is limited to the depth of pattern perceived by the spell,
which is usually less than that of the caster.  Victims of this spell
eventually become simple expressions of their former pattern, the
magical equivalent of toons.

Eman is STRONGLY against this use of the spell!


                      -Eman, Restore to Pattern Advisory Board.


It might be better to summon his essence from that time, much as we
did with Kilsorana and the Void.


                      -Myth, wondering what all the fuss is about
                             (After all, Sigmund's already a toon.)

		I have done some preliminary calculations and come up with
the following:

		With out using time-dilation Sigmund-Gaurdian should be able
to
		grab-run-check-and-return a 3 dwarf package (sans armour) in
6 counts.  This
		is
		based on
		1 count to grab
		1 count to pass the first barrier
		15 counts to dash 75m and jump the pit
		1 count to pass the second barrier
		1 count to drop and reverse
		1 count to pass the second barrier
		15 counts to dash 75m and jump the pit
		1 count to pass the first barrier
		---
		36 counts or 7.2 seconds (for a 150m dash - for comparison
the world's
		record
		for 100m dash is 9.85 seconds and they dont have gelatinous
barriers or
		240kg
		weights to contend with)

		At a time dilation of 6:1 this makes 1.2 seconds per trip.

		Unfortunately even using all my tricks this burns 11 END per
second which
		means
		a one minute insertion burns aproximately 660 END (which I
don't quite have)
		and
		(with four gaurdians) moves 600 dwarves.

		In order to keep this up for a sustained period we would
need about 8 hours
		rest
		(to regain the exhaustion) and then we could repeat the
process.

		Actually, if I can use both reduced endurence for high rank
(caution
		rules-optimizer at work) and ranks of critical to reduce
endurence then the
		burn
		rate drops to 5 END per second which means a one minute
insertion burns only
		300
		END (leaving me 55% exhausted).

		This requires only 4 hours between insertions to make steady
state and thus
		it
		would only take 73 hours (or 18 trips over 3 days) to move
the dwarves.
		Luckily
		Gaurdian Fortu are really stupid and don;t mind boring work
like this at
		all.

		I think the best route for optimizing this is to work on
increasing the
		number
		of dwarves per trip.  This solution requires Vartigan to
make 18 minutes
		worth
		of rolls but they are spread out over a good amount of time.

		Oh, the other thing is if their were an easy way to regain
the exhaustion
		faster
		than 4 hours of rest that would cut down on the total time
even though it
		would
		not change the number of rolls required.  Still, I think
three days is a
		bargain
		for moving the dwarvish army so I suspect any ""loud magics""
would not be
		worth
		the risk here.

Not to chime in in agreement but Myth is right on the money!!!!!!!!!! 

That is why people don't do restore to patterns on powerful people when they

		Restore to Pattern is NOT a healing spell to use on sentient
beings!

		Restoration is limited to the depth of pattern perceived by
the spell,

this spell
		eventually become simple expressions of their former
pattern, the
		magical equivalent of toons.

		Eman is STRONGLY against this use of the spell!

"Re: Gaming (D&D) strategy problem - SOLUTION?","This is a good reality check.  It seems like it would be hard to beat a straight
march through the tunnel since it is only 75m long. The issue is if the Troll
breaks loose how many dwarves are in peril.  In the Gaurdian case there is a
chance that all of the occupants of the corridor can be evacuated.

Still, if we can get Dwarves marching 4 abreast at 1 m/s and spaced at 1m then
11,000 dwarves takes (11,000/4 + 75) s = 2825s = ~47min

If Vartigan can swing it this is definately the best.  You need a bridge over
the pit of course (Dwarves can't jump for beans).  If the Troll gets loose it is
a slaughterhouse of course and you could lose up to 75x4=300 dwarves (plus
Vartigan which would be a bummer).

This plan should definately not be discarded.

Ward space?  I'm sorry, you must have misunderstood.  We're not going 
to do this at the Ward, we're going to Kheldar's Fortu lab at his

It actually isn't close at all.  We are all currently in a conference

Kheldar doesn't know either but that is why he plans to use the 
mirror.  Sigmund and Kheldar have talked about this a lot before but 
without KNOWING how to use the haalite, he'd rather go for a pattern 
that he knows will work.  Once Sigmund is back he should do some 
research about the rod and then let some others know how it could be 
used it to help heal Sigmund if he was rendered inactive.  I think 
you are right, but now isn't the time for research (or he'd be 
experimenting with something new that he acquired recently).

That is something that you and Alex should discuss.  Alex, let me

"RE: Sigmund Repair","That IS what we did for the Kilsorana ritual.  We developed ""Restore 
to Pattern"" specifically for that situation.  We didn't actually 
""summon"" Kilsorana's essence.  She went into the Void and was NOT. 
What we did was to get a near perfect blueprint of her pattern (her 
True Name) and recreated her (Damned good job, too).

This is different from the Kilsorana event in two major ways.  On the 
downside, we do not have Sigmund's True Name.  On the upside, we 
*have* Sigmund.

When we use undamaged Sigmund as a reference for repairing damaged 
Sigmund, we are not recreating Sigmund from scratch.  Therefore there 
is nothing missing, at least not as a result of our spell.  Even if 
we aren't repairing him to the exact way that he was, we aren't 
adding anything that he wasn't.  This should at least get him 
operational enough to complete his own repair.

Based on the feedback that we've had from NPC's, I think of RtP with 
this analogy.  RtP is flawed in that its maximum resolution to 
""restore"" is subject to the resolution that is passed to it by the 
""scanner"".  So if we start with a 1200dpi sentient being and we get a 
600dpi pattern, then we end up with a 600dpi being.  If there is a 
better way to ""heal"" then RtP should not be used.  If, however, we 
have a 1200dpi being with a hole in it, then RtP can be used to ""fill 
in the blanks"".  This should be sufficient for the subject to be 
functional once again, with the gap being filled with a ""Band-Aid"" 
until complete healing can occur.

By the way, I have done a lot of research on Haalite.  It may be that 
I have derived enough knowledge from this research to use it as the 
input source for the pattern.  As I'm sure that Sigmund would tell 
you, if he were able to communicate with us, his Rod is Haalite and 
it contains his pattern.  Read correctly, it should be the ideal 
source for his ""undamaged"" pattern.  I will seek guidance from the 
SPIRIT OF THE UNIVERSE (Alex?) to determine if I have sufficient 
knowledge to use it in this fashion.

If not, there are limited options available to us.
1) Fortu DI,
2) I can attempt to bring the Machine sufficiently on-line to restore 
Sigmund as I would restore myself.
3) I can get out my old blueprints and restore him to what he was 
when I built him, which is almost certainly not what he was just 
before the Doppleganger got him.

I welcome any other suggestions, but the final say regarding 
procedure will be given to the Fortu, including Drellan and, if the 
other Fortus agree that it is safe, Big Brother.

Wherever we do it, and however we do it, interfacing with that event will
put us in dangerous space, and appropriate (i.e., world-spanning paranoid)
precautions should be taken.  If we can arrange it, some sort of extreme
slow motion might give us an advantage in defending against things from the
other side.  We'll need it anyway, just to see Sigmund.

Also, I am under the impression that some events are particularly hard to
divine, given the large numbers of interfacing defenses, restrictions,
powers and egos in play.  I suspect our walk on the wild side of Marden may
be one of those.  We should account for this.

On the Kilsorana front, the pattern we used was her True Name, as given by
the gods of her people.  That should be a darn sight more accurate than any
description of her we might obtain through Read Pattern.  (I was also under
the impression that we defined the spell, at least to the outside Reality,
as 'summoning her from the instant just before she was destroyed.)

With Sigmund, we could certainly use Restore to Pattern (or the simpler
Restore Pattern skill) to provide a matrix for the gap that Sigmund's
natural healing mechanism could then re-pattern and incorporate into his
form.  (The equivalent of using coral for missing bone mass and letting the
body recalcify it.)  In fact, I would recommend that use of the spell, in
that Sigmund will otherwise be working around the fact that he is leaking
integrity all over the floor, and may be too busy dying to recover at all.

For his pattern, we have several options.  First of all, he (unlike
Kilsorana) is already here, just terribly hurt.  We don't really need to do
tricky things with time and space to get a pattern for him, as he and his
pattern are standing right in front of us.  If we want to splint his
pattern, and provide a reminder of its unwounded state and a guide for it's
recovery, we can certainly do that.  It is the method Eman is most
comfortable with, and should provide the most accurate though slowest)
recovery.

We could also infuse Sigmund with an earlier version of his pattern, either
from his rod or by summoning it from a previous version of him.  Riskier,
due to bandwidth constraints and the fun places he tends to get hurt in.

We could use Restore to Pattern to make a copy of the wounded Sigmund, and
replace him with it just before he was wounded.  A minor causality loop, but
the gods won't tell and we won't notice the difference.  Whatever the
doppelganger may have noticed is now, blessedly, a moot point.  Riskier
magically, but much safer for Sigmund.

We could also Discipline him, defining him as whole and unwounded, trickier,
but safer for him than for us.

If none of that works, I'll just get some mortar and a trowel...

This probably doesn't make a difference in your point but RtP is a

"RE: Sigmund Repair","Most of this stuff is not, IMO, needed to repair Sigmund.

For one thing, he's not dead, or even Voided.  He does, admittedly,
have a whopping great hole (tm) in him, but I am not aware of anything
that would have damaged his base pattern other than the inductive
effect of massively damaging his physical form.

Patterns heal.  All of them.  All we need to do is provide an
appropriate structure for that, take steps so that he doesn't die in
the meantime, and wait.

As a Patterner, I would advise against grafting on parts of old
patterns to plug the wound.  Aside from the difficulty of matching the
edges correctly (and you thought wallpaper was tricky!), patterns
change over time, slowly on some levels and rapidly on others.  The
end result of a pattern-patch is likely to be the equivalent of a
badly-set bone.  While such might well be preferable to death, we are
not performing field surgery here; we have a stable patient and our
choice of techniques and facilities.  (Besides, I don't want to see a
Fortu jihad after we cripple their god.  Not that I would see it for
long, mind you.)

The simplest and safest approach seems to me to be to devise a plug to
insert into his wound that would maintain his basic integrity and
encourage the regrowth of his own natural (at least according to the
current definition) pattern.  The plug could then be subsumed by his
pattern as it heals, and provide the elements it needs to continue
growth.

Maximum safe healing would be to leave him in 'hard' mode for this,
but I'm guessing that would take between 50 and 500 years.  Current
estimates indicate that his pecu-- er, particular abilities may be
needed to save the world some time before that.


After we have his hole plugged, we might want to toss him in a tank of
the appropriate elements, as patternless as possible, and let him
operate as a seed crystal, imposing the pattern he needs on the raw
(or even tuned) elements.  Kheldar's knowledge is probably essential
here, since most of the physical/elemental structure of a Fortu is
probably the same as when he built them.  (Checks new history text.. )
I mean, when he developed the species.


Getting DI from the god of the Fortu might not hurt, either.  He, if
anyone, should know the appropriate patterns.  Heck, he might even
tell us Sigmund's True Name.  (Ya.)

      The real answer is that it depends drastically on what is being asked
and what the ramifications of the aid are.


    It would be a aid with a major air working (several actually, but all
identical).  It would create a weapon that would be used primarily by humans
but could also be used by elves.  The weapon could easily be designed so
that it would be ineffective if used against the elves.  In fact, that could
be a major reason to have Aerdrie involved instead of human Air Mages: her
involvement would insure that the weapon could not easily be turned against
the elves.

    [JimJM]   I think you may very well need a major elven caster. I am
pretty sure that Aedrie is NOT the one you want. Labelas is possible if the
need is for sometiung in Faery.

    Come to think of it, I'm going to need Wood Elf assistance with this
project no matter what happens.   I'm definitely going to need to do that in
person, but anyone with a good (intelligent, relatively stable) contact in
the Wood Elven community would be helpful.


    [JimJM]  CovenTree's mage (oliver ? Olivia ? anybody ?) might be a
choice.


       You can get help from Aedrie ( Adrianna, Adyni, etc) for any task but
I would suggest that you exhaust all other Elven avenues first: Kilsorana,
Kilsorana as near-Avatar, Mordanith as Mage, Mordanith as Priest (separate
powers and roles), the Woodelves, etc...

    Do any of your listed (or unlisted) suggestions have major dominion over
the Element of Air?
    [JimJM] Kilsorana as near-avatar, Mordanith in both guises and Taliesin
can gain access to the Air Pattern as necessary. It is a big deal and would
not be granted to us without damn good reason but the Book of Winds is there
to be read :-)

      Besides I would be VERY careful with her, she is the
""grower/maintainer of constantly evolving patterns"" so the Odin (relatively
static ) world view is NOT her favorite.


    Thank you for saying relatively static.  Still, I think that it is
important to restate Odin's world view:
    90% of his reason for existence is ""guardian of constantly evolving
patterns"".  Odin's Order allows patterns to exist.  He is directly opposed
to the forces of Kisereth and No-Rennan - Chaos and Destruction.  Strictly
speaking, if the Lich would stop mooching on other Gods' domains, Odin would
leave him alone.

    [JimJM] I am afraid that the definition of pattern we are using is
different  enough that we could spend a long time in dogma hell. As far as
the elves are concerned and Aedrie in particular, ODIN is the protector of a
specialised (nearly crystalline) subset of patterns that allow for some more
crystalization over time but not much else. This isn't bad (as long as it
stays contained on the prime) but it isn't healthy either. In some respects
she is the person managing the changing paths of rivers that you are trying
to build near or dam. Odin's opposition to the chaos gods is almost
immaterial (thats not her yob mon..).

      She is the least likely to help you in any task without direct finger
pointing from Correllan. Part of her
      role involves not being visible and not making deals with others.
Labelas will be more willing to talk since he is really the Big C's ""Avatar
in Charge of the Prime..."" sort of. And even then, if you go to him for
something you could have gotten from Mordanith or Kilsorana in their ""Elven
Point Source of Power"" roles the results would be scathing at the least.


    Understood.  My thought here is that what I am looking for is
magecraft/discipline work beyond the capability of player characters alone.
It makes no difference to Kheldar who ""puts a foot through the bridge"" (so
to speak), he just needs someone to put his foot down.
    [JimJM] Remember that where a Faer-Han or other elf is, he is. If the
need is for information or knowledge we can probably handle it without
direct Avatar intervention. Avatars are needed when tactical decisions are
replaced by oin the spot strategy decisions (or when you need much more
power in one place than a mere elven mage can wield.) At the moment it
doesn't sound like that is needed. If it must occur on this plane or
concerns this plane for most jobs it is Mordanith, Kilsorana, Taliesin,
other high priests, or Labelas.


       Remember that as Odin, you now emanate a field of constant ordering
that irritates the hell out of the more structured elves like Mordanith.


    It will not be ODIN making this request.  I understand what you are
saying, however, and it is still somewhat true even for Kheldar.   Kheldar
is specifically looking for another Deitic Air source to balance any
involvement that Odin will have through Kheldar.


    Be very clear, no matter how it may seem to the players:
           Kheldar and the Avatar of Odin are NOT the same entity.


    Kheldar is shaping the evolution of the perception of Odin on this
plane.  He is changing and becoming more a part of the Odin over-mind in the
process.  But Kheldar the Man (who is High Priest of Odin) and the Avatar of
Odin (who is often seen with Kheldar's companions) are two Different
entities, with diverging goals.


    A perfect example of how I am running these two personas is this:  If
Miriel were in danger and going to save her would hurt the cause of Odin,
Kheldar would probably attempt to save her.  The Avatar of Odin would not.

    [JimJM]  I am  very clear on that. It is why I shaped my reply as I did.
But given the scope of the avatars only Labelas will interact with you as
that distinct dial-a-role sentient. That IS his Job.
    For Aedrie you would be Odin, that is your only reality she would
consider pertinent. Sylvanus, if you could get his attention, would interact
with you in whatever role you wanted, to him they are
    all equally irrelevant. Only your request would register.

  Maybe I have the name wrong.  Who is the elvish Goddess of Air?
  [JimJM] The Mahjor Elvish Avatars are

  Labelas Enoreth (aka Labalas, Lva, and Sidrin ) = Time Lord, Plane Guard,
Keeper of the Book of Winds, Marshall of Wards, and other names
      This is the avatar that answers all but the most major of DIs on the
prime and faery. Most high elves gain their DI through him.

  Adrianna (aka Aedrie, Adyni, Aerlanne) = Grower of the ever changing
patterns, Giver of gifts
      This is the avatar that aids and guides the Sword. She is the
maintainer of the most subtle and alien (to humans) of elven patterns. Rumor
has it that she was involved in the formation of many of the support
patterns for the current crop of incarnates. The Priests that manage
communication with the Pattern are connected to her as well as those of
other, more hidden, organizations. Has not been seen outside of faery in her
entire span. This includes before the Bridge.

  Sylvanus (aka WoodDream, Ash, etc..) = Maintainer of that which is Other
of the prime (trees and other potentially Faery related context generators)
      Most wood-elves interact with his creations/creatures as spirits and
such. Typically no direct DI (as in point-to-point connection) but lots of
supporting DI via trees and such.

  During the golden empire all of the Faer-Han were Avatars. The
introduction of the Bridge changed this for the prime. Now only those who
can carry the power across to the Prime
  are called avatars.

  All of the Avatars have been called gods at one time or another. Notably,
Sylvanus has more names as a god than you can shake Kheldar at. How did you
get hold of Adrianna's name ?

  Who in our party knows Olivia and how well?
  [JimJM] Waitamionute ! His name is Gulliver ! Khalid seems to know him
pretty well.


  OK.  In your opinion, which of these would be best able to manipulate
several thousand points of power over a period of a few hours?
  [JimJM] Taliesin  is ruled out right now since he is still recovering from
his flame out in the wizard king battle.He won't be wielding any large lots
of power except in the most threatening of emergencies.
  [JimJM] Kilsorana or I are both capable of it. Mordanith can handle 1345
spell without a control roll for quite awhile. Kilsorana can do nearly as
well.


  I'd prefer not to spend a long time on dogma either, but I don't want to
have something stated that isn't the case.  Odin is not a builder (except
Asgard, his own little piece of the universe).  Odin does not try to enforce
regimen - that is Arioch (LAW).  Odin is ORDER.


  Odin makes it possible for different groups to have different rules.  It's
Odin's job to make sure that the Prime is not destroyed, Kerestaen is not
destroyed, Hell is not destroyed, dragonhome is not destroyed, etc.  The
entities that live there can do almost anything that they want within their
own area.  He's like the United Nations and Aroch is the US.  While Aerdrie
manages the changing paths of rivers, Odin makes sure that Kisereth and
No-Rennan don't destroy the water and the ""earth"" that it runs on.


  OK.  Enough of that - it is unimportant for the conversation at hand.

  [JimJM] OK. All that is really important  is for you (as Kheldar & Odin &
Morphus) to understand that what you believe and what the Elves believe are
completely different. What you say to this matters little.
  To the elves you emanate a reality that denies your words. It is as though
you lecture on only building in stone while constructing a house out of
wood. No great harm, but there are few inconsistencies. It is very much like
the on going debates between Richard Stallman and the Open Source advocates.
To Stallman, software is only free if no one can prevent it from being
distributed in source form. To the open source community it is free if is
distributed without any restrictions at the point you ship it. A subtle
difference, but it makes for an almost unbreachable commuication gap.

  So the important thing for now is recognition that there is a gap. But now
that I think about it. It is only important to the Elves. K/O/M will
continure to ignore it in his usual (sometimes creative) manner.

        It would be a aid with a major air working (several actually, but all identical).  It would create a weapon that would be used primarily by humans but could also be used by elves.  The weapon could easily be designed so that it would be ineffective if used against the elves.

        [JimJM] Kilsorana as near-avatar, Mordanith in both guises and Taliesin can gain access to the Air Pattern as necessary. It is a big deal and would not be granted to us without damn good reason but the Book of Winds is there to be read :-)

          Besides I would be VERY careful with her, she is the ""grower/maintainer of constantly evolving patterns"" so the Odin (relatively static ) world view is NOT her favorite.


        Thank you for saying relatively static.  Still, I think that it is important to restate Odin's world view:
        90% of his reason for existence is ""guardian of constantly evolving patterns"".  Odin's Order allows patterns to exist.  He is directly opposed to the forces of Kisereth and No-Rennan - Chaos and Destruction.  Strictly speaking, if the Lich would stop mooching on other Gods' domains, Odin would leave him alone.

        [JimJM] I am afraid that the definition of pattern we are using is different  enough that we could spend a long time in dogma hell. As far as the elves are concerned and Aedrie in particular, ODIN is the protector of a specialised (nearly crystalline) subset of patterns that allow for some more crystalization over time but not much else. This isn't bad (as long as it stays contained on the prime) but it isn't healthy either. In some respects she is the person managing the changing paths of rivers that you are trying to build near or dam. Odin's opposition to the chaos gods is almost immaterial (thats not her yob mon..). 

          She is the least likely to help you in any task without direct finger pointing from Correllan. Part of her
          role involves not being visible and not making deals with others. Labelas will be more willing to talk since he is really the Big C's ""Avatar in Charge of the Prime..."" sort of. And even then, if you go to him for something you could have gotten from Mordanith or Kilsorana in their ""Elven Point Source of Power"" roles the results would be scathing at the least.


        Understood.  My thought here is that what I am looking for is magecraft/discipline work beyond the capability of player characters alone.  It makes no difference to Kheldar who ""puts a foot through the bridge"" (so to speak), he just needs someone to put his foot down.
        [JimJM] Remember that where a Faer-Han or other elf is, he is. If the need is for information or knowledge we can probably handle it without direct Avatar intervention. Avatars are needed when tactical decisions are replaced by oin the spot strategy decisions (or when you need much more power in one place than a mere elven mage can wield.) At the moment it doesn't sound like that is needed. If it must occur on this plane or concerns this plane for most jobs it is Mordanith, Kilsorana, Taliesin, other high priests, or Labelas.


           Remember that as Odin, you now emanate a field of constant ordering that irritates the hell out of the more structured elves like Mordanith.


        It will not be ODIN making this request.  I understand what you are saying, however, and it is still somewhat true even for Kheldar.   Kheldar is specifically looking for another Deitic Air source to balance any involvement that Odin will have through Kheldar.


        Be very clear, no matter how it may seem to the players:
               Kheldar and the Avatar of Odin are NOT the same entity. 


        Kheldar is shaping the evolution of the perception of Odin on this plane.  He is changing and becoming more a part of the Odin over-mind in the process.  But Kheldar the Man (who is High Priest of Odin) and the Avatar of Odin (who is often seen with Kheldar's companions) are two Different entities, with diverging goals.


        A perfect example of how I am running these two personas is this:  If Miriel were in danger and going to save her would hurt the cause of Odin, Kheldar would probably attempt to save her.  The Avatar of Odin would not.

Well, I'm not sure it is as absolute as you seem to state here.  Eman
can (and does) speak with great authority on Patterning, for instance.
There are many things he KNOWS about it, whether or not they are
actually true.  If Alex is aware of a discrepancy between Eman's
knowledge and my own, or between Eman's knowledge and the generally
accepted belief systems of another culture, he will often gently point
it out.

You are the ultimate authority on what ODIN -believes- is true, and
what he chooses to do.  Same for Kheldar.  You are also a non-ultimate
authority on what all those Odinists are like, and are pretty well
informed on the Norse pantheon, the Five, and a few other areas of
interest.

Jim is the ultimate authority on what Mordanith believes and what he
chooses to do, is a lesser authority on CORRELLAN and the Elven
priesthood, and is pretty well informed about Faerie, Balance, the
Book of Winds, and some other unimportant stuff.

None of us can truly state what IS.  All we have is our memories, our
theories, our perceptions and our beliefs.  Some of these may be in
agreement.  Many of them are not.   Mordanith and the Elves are
perfectly capable of seeing ODIN in a manner which contradicts his own
perceptions of who he is.  They may be deluded, they may be keenly
insightful, or they may just be coming from a very strange place.
Perhaps Jim can better explain the Elven viewpoint on the matter (I
suspect that Elves are beings of thinly-disguised chaos, myself), but
it is =only= a viewpoint.

"RE: Game Mechanics","Game MechanicsWARNING: Long diatribe

Personally I (Pookie) am divided on this issue.  The core issue that I see
in Chris's last post is a game-playing issue rather than a game-universe
issue.  In most respects I am a proponent of gaming being a cooperative
venture where each player has the greatest freedom and support from other
players to develop there own characters except that Alex harshly rules over
all of us limiting our characters from the true world dominating potentially
that they obviously have :-).

This position however places me on both sides of this issue.  The reason can
be seen in the following two examples:

1.    Sigmund is a Fortu and at the same time is also (secret information)
Nureyev.  As such the nature and origin of Fortu are fundamental to his
character.  Kheldar is one of the five and was involved very closely when
the Fortu first came into existence.  Therefor this is also fundamental to
his character.

2.    Sigmund used to be Nureyev who used to be the Kua-Toa
Olactalan-Tlovanu (or at least so I assert).  Even though my Kua-Toa
heritage is in my dimly buried past and I do not have good memories about it
I have taken as strong interest in describing the Kua-Toa.  One major aspect
of the Kua-Toa (as I assert it) is that they are deathly enemies of the
Slaad.  As such I have done some describing of the Slaad.  I am not sure
what the source of his information was but Odin/Kheldar/Chris?  had a
slightly different impression of the nature of the Slaad as a race.

In the first case I think Kheldar and Sigmund have rationalized their
world-views (which are very relevant as they are now both within the active
memory of the characters).  By some degree of compromise, some degree of
just agreeing not to examine certain issues to closely and some degree of
leveraging the ever-useful reality shift to explain why both interpretations
of certain issues are true depending on which side of a reality shift you
are standing on.   I can't speak for Chris but from my perspective I feel
like we are not completely unified in world-view but it is working well.

In the second case I think I have leveraged the fact that the thing we had
different opinions about was so long ago and so dimly remembered that it is
not suprising our characters memories are different.  Also, becuase of the
nature of the third epoch - as demonstrated by our recent run,  I think that
it is perfectly consistent that both interpretations be the truth about
reality for different people at the same time (it was a fuzzier world back
then).

In truth, I use the same philosophy when it comes to elves.  Specifically
there are a number of things that Mordenaith thinks are impossible that I
believe are possible and a number of things that he thinks are hard that I
think are easier (probably not easy).  Over the course of the game I have
just chalked this up to (a character's) perception of reality generates the
rules that they operate against.  I am not saying we can all just decide to
do anything but I am saying that it didn't seem inconsistent to me that
different characters would operate under different rules and limitations
(including to some extent fundamental principles of magic) based on their
worldview.

Anyway, to put an end to a long diatribe and bring this back into the realm
of talking about game-playing:

I think that it is a wonderful gaming opportunity for each character to be
able to guide the development of their character (within the parameters set
by Alex).  I also recognize that becuase we operate in the same consensual
universe (and we are getting mighty big as entities in the universe go) we
have interdependancies and things I assert about my character will have
implications on your character and vice versa.

As such I think it is good if we all work together to rationalize our
worldviews but I also think that it needs to be acceptable for me to dictate
my characters view about what the Truth is about Odin and Mordenaith and
have this be different than these respective characters self perception.

This is all spoken from the perspective that there is no such thing as
player knowledge - only character knowledge and there is no TRUTH, only
truth relative to a specific worldview.

<<Side Note>>
BTW:  Sometime we should have a discussion about what the difference between
the following things are:
Objective vs. Subjective (I believe this is the fundamental Kua-Toa vs.
Slaad conflict)
Order vs. Chaos (It sounds like this might be the Odin vs. Loki conflict)
Law vs. ???  (Is this Arioch vs. whom?)

Alex once said that even Loki (the master of illusion) would be on the
Kua-Toa side if we were re-fighting the objective vs. subjective battle.

  See below:


      [Chris]I'd prefer not to spend a long time on dogma either, but I
don't want to have something stated that isn't the case.  Odin is not a
builder (except Asgard, his own little piece of the universe).  Odin does
not try to enforce regimen - that is Arioch (LAW).  Odin is ORDER.


      Odin makes it possible for different groups to have different rules.
It's Odin's job to make sure that the Prime is not destroyed, Kerestaen is
not destroyed, Hell is not destroyed, dragonhome is not destroyed, etc.  The
entities that live there can do almost anything that they want within their
own area.  He's like the United Nations and Aroch is the US.  While Aerdrie
manages the changing paths of rivers, Odin makes sure that Kisereth and
No-Rennan don't destroy the water and the ""earth"" that it runs on.


      OK.  Enough of that - it is unimportant for the conversation at hand.

      [JimJM] OK. All that is really important  is for you (as Kheldar &
Odin & Morphus) to understand that what you believe and what the Elves
believe are completely different. What you say to this matters little.
      To the elves you emanate a reality that denies your words. It is as
though you lecture on only building in stone while constructing a house out
of wood. No great harm, but there are few inconsistencies. It is very much
like the on going debates between Richard Stallman and the Open Source
advocates. To Stallman, software is only free if no one can prevent it from
being distributed in source form. To the open source community it is free if
is distributed without any restrictions at the point you ship it. A subtle
difference, but it makes for an almost unbreachable commuication gap.

      So the important thing for now is recognition that there is a gap. But
now that I think about it. It is only important to the Elves. K/O/M will
continure to ignore it in his usual (sometimes creative) manner.


  Ahh, we've skipped beyond dogma and we're now into game mechanics.  I've
started a new thread and included the rest of shifters.


  I understand the concept that the Elves may believe something different
than what Kheldar or Odin believe [Note: Morphus is just a name; Kheldar and
Odin are separate entities].  What is important here is what Jim
Jackl-Mochel believes, because it was Chris and Jim that were talking.  When
I send email in character I sign it Kheldar or Odin or whatever.  When I
send as a player I sign as Chris.


  I've trailed behind you, Pookie and Alex in our discussions about all of
us having different knowledge (not opinions) of the way that the game
universe IS.  But this seems to be more than I can handle.  Within the
constraints imposed by Alex, it is my opinion that each of us has Absolute
Dominion over our characters.  No other player tells me what Kheldar is or
is not, and I do not tell any other player what their character is or is
not.  People make suggestions, but the player decides about his character.


  Likewise about those Forces in the game that are most connected to us.
After Alex (for all of these examples), Pookie and I define the
characteristics of the Fortu and the Ward.  And I take a back seat to both
[though not the Machine] with regards to the current Reality.  Jim JM and
Lara handle the elves and in most aspects Lara takes a back seat to Jim
(although not with Green & Sea elves).  Pookie define's the Koa-tu.  Myth is
clearly taking the lead on The Wizards Council, Patterning, Weaving, and
some aspects of Air.  Amy and Pam may or may not be doing much, but they
both have more input than any of us on Nature and Madra.  Geoff on
Electromancy.  Jim JM - the Dal Kon.  Lara - Dwarves.  Dave Wall - Dao Shao
warrior culture.


  That being the case, how can you say that  Kheldar or Odin emanate a
reality that is contradictory to Chris's words?


  And the Stallman/Open source example may or may not be pertinent here.
What matters in that discussion is the definition of ""FREE"".  My definition
of FREE is that I can have it without paying for it.  FREE does not speak to
ownership.  If someone says that I can have something only if I use it in a
certain way, then it doesn't matter whether I pay for it or not, the
restriction is still there.  So what is at issue is not that the source
isn't FREE, but rather that the Individual is not ""free"" to do with the
source as they please.

"RE: Game Mechanics","Game MechanicsMe thinks the magnitude of the Just-Dont-Get-Itness factor is
proportional to the square of the distance between the centroids of the
reality establishing nexus of the conversations of which two entities
primarily belong.  This distance being measured across both planar
seperation and temporal displacement with spatial seperation being an
insignficant correction term.

The inverse of the Just-Dont-Get-Itness factor will be the liklihood that
any two entities will give up in disgust trying to have a philosophical
argument.  The volume of the resulting tirade and the depth of frustration
experienced will the proportional to the Just-Dont-Get-Itness factor
multiplied by the level of abstraction of the concept with respect to the
domain in which the two entities are having the conversation.  If the
entities are not actually coresident and are arguing via some communication
medium the chance for personally injury will be decreased but the
frustration factor will increase exponentially based on the distances
between the conversants.

Regardless of where they are currently situated the centroids for Odin and
Mordenaiths belief systems are Valhalla and Faerie, although both of them
are partially bound to the prime.

Sigmund on the other hand (apparently) argues from a belief system that is
grounded in the third epoch.  Even though I (try to) operate on the reality
that I perceive as happening in the prime I think my concept of what is
reasonable and possible is from a completely different time and place.

    [JimJM] Ho Boy. At this point I want to swear a little since this is not
a trivial tangle.

    The problem with responding with a clear statement of role (such a
signature) is that it is often insufficient for the task at hand.

    So, often in my posts I am responding in more than one role: As
Mordanith (role1), As Jim (role2), As the Partial Definer of the
elves.(role3), or sometimes as a generic game designer (role 4). My last
posting was not targeted about absolute reality at the game level though I
see that it could have been taken that way:

    So to restate:

    As Mordanith: ""Of course, the basic reality that you are emanating is
countervailing to that of Adrianna""

    ... Possibly long discussion in which Morphus details the differences
between his reality and Odin's and what Odin's responsibities, viewpoints,
and reality...

    Followed by:
    Mordanith: ""Of course, the basic reality that you are emanating is
countervailing to that of Adrianna""



    As the Partial Definer: ""Most elves, and especially the Faer-Han will
have the same reaction to Morphus and echo Mordanith's statements.""
    As the Partial Definer: ""Elves will have a hard time understanding the
Kheldar insistence otherwise
_because_they_cannot_take_on_the_human_reality_is_sort_of_solid_
    viewpoint"" ""Only elves such as Taliesin, Labelas, and a few others can
comfortably think from that viewpoint. The end result to those who cannot is
that Kheldar appears to be
    denying reality as any elf can see it...""

    As Jim: My porly choosen FSF/Open Source metaphor was intended to
illustrate that there is a deep gap in base viewpoint so that the Elves and
Kheldar are left with the feeling that the other ""just doesn't get it"". And
what is more I was trying to convey that I thought that Kheldar would be
clear that that is the same feeling that the Elves are left with.


    Bemused,
        Jim

"RE: Game Mechanics","Talk about confusion.  I thought that I'd gotten lost in mechanics 
land again.  Since I tend to sign ""Chris"" or ""Kheldar"" at the end of 
my messages, address my messages to specific characters when I talk 
in character, and only talk third person about Kheldar when I'm 
speaking as Chris the player, I assumed that you were doing the same. 
Especially since I used the United Nations analogy and you used the 
Stallman analogy.

I think that it is very important for all of us to distinguish 
between when we are characters speaking to other game entities and 
players speaking to other players.  Also, we shouldn't use modern 
analogies.  When we use computer terms to speak about the Fortu or 
the Ward, we aren't speaking in character.  We are players 
communicating to other players in terminology that we (the Players) 
understand.  The characters have a conversation that exists below our 
level of information transfer and they don't use terms like pentium 
or computer.

This same thing holds true when we as players discuss how to enhance 
the game world environment.  When a few of us got together at that 
restaurant and talked about how the Kua-to environment might have 
been, it was not, in my opinion, Kheldar, Mordanith, and Sigmund 
doing the talking.  Do you agree, or was I confused then, too?

Making them permanent ? Maybe.  Making them context generating ? Very
scary. The Air part is definitely the Elven baliwick. But doing it to
earth falls into the realm of others that don't nercessarily play well
with elves. Let me think about this one and talk with Sanda about

It wouldn't actually be earth.  It would be Nature, the substance in

Rather brutal world view coming up:

My guess would be that he, like the Golden One Leader whats-is-name...,
caused the creation of a new race. 
The base pattern is of Correllan and most of the power returns to
Correllan in the end (as it does for all 
but the elves gone Eldar such as Sephus) and they may very well treat
Mannan as a god, why not ? For most of 
Correllan's creations it isn't important to him that they worship him,
just that they achoieve their/his goals.

Unless, of course, it serves the Bug C's purpose to have the power
ground out to Mannan in which case only Mannan's
death would bring the power back to him.

I think so.... It would not have occurred to me either... because I am
not
sure the sea-elves see themselves as strongly connected to Correllan but
why
would they not be..

I would have to agree with you... I guess the more direct question is,
does
Mannan think he is an avatar of Correllan?

Likelihood: Almost non-existant- the Lich has almost the same chances of

Literally!!!! :-) 

Mordanith has very little chance of capturing her attention as well because
he is a Warden and thus under Labelas' dominion.

That was why I was thinking Divine Air; I'd hoped to have the Air 
restructured to allow the objects to Fly.  But if Evocation is the 
way to go, I'll have to give some thought to who the best entity is 
to assist.

(1) I like characters to particiapte under almost all circumstances and I
susbscribe to the gradual background buidling of context theory of game
management.

(2) Chris is both right and wrong (Go not to the GM for answers for he makes
you soggy and hard to light) in his saying that the consensus reality is the
TRUTH.  Ther eare theories CHris about the nature of relaity that have the
consensus reality be only one form of the truth with many different
variations.....there are various ways of looking at reality.  Each has its
strength and weakness someof which break the rules of the other
versions.....:

will     - WILL
individual reality (Slaad meta-physics ends right there)  -WILL/WORD
consensus reality (the seat of Draconic meta-physics) - WORD/WAY
aggregate reality (the seat of Kua-To meta-physics) -WAY

This is not a simple concept or question at AT ALL.  Scholars and
philospohgers and scientists in our world have argued about these things for
millenium!  I am clear that Chris, for instance (I mean CHris, not Kheldar
though the same MIGHT be said) lives primarily in the aggregate world.
Pookie and I live far more in the individual reality.  Jim is somewhere
inbetween.  These are of course just my personal assesments and I place no
value judgement on the superiority or inferiority of any particular one
whatsoever. I think part of the gap in understanding/worldview comes from
these philospohical differences.  
*shrug*  It is a fascinating topic.  I put Britt and Lar ain the consensus
reality level.  *shrug*

This has something to do with the ""Just Verifying"" message which I 
also didn't understand.  What do you mean by Will, Word and Way here? 
Or consensus versus aggregate?

All Heidegger talk aside: If any one of you can flap your arms and 
fly, please show me.  Otherwise, We (the Players) all live in the 
same world, where the same rules of physics apply to all of us 
whether we believe them or not.  The same events shaped the 
development of the world that we live in, whether we know what they 
are or not.  90% of the Philosophers in the world's history have been 
individuals who were creative enough to get some rich, less creative 
schmuck to pay for their room and board.

You can philosophize all you want, but unless you can show me that 
you are right by doing something that most sane people think is 
impossible, then I'll take it for granted that we live in the same 
world, with the same history and the same rules.

Pookie, if you (or anyone that you know) can go astral at 10:00 PM 
Friday night and tell Shapeshifters what I am doing at that moment, 
I'll be more receptive to real-world differences in philosophy.

As for the game world, we (the Players) have an advantage that the 
characters (and people in the real world) do not.  For discussion 
purposed, we (the Players) can KNOW what really happened at a 
specific event without needing to be concerned about what Joe's view 
of the event was versus Jill's view of the event.  Those things do 
come into play, but since we are making up the event AND Joe's view 
of the event AND Jill's view of the event, we do not have the same 
advantage that people in the real world have: a common event from 
which different people remember or know different things.

To have the game make any sense at all we MUST agree on a common set 
of facts from which to form different opinions of WHY those events 
happened.  Without that common set of facts we waste each others time 
and become homicidally frustrated.  Well, I do anyway.

As I said Chris you are firmly in the world of the aggregate reality.     It
is a world of objects with rules and conditions which are consistent and
unchanging for all people.    You do have a dos eof consensus reality in the
sense that you are willing to believe in ""arm-flapping"" causing flying if
enough people demonstrate it for you.  

One of the tenants of the ""individual reality"" school is that your universe
will never contain anything that you don't allow in it therefore it is
unlikely anyone will ever ""prove"" astral travel to you.  By the way- in
general I am 100% agreement with you.  But it does not HAVE to be that way.

Your point about philosophers- that they are primarily fast-talking
hucksters that get room and board through slick talk is essentially correct.
However, it does not belie the fact that they have some fundamental  truths
under their belt.  

However, this is a longer conversation than is practical on e-mail but I
would love to talk about it!    Let me just assert, to which you are welcome
to disagree, that it is not AT ALL as cut and dried as you have made it out
to be.

If you treat the ""reality"" of the game world as completely 
subjective, even to the player, it makes keeping track of things more 
difficult.  It makes planning character actions more difficult.  I 
realize that this affects me more than it affects the rest of you. 
This is undoubtedly because gaming is a higher priority for me than 
the rest of you.  I am therefore more frustrated when I do not 
extract as much efficiency as I possibly can from every gaming 
discussion.

When I am asleep I can do anything that I want, but it does not 
effect anyone else.  Reality is that which affects you even if you

If you treat the ""reality"" of the game world as completely 
subjective, even to the player, it makes keeping track of things more 
difficult.  It makes planning character actions more difficult.  I 
realize that this affects me more than it affects the rest of you. 
This is undoubtedly because gaming is a higher priority for me than 
the rest of you.  I am therefore more frustrated when I do not 
extract as much efficiency as I possibly can from every gaming 
discussion.

When I am asleep I can do anything that I want, but it does not 
effect anyone else.  Reality is that which affects you even if you

In some cases you can't.  In those situations, why add complexity 
where it isn't necessary (Occam's razor).  In other cases you can 
gather data to prove one theory or another.

The Heisenberg Principle states that you can only MEASURE one 
characteristic of a moving particle.  It does not say that the 
particle HAS multiple masses or velocities depending on who looks at 
it.

I have no problem with theories.  But until it is proven, I'd like to 
live my life with what IS proven.  For example, I'm agnostic.  When I 
die, if I show up at the pearly gates I will apologize for not 
following the instructions of the church.  Until then, I intend to 
continue eating meat on Friday, and other more venal sins.

>Me, I'll stick with the old consensus-building adage:  ""If you can't

exactly.  But we, as players, CAN tell about the game world.  We have 
the advantage that we CAN know what IS in the game world.

It makes a difference when you are a player planning to manipulate

Again, you can posit that, but why?  Why implement a more complex

I beg to differ!  If you spend several billion dollars on a space 
mission and you plan to bump into a crystal sphere, your going to be 
in for a big surprise!  And the tax payers are going to be very 
unhappy.  Just look at the shit NASA has been getting for the Mars 
mission.

The point is, if we ARE in the same universe and you get from one 
side of the grand canyon to the other by flapping your arms, then I 
(and others) must perceive your movement in some fashion.

In that example, it doesn't matter how many people is ""few"" and if it 
is physical enough to be proven, then it is a sufficiently physical 
definition.

The key word here is BELIEVE.  Regardless of what people BELIEVE, in 
the real world it doesn't CHANGE what IS. People don't BELIEVE that 
smoking is healthy now because they have evidence to back that up. 
Whether they believe it or not, though, doesn't change what IS.  In

that capability, if we grant it to our selves.  The game is complex 
enough as it is, why make it more so if we don't have to do so?

Possible but not probable.  If three billion people in the real world 
believe that nerve gas won't injure them, I""M NOT TAKING OFF MY GAS

>Particularly in the BT universe, where Belief is practically a law of

THEY don't plan anything.  CHRIS plans the actions of Kheldar and 
Odin because they are both characters in a game.  I plan what they do 
using a set of precepts of how each views the game world AND using 
data points agreed on by the GM and the other players.

I had the character do those things.  But Chris's ability to run the

Actually what it does say is that the particle really does have ALL possible
masses until you can prove it doesn't.  This is a mind bending concept for
me and I have been wrestling with it for years with no success.  A more
relevant example is Schroedinger's Cat.

Modern physics says the following thing: Put a cat in a box with a vial of
poison gas that will be released when hit by a gamma ray and also put in the
box a radioactive isotope with a half-life of a thousand years.  Now close
the box.  It is impossible to predict (by the nature of radioactive decay)
when a gamma ray will be released.  Note that physics does not say we are
not smart enough to predict but that it is impossible to predict.  Quamtum
mechanics says that until you open the box the cat is BOTH alive and dead.
Both realities are simultaneously true and the quantum wave will not
collapse until an observer measures the resulting system by openning the
box.  It makes my brain hurt.

Note that physics examples never worry about things like the ASPCA or the

		The Heisenberg Principle states that you can only MEASURE

the

looks at

		Umm.. do not be so quick my friend.  Do you understand WHY
the Heisenberg Principle  says that?  That you cannot measure the location
AND the velocity of a ""particle"" at the same time?  I promise you a
conversation into Quantum Mechanics and Heisenberg's principle will break
your mind- because that world doesn't work by Newtonian ""cause-and-effect""
rules.  Observation DOES impact what happens.  Objects moving do NOT have to
cross the intervening space to get to point B from point A and time doesn't
necessarily move in any one direction.  As a matter of fact a particle CAN
have different masses depending on your relative observation framework.  

		You do not want to go down that path Chris- it will destroy
your conception of an orderly universe! :-)

		No you can't.  You can only know how it appears or, more
rigorously, how it occurs to your characters.    For a really simplistic,
small-scale but relevant example: I, as the GM, may tell you that the figure
on the street is a normal human beggar but he is actually Loki.  However you
may ask me Chris to Alex: ""Are we going to be able to go down the street
without incident?"" and I will say: ""Sure!""   Then right in front of Loki you
will whip out the Ultimate Ord of Freedom Binding and he will whip out
everything he has to steal it....   You only know what I tell you.  

		Now- that is not to drive you crazy!  That is just that I
will often share my ideas about the meta-physics and history of the world
with you but:
(1)	In a world of Chaos Magic and Disciplines it IS subject to change!
:-) 
(2)	It may be that I decide for plot betterment that I do not tell you
something or I tell you only what your character would know.
(3)	Sometimes I change the story if it is better that way and I can do
it without screwing up the players. 
(4)	 One CGB might be living in a variation of reality in which it has
been shaped influenced and operates out of a reality you do not share.
This is COMMON in the BT world.

Faerie, for instance operates out of multiple histories that it maintains-
all of which are true histories that sometimes contradict each other.  The
same person might even have different memories depending on which city they
are in or which chain of events they are involved in.   They might even have
scars form a battle with one group of friends and not with their fellow
students at the college- in which's history they were never in a battle!!!!
Is this confusing?  Yes!  Is it playable for everybody?  No.   Is it
interesting?  You bet!  

Now the Good news is that the Bridge of Dof-Sifrin really stabilized a lot
of this stuff.  When the Bridge breaks it will be back to Chaos for a lot of
things. 

Now just to handle your mind- there is an official current agreement
-reality time line.  It is the one on the web site.  This is more as a
convenience for us a s players in the Game so we can have a historical
conversation and because humans like linearity and temporality that is
causal- so whatever the current reality is they develop a past and a future
for it that is consistent.

might draw energy from the ball of elemental fire hanging 9,000,000 miles
away from the Earth.

hitting the crystal sphere that swings around mArs... :-) Just kidding- I
know that isn't the point.    Agreement reality in the individual model only
works if you have lots and LOTS of consensus realities stitched together.
The world now thinks you can fly through space and now we do.

You can use a 10 x 10 room and a wandering monster to avoid both the
starvation (monsters keep indefinitely in a 10 x 10 room) and the
ASPCA.  (Though there might be an ASPCM... )

What happens when two (or more) observers look into the box?  Do they
wrestle for Dominant Viewpoint, or do they just quietly work a deal
and agree on something?

If they tie, do we get a zombie cat?

So why can't the One True Nature of Reality be one of those things we
can't tell the difference about?

Or why can't you have Kheldar and ODIN go about gathering the evidence
you need for their (nefarious?) plots?

...And why should either of them give two figs about what -you- think
BT reality is?  Eman doesn't ask my opinions about BT physics when he
starts playing around with stuff.  Dullo -certainly- didn't ask me if
unbinding was the cleverest solution to his problem.  (Though I'll
admit I didn't think the dangers of such an act had been made
particularly clear to either of us, but that's another tale.)

Alex has gone out of his way to make the BT universe 'realistic'.  If
that includes muddying up the underlying nature of Reality, then I'm
okay with that.  If that means improvising wildly each time we start
poking at the foundations of the world and later trying to make it at
least appear consistent, I'm okay with that, too.

I'll leave the physics to Pookie.  I read too much SF to be good at
what is and isn't true at this stage of the world's history.  (Make
that this stage of -this- world's history.)

That's fine.  I'm agnostic myself.  (I lack the faith to be an
atheist, or any other kind of theist.)

But nothing about Reality is proven.  Our real one -or- Alex's
fictional one.

Some theories don't match the facts, so they are not clever choices to
base your life on.  Of the rest, some have undesirable consequences,
so you might want to skip them.  Any of the others can be something to
base your life on.

Except that Alex is telling us that we DON'T know.  Maybe he hasn't
decided yet.  Maybe he wants us to choose for ourselves.  Maybe he's
checking all our theories until he finds on that he likes better than
what he's been using.  I, personally, don't care.  There is a history
of Reality in BT, and several people/races have theories as to what it
all means.  If I need to do something about Reality, I will fond a
theory which works for me and does what I need, and put my
Reality-weight behind it.  Until then, I think I might as well be a
free agent.

If it is important to you, find out.  (It seems to be important to
you.)

It makes more sense to me that Kheldar or ODIN makes plans (or you
make plans for them, since they are fictional devices) based on what
they know.  If you want to spend hours plotting the most efficient way
to leverage their abilities to achieve wondrous goals, that's fine,
but one of the constraints we agree to when playing our characters is
to be aware of their limitations in knowledge, and make decisions as
they would, given whatever knowledge they possess.  (Unless
meta-considerations require otherwise.. party unity is an oft-cited
source of exceptions.)

PLAYER?  Not CHARACTER?  (yah, yah, I know.)

If you are a player planning for a character to shift the cycle of day
and night, then part of the plan should involve finding out what's
really going on.  Either you have to deal with a fiery chariot (to mix
my cosmologies) or a bunch of hydrogen.  If you do not know which it
is (if it is only one), then you are in a very poor place to start
your project.

Maybe there is something available to you in a history-shifted reality
that wasn't otherwise there?  I'm not saying it's a good (outside BT)
choice, but a history with reality shift would offer, for instance,
the possibility of others in the future.

...Or maybe you're just uncomfortable with your ancestors being a
bunch of stupid people.

It is less complex to say that my car's engine is a box holding a
speed elemental, rather than a complicated arrangement of pistons and
gears. It is less complex to say that time flows at the same rate
everywhere.  It is less complex to say that light is either a wave or
a particle, that maggots gestate spontaneously in raw meat, that
communists are all evil, that the economy is driven strictly from the
top, or that toads cause warts.  It is not always correct.  It is not
always determinable.

Yeah.. the research money spent on those giant suction cups alone...

If you spend several million dollars on a space mission and don't even
look to see what's out there, you've got more problems than just the
taxpayers.

If you can't tell, it doesn't matter.  If it matters, find out.

If you still can't tell, then assume it's whatever one you want, and
stop worrying.

Um, to make it fun?  Multiple civilizations is administratively
complex.  So is history.  So are multiple pantheons, different planes,
various political forces, the odd Dorian invasion, more than four
characters, magic, non-human races, and a host of other things.

Alex LIKES administrative complexity.  (Witness the PRAC meetings, or
the BT combat system.)  This process provides endless hours of
amusement to him, and a rich, complex background for our (equally
rich) characters.

But there is no easy way to distinguish a personal-universe
flapping-flyer from a same-universe madman.  I would think that if one
of us can flap and fly, and the other one can't, it might be evidence
that (a) the universe means different things to us, (b) comic-book
physics is more common than I thought, or (c) we might not strictly be
in the same universe.

What happened to the agnostic?  Doesn't that leave NOBODY knowing what
IS?  (Well, at least nobody we can PROVE.)  Sorry.  Couldn't resist.
Now, back to our regular programming.

As a part-time GM (one slow email game, one/half monthly Amber game),
there are a couple of good reasons right off:

1. Real life is complex.  A simple game-life is harder to suspend
disbelief for.

2. Wiggle room.  Anything not already defined is available for change
to help a plot, the story, or a character.

3. How the heck are we supposed to define Reality in sufficient detail
when we have no clue as to what it really might be?  I have great
respect for Alex, but I don't suspect him of holding out on us about
having the Secrets to Reality.

4. Stories need to expand in scope over time.  One of the common
sub-plots, especially for wizards and mystics, is the unfolding nature
of Reality, with more and more details available as the character
gains in knowledge or wisdom.  BT is not a pinball game, with all the
rules laid out for us.  Part of the game is finding out what rules
govern our characters (and which of them can be broken...)

Fine.  You have your data points.  They come with sources and
reliability indices.

(Much like the data points software producers put out for system
requirements.)

I'd suggest a limited program of experimentation, to test your
hypotheses before subjecting large portions of the world to them.

None of us are rated on how efficiently we run our characters.  We are
rated on what they accomplish, and how stylishly we play them.

Besides, you've worked your way up from a drunken old fool to the
major god of a known religion -and- his high priest.  I'd say you're
not doing too bad. Heck, you even have a clean robe these days.

Yes, my fellow physics major, I do understand.  Cause-and-effect does 
apply.  Observation impacts what happens - but only because the 
methods of observation at our disposal utilize energy that is 
sufficiently large to affect the particle being observed.

Well, you have me there.  But then again, those are rules for the 
sub-atomic framework.  If you operate in the molecular framework, you 
operate within the rules that we have been discussing.

Hardly.  The rules that we use are approximations of physical laws. 
But just because we don't yet understand those physical laws doesn't 
mean that they don't exist.  Remember, I have no problem with flight 
by arm flapping - as long as you can show me.

I didn't say that we DO know everything in the game world, only that 
we CAN.  I absolutely understand the need to keep back certain 
information from the players.  But you withhold information at your 
discretion, for the entertainment of your players.  Where it is not 
critical for our entertainment, however, it is your option to let us 
in on or let us agree on the ""facts"".  You've always seemed quite 
content with having us do some of the creative work.

I said: What a few people believe doesn't change what IS.  Jim said 
""for sufficiently small values of 'few'.  And for sufficiently 
physical definitions of 'IS'.""  It doesn't matter if 30,000 people 
believe that the Sun revolves around the earth.  It doesn't (not in

rule in our world.

People keep missing my point.  I like and can handle the fluidity of 
reality in the game world.  When there is a reality shift, I shift 
gears.  My character may or may not be able to do that.  I don't like 
having non-consistent information between the players, though.  I 
don't care if my character doesn't know what is going on, but I want 
to know.

But that is precisely my point!  I have not yet heard of such a think 
happening in this, the REAL WORLD.  Line all the theories up that you 
want.  Data in this Reality says that in the previous example the 3 
Billion will die.  If they don't, then I will believe that whatever 
came out of the container wasn't nerve gas before I will believe that 
3 billion were immune and I was not.

You lost me.  What does that have to do with the fact that we, the 
players, CAN know what the result is of the game world's belief ???? 
All of us sit around the table, the reality shift happens, you COULD 
tell us what just happened, what the state of the game world is for 
each character..  One character may be in a reality wall that makes 
the ""world"" different, but all of the PLAYERS know.  THE PLAYERS can 
all make notes, all discuss the situation, all enter facts into a 
database, all refer back to the event 6 months from now, ""Yes, 
Mordanith thinks that the sky is Blue and Kheldar thinks that the sky 
is green""

But if WE CAN'T AGREE ON THE DATA POINTS THEN I CAN'T PLAN!  If Jim 
JM disputes that ODIN is what I say that he is and doesn't make it 
clear that he is talking as Mordanith rather than as Jim, I don't 
know whether I have written my notes down incorrectly about the data 
points or that Jim is answering as his character and is making his 
character perceive reality differently for game reasons.

They may be complex systems but as long as they are unnecessary 
complex systems, we spend more time than we need to which is an 
inefficient method.

It can be.  In that situation, why add complexity where it isn't 
necessary?   Go for the simplest solution that describes the 
situation.

We were talking about the real world, so I'm not sure what you are 
saying here about Odin and
Kheldar.  I'm going to interpret.  Please correct me if I am 
interpreting your meaning incorrectly

If you are saying, ""why can't CHRIS have Kheldar and Odin go about 
gathering the GAME WORLD DATA that CHRIS needs for the CHARACTERS 
actions?"" then the answer is: We average a game every few months.  In 
FIFTEEN Real World years, we've only moved forward TWO Game Years. 
And we are playing in a campaign where the characters measure time in 
Epochs!

If the information that CHRIS needs to decide what actions he is 
going to give to Kheldar and Odin is available from someone at the 
game table, I don't want to have to spend real years going after that 
information.  It isn't that I have anything better to do with my 
time, it is that Alex does.  I don't for a minute think that I am the 
only one that is in this situation, but do you have any idea how many 
email messages I have sent to Alex which have never been returned?  I 
can't tell you exactly but the answer is less than a hundred and well 
over fifty.

This game is like heroin to me.  90% of the time I hate it.  The 
other 10% of the time it is the best thing that I have ever 
experienced and I'd give almost anything to experience that HIGH - 
even deal with the 90% that is shit.

Whoa.  You really lost me there.  I know that you don't think that 
the characters have any true existence, so I must be missing your

Like I said above, I like it too, but only when we play often enough 
that it doesn't get in the way.  When we play infrequently it is more

Chris has been trying to find out pieces of game information for 
years.  People that play Monopoly expect to PASS Go and collect $200 
on a fairly regular basis.

Two points here.
FIrst, Kheldar and even more so, Odin, have more facts at their 
disposal than Alex has time to give me.

Second, I can derive some additional satisfaction from the game, 
beyond what my characters experience, if I (Chris) know what else is 
happening in the game world.  What is Peter's character doing?  What 
is Kay doing?  What is Dora doing?   What is Vartigan doing?  I 
rarely find out these things because they are ""a game secret"", 
""effect a current character's scenario"", or ""I don't want to tell any 
other Players because it might leak out to the characters"".  And what 
is the net effect of this on how I play?  I have to get my jollies by 
trying to surprise all of you with things.

See my point above about Play time.  It takes too long to ferret out 
REAL data (as opposed to Alex saying, ""OK, your character knows 
enough for you to get a +200% on his rolls"")  What I want is REAL 
data to allow me to run through scenarios in the dead time between 
games.  Personally, I wouldn't care if the character spent a hundred 
years doing research, as long as I could role play on a regular basis.

This was a real world example.  What we're saying here is that the 
only reason for you to posit a more complex theory of reality is 
because you are ashamed of your past.  Be Serious.

But it isn't true!  I guarantee you that if you take any person not

in, they will not see an elemental.  I have a hundred dollars that 
I'm willing to lay on the table right now if you want to take that

You did not hear me correctly.  What I've said is that Occam's Razor 
is the least complex solution that explains all of the parameters of 
the situation.  Some of the examples that you have given are more 
simple, but they don't handle the parameters.

Administratively complex is all of us having our own versions of 
history and not being able to rely on our notes for WHAT IS when we 
need to act on something because maybe it isn't anymore (or never was 
because your character was misinformed)  I know you guys think that 
kind of thing is fun, but I don't.
Multiple civilizations, pantheons, planes, political forces - all 
those things ARE fun.  But not knowing which of your notes that you 
took over a ten year period are accurate - that isn't fun at all.

We're talking about two kinds of Administrative complexity.  I like 
the complexity of a rich game environment.  I don't like having seven 
different answers for the same question.  I'm not given enough game 
time to both figure out which one is accurate and accomplish what I 
want my character to accomplish.

Agnostics don't disbelieve in GOD, they simply reserve judgement

A game that is too complex is not as much fun to play.  There was a 
computer game that I had once.  It was called ""Quake Minus One"". 
Every person that I ever had over to play the game died within the 
first thirty seconds.  I finally called the manufacturer and asked if 
the creator was able to complete the game.  The tech said, ""Not Yet, 
but he is still working on it""  I haven't played the game since.

I'm not talking about rating, I'm talking about the amount of time

plenty to handle large enchantments and be able to use the Air pattern.  Jim

    As I mentioned in the previous messages, I was thinking more on the

what we'll need to do is to be able to create 10-20 permanent items weighing
approximately 1000-1500 tons.  They'll need to be able to go up and down and
travel from one side of the continent to the other at a speed at least 5

Um, I'm gonna be real bad on this one.  For the record, my take on it is
that Kheldar and (BT)Odin are part of the real world (the common reality
that includes such wonders as email and all of us) as fictional characters
portrays by one of us.

[Me again, about BT reality]

I think all of us (players) are doing that in our own fashion.  You seem to
be objecting to the fact that some of us are coming up with significantly
different answers, none of which can easily be proved 'wrong'.  And that the
characters acting on these differing beliefs are all succeeding in their
various ways.

Shrug.

The underlying BT reality is, at the moment, unknowable to mortal mind.  And
others, as well, unless the pointy-eared mage types get some sort of special
dispensation I don't know about.  (These are character minds, for the
record.)  All of us (characters) are working with approximations, based on
our cultural backgrounds, our training, and our experience.  (What we were
told, and what we have seen.)  All of us players are (to the degree we worry
about it at all) using guesses that seem in-character for our characters,
based on what Alex has told us, or told others while we were there.  Some
players think that the approximation their character is using may be
incomplete or incorrect in several major areas.

So, we find the simplest solution that describes the situation.  All of us
(players and characters) with differing ideas as to what 'simple' consists
of, and having different descriptions of the situation.  (Due to Alex
providing us with them, to cover different character biases, perceptions,
and expertises.  Due to human-level player memories lending some
descriptions more weight than others.  Due to underlying BT reality evolving
as Alex's thinking on the matter becomes more developed. Lotsa factors.)

[Still on BT reality]
ODIN has a church.  Kheldar is a (rogue) member.  Kheldar is a member of the
Ring, the Grey Wanderers, the Five, and the Mages' Guild, as well as having
his pick of the loot from the Battle of Gazed-Lah, a spare monastery or two,
a personal Fortu advisor, and a private Machine.

They have resources for research.

Research need not take place in game time.

If you think they should know some of this already, you can ask Alex.
(Though email -does- seem to have a poor response time.)  I have found
simple questions work better with him than long, detailed ones.

Okay.  In -my- reality, Eman and Dullo are fictional characters, portrayed
by me in a setting generated by Alex, which sometimes incorporates sections
suggested by other people.

In order to portray them well and enjoyably, I maintain a fictional reality
in which they, and their setting are real (though Dullo is real dead).
While playing the characters, or making decisions for them, I usually
pretend that they, and their reality, are real, and are separate people from
myself and my radically-different worldview.  I never pretend that these
fictional characters consult me for any of their decisions.  Clearer?

Well, then we can either play more frequently, or stop poking around with
the foundations of (BT) Reality.

No assuming Godhood.  No rewriting history and laws of physics.  No time
travel.  No Discipline magics.  No summoning people from the Void.  No
un-Pegging.  No Time Hammer, no Bolt of Damnation.  No travel to the Bridge
and beyond. No messing with ancient gods and artifacts.  And probably no
lich-bits.

No fun.

[Myth, both again]
???

Isn't this what you were complaining about?  Or is it that some of the
'proven' things are, from someone else's viewpoint, false?

[BT]
That is part of the setup of Alex's world.  It is not unique.  Go with the
'proven' things.  If you think it may blow up, check your numbers.

[Our world]
People are like that.  If it bothers you, have them demonstrate.  Without
proof to the contrary, either story can be equally valid.

[Chris]
> Who is ""I""  E-Man or Myth?

[Myth, 'real' world]
I, as a player, don't care what the underlying nature of BT reality is.  I
have a theory or two, based on the evidence I've seen, but would be
perfectly delighted to find it all based on a misunderstanding.  (Not that
I'm eager for that, Alex...)

'I', as Eman, believe 'I' know what Reality is.  I, as a player assume that
his viewpoint is the basic Dorian one, modified by training and some rather
extraordinary experiences.

I, as a person, have no clue what the underlying nature of Reality might be,
and have a certain caution against poking it with metaphorical sharp sticks.
I use a fairly standard material-scientific model, with some areas open to
question.  I would be rather startled to find it all based on a
misunderstanding, but like to think that I would adjust.

[Myth, real]
Ultimate BT Secrets (tm) are one of the higher-powered rewards Alex has for
us as players.

If you like a Monopoly metaphor, passing Go would, I think, be the
equivalent of getting EP rolls.  That happens on a regular basis (at least,
compared to our run frequency).  I think you are looking for the equivalent
of an NPC landing on that lovely hotel you have on Boardwalk.

I doubt Alex will pass these things out without in-game justification,
out-of-game reminders, and sufficient time and effort (in and out of game)
spent on the task.  If you need to know what is required for the knowledge,
you should ask him.

[Myth, same]
Yup.  Believe it or not, I don't know how to make rugs, let alone flying
ones.  I suspect Jim EW lacks an encyclopedic knowledge of rune systems.
I'm fairly positive Jim JM is not expert in multidimensional practical
mathematics.

Alex will not give you all the facts your character has access to.  That
would take more time than we have, even assuming no non-gaming activity and
fantastic health care.  Instead, he has given me vague outlines of what Eman
knows, and graciously answers quick yes-no questions about specifics, should
I need them.  (Admittedly, some of those answers are ""You don't know"", but
still..)

[Myth, Real]
That's fine, Chris.  However, Alex's prime goal is not ""Let Chris surprise
the other players"", and my goals are not ""Get surprised by Chris"".

As far as I know, the basic goal is ""Tell a good story"".  (Alex, please
correct me if I've misstated things.)  Things are set up to support that,
and other goals (acquire power, get Eman laid, whatever) have to work within
that framework.

[Myth, Real]
That's a LOT of data.  How is Alex supposed to find time to convey the
equivalent of an advanced degree in quantum physics to you, on behalf of a
fictional character?

You might want to ask for the review of the summary of the Cliff Notes,
instead.

[Myth]
1. I am not saying it's the only reason.  I'm offering it as A reason,
albeit a silly one.
2. I am saying that a simple-though-restrictive Reality-story  might be less
desirable than a more-complicated-but-useful one.  (Usual dangers of
theory-making apply: theory should fit observed data, predict new reliably.)
Simplicity is not the sole determiner of validity, just a good tie-breaker.

[Chris, Real]

[Myth, Real]
Okay.  Myth's Guide to Coping With Realities

1. If you can't tell, then it doesn't matter.

A difference that makes no different is not difference.  I, personally, have
no data that the sun is not a huge fire elemental.  If it were, my current
life would be exactly the same.  (Ignoring, for the moment, possible magical
spin-offs of such a thing.)

2. If it matters, learn how to tell.

If I were a scientist preparing a solar probe, I might well be interested in
determining the nature of the Sun, so that I might design for that
environment.  I would examine rival theories, construct tests, and do other
deterministic stuff.

3. If you still can't tell, pick one.

As a scientist, my solar theories have devolved to two which fit the
observed data; fire elemental and fusing hydrogen plasma.  If there is no
way to tell the difference between them, based on carefully-observed data,
then (for your purposes) it makes no difference which is 'true'.

Hmm indeed.  Tis a puzzlement, to quote Yul Brynner.

that is simple, straightforward, and brief.  On the other hand, it has
to be an intelligent question, and show that we are willing to work.

""How can we get the rest of the Lich bits?""

""Which places should we visit and in what order to recover the rest of
the lich bits with the highest cumulative chance of success?""


I'm not sure always knowing the location of the pieces would help us.
Given their proof-ness against divination, there might be some hefty
side-effects from one of us becoming something that could sense them.
Also, there is Balance to consider-- I don't know whether or not the
Fates are Balanced, but I'd hate for the Other Side (tm) to sacrifice
one of their remaining doppelgangers just to earn an equal boon.  The
more of this we can do with our own resources, the better off the
strategic situation is.  (OTOH, the Fates are a fairly unique resource
themselves... )

Just some thoughts.

"RE: Question","Often times the most important thing about asking a question is a clear
statement of what it is you want to know.  I am a little fuzzy on what we
are trying to maximize.  The more specific we can be the more succesful we
are likely to be.  In some ways it strikes me as more of a question of what
do we want than what should we ask.

For example:

We could be trying to find a question that will let us locate all of the
liche bits whenever we want, individually or one right after another,
ourselves or someone we delegate with minimum danger to ourselves, maximum
chance of success and minimum possibility of gain by The Other Side (tm).
Also the question should not in anyway compromise any of the liche bits that
are already under our control at the time that we want them even though I am
not sure I could define ""under our control"" or ""the time we want them"" very
well.

Do we need all of this?  Perhaps we are making ourselves to central to this.
Would it work to ask:

What actions will be required (by us) to ensure that all of the Liche bits
can be combined to kill the liche within 5 years time

-or-

What actions (by us) will be maximize the probability that all of the Liche
bits can be combined to kill the liche within 5 years time

(The first one could return 5000 actions, any 5 of which would work in the
right combination - the latter returns the specific combination of actions
with the highest probability)

A more Strategy Fortu like question might be ""Produce a contingency tree
with less than 1024 nodes composed only of actions by us and observations by
us which will maximize the possibility of the Liche being destroyed in five
years""

A disadvantage of a question like this is that it requires you to open up
completely to the Fates so that they can assess you accurately.  Of course
the whole premise of this working is that they are omniscient enough that
this is probably not necessary.

Another interesting question raised by the preceding is exactly what do we
mean by killing the Liche?  What is the effect we are looking for?  Liche be
not'd?  Certainly not Liche becoming a creature of death.  Liche banished
beyond the Bifrost?  Asmonar banished beyond the Bifrost?  All death
eradicated everywhere?

Is the Liche an avatar of Asmonar?

Strategy-Mode-Sigmund will think about it a little more once somebody puts
his brain back together.  Oy, I need about 4 bushels of aspirin.  If a human
puts a steak on their eye when they get a black eye what does a Fortu do?

"RE: Shifters Run","Well, I can make it but unfortunately only if it is at our house and only
until about 4:00.  Andrea, Ben and I will be going out after that.  If Rita
is interested Andrea had invited her to come over and hang out with her  and
comiserate if Britt wanted to game and still have the two of you in the same
location.  This of course may be a far less feasible plan this week than
last week.

Anyway, that is the scoop for me.

Alex & Chris, we should set up a few basics for any Sigmund repairing so
that it does not dominate the run.  Chris, did you have a plan?  I would be
perfectly happy to suggest a plan from the perspective of D'Jan and Peter
but I think it would involve getting me to my lab in Marden, stabilizing me
and then calling Kheldar so Chris's plan may be more relevant.

Resources that I have at my Marden lab (if Alex approves - I have not really
described this before):
  a.. A number of crystal gardens (growing rooms) far more extensive than
any of the ones I planned at Ward 1 or Ward 2.  These are early gardens but
should have a complete assortment of utility crystals.  Anything specialized
would have to be custom grown so the stock of specialized crystals may not
be as mature as at these other two locations.
  b.. A statis chamber for storing things in a time stopped state.
  c.. A general diagnostics processor with an advanced but partially
completed user interface (appears as 4 squat colored crystal zigaruts about
4' high with a lot of fibers connecting and leaving them.  When activated
any number of floating translucent information panels can be created and
display runes and graphical data).
  d.. Connected to these processors is a small set of sensors (this is the
area where the other locations are probably much more sophisticated since I
have not had time to develop it and this may have been more related to other
peoples specialities).  Most of the sensors are focused around a lab table
(designed for examining Fortu).
  e.. A consecrated shrine to the divine Fortu containing representations of
the Sword, the Rod and the Seed.  This shrine is linked into the sensor net
although very loosely intergrated at the moment.  Theoretically the altar
has control priveleges as well as being configured as a sensor.  Also,
theoretically while working on me the actual sword and rod could be used on
the altar which should increase its potency.
  f.. The lab is completely warded and isolated both using traditional wards
and discipline shields.
  g.. Shielded storage rooms containing a wide variety of standard material
components that would be of use to a Drawing mage (conincidentally these
material components seem to always have long shelf lives - permanence is a
defining characteristic of the Kua-Toa).
  h.. Despite all the stuff I mentioned here the lab is very spacious and
there is a lot of room obviously intended for other equipment not yet
installed.
Also possibly of use and located in the club:
  a.. The birthing room - a large heavily shielded room specifically
designed for incubating growing Fortu while in the egg state (I am believing
that construction had started at the underground levels and is now
progressed to the point where we are working on above ground structures -
this may not be exactly true).
  b.. Shielded and locked gates that go to the general area of the Library
and Kheldars Mansion (although neither gate goes to directly to a Ward).
  c.. Both Grallar and Gallek are hanging out in the lab at this moment.
  d.. There is a mage school near by.
  e.. We are near a lot of node line power (I believe) but the lab is
specifically isolated from it.

  Well, I can't really say I'm going to make it and I can't say I'm not
going to make it.   We're now past the due date and waiting, so even if
nothing happens by Saturday I'd really rather not be to far away in case it
does.  So, plan on running without me, I don't think I'd be much help in
Sigmund repair anyway.

    Aooga!  Aooga!

    Emergency reschedule!


    Hi, All.

    I have cleared Saturday, Feb 5, with Alex.  It is now reserved for
Shifters' use.

    Can we all take advantage of this?


    If not a full run, perhaps we could work a Sigmund repair-party?

"Gaming","Just a quick summary of things Sigmund has and does not have after the excellant repair job performed on him.

Works fine
Hearing and vocalization (but not spoken language comprehension and speaking)
Dexterity and agility
Physical toughness and health
Writing and reading (including spoken language comprehension)
Fortlan communication
Battlecode communication
Conceptual thinking
Understanding of magic and physical laws
My excellant sense of humor and witty reparte
Local net connections (line of sight)
Claw mode (I assume rune drawing would work*)
Physical skills like sword

Would probably work but advised against trying
Dreamwalking
KI Factor shape shifting
Any KI based willworkings (change size, heal,...)
Sorceries*

Might work but am denied permission to execute/facility does not register
Run self-diagnostics
Speed/Stealth/Transverse
Global net connection (to big brother, local worked fine)

Appears damaged
Speech and spoken language comprehension
Connection to divine abilities (?)
Vision (including all extra senses - work fine but I see things that others do not - I suspect this is a purely problem in ""trying to not see things that are not there"" rather than a problem in seeing things that are there).
Memory (no history - no idea who anyone is - I am slowly relearning everything)

Don't know
Drawing wizardries* (I assume they would need to be retuned as per the disad of the school)
Discipline magics* (Yeah I know it would be a bad idea but I don't know if it would be possible)
Elvish Earthsinging*
actually I am really not sure what the final statement on my use of divine abilities was (after I was off the table)

*The things marked with an asterisk could not really be verified till I get out of Warrior mode anyway (which is contraindicated at the moment).  One disad of warrior form is that it is impossible for me to manipulate mana.  Normally this does not prevent me from using KI or Divine abilities but does prevent me from using all SCF.

Can't think of anything else relevant

I am currently communicating through a crystal on my throat (that D'Jan and Peter wipped up in the lab) that knows a smattering of common languages (incuding Dorian and Marin) enough to convert spoken word to and from written word and pump the info directly into my (working) writing centers rather than my (busted) speech centers.  When I talk I write with my finger in the air.  When I hear my eyes probably scan back and forth as if I were reading the text (do I have pupils? are they just carved lines on the orb of my eye?)

For the next run at least I am going to be purely a fighter.  It seems to be the part thats not busted and I am in the right form for it.  Some people may think I will be lost without my speed, stealth and transverse but I am a pretty damned kick ass fighter and I think I will do fine anyway.  Someone will have to remind me not to trust the death knights however.

"RE: Gaming","It is Eman's opinion that Sigmund's speech comprehension (and
comprehensibility) will return fairly quickly over time, as he
rebuilds the patterns correlating sound with words.

He strongly advises against anything that changes your relationship
with the (meta)physical world (stealth, slippery, planeshifting,
disciplines) until you are more comfortable operating in the default
universe.  He suspects a number of your routines are recalibrating
themselves (like your speech centers), and Bad Things will happen if
you confuse them too much during this stage.  Allow your base pattern
to dominate your physical form, and return it to compliance.

                                                       -Eman,
Pattern-Doctor.

ps-- anyone know where I could get good training in Enchantment?  From
someone I can trust -before- the first lesson?

"The Club","Well, as I could not sleep and consequently had too much time on my hands
last night I finished off the map of the adventurers club and even described
some of the first two floors.

I added this to my Bardic Tales web site under a new section for player
resources.  If anybody else wants to host some player/character specific
information here I would be happy to put it up.

I have included a special room in the club with a tailored environment for
each of the characters in shifters except Kheldar.  I would have included
one for you but you do not seem to not have a strong elemental affinity
other than earth and I am just not sure what an earth environment would look
like.  Also the main hall on the lower level is sort of dwarven/terethi in
character so I don't think i need a special environment for him.

Anyway, any comments you have would be greatly appreciated.  I have not yet
included a designation as to which parts are already built and which are
still under construction.  Obviously I could dump a huge amount of time into
describing the design if I let myself.

Also, Kalarina has been helping a lot with the water zone and Mordenaith had
agreed to help out with some of the wards but if anyone else would like to
pitch in you are always welcome.  I still need to hold a grand openning
party some time soon.

A few tricky design issues I have not yet resolved:

1.  I would like a good 'bouncer' ward to help prevent fights.  One of the
visions of the club is to serve an extremely diverse set of high level
adventurers including people who might be enemies of each other.  I was
originally considering a non-violence-pact ward that you had to agree to
when you entered the club but then I realized that Arak would not be able to
use the club.  I am now thinking of designing a bouncability ward.
Essentially this would require you agree that while you are in the club,
club personal can force you to leave at any time and for any reason
(presumably only for breaking the rules but interpretation is up to us) and
the ward will make it very easy for us to eject the offender and hard for
them to resist ejection.  That way Arak does not need to promise to be
non-violent.  Any better ideas?

2. I am not sure how to structure membership.  At the moment I am thinking
along the lines of must be sponsored by an existing member and club staff
has the right to deny or revoke membership at any time (membership must be
ratified by club staff before it is considered effective).  I would like to
set up the club as a place where high-level NPCs would naturally come when
they want to socialize or meet other high-level NPCs.  What are good ways to
encourage this?  So far I am working on diverse & personalized environments,
good food and drink and entertainment.  I need a good PR strategy though.

3. I think it is important to a club like this to be strongly DIV warded.
Also, it seems that to be a big building in Marden it is a good idea to be
kind of durable.  Beyond this what other kinds of wards do you think I need?
I am thinking of a teleport trap ward just to force people to use the front
doors (and to cut down on assasins).

Anyway, feel free to send me suggestions.

Chris and Britts e-mail addresses at home.

What happened the last time we got together:

We finally decided to take care of a nagging thorn that had been in our side
for a few years.  Altzar, the Demon lord of Possession, had possessed
Morphus once and given us some serious trouble.  More by luck than skill, we
bypassed his threat by convincing him to pass his will into a few coins that
were then going to be given to Mordanith.  Mordanith did not oblige,
however.  Ever since then, he has been had been trying to get us.  He had
set up some teleport traps that would bring us to him if we teleported
through the area centered on the gate where we last interacted with him.

We did some research and learned that Altzar lives in the 4th Plane of the
Abyss; he is a bifurcated demon; He has taken his essence and locked it
somewhere on the 4th Plane.  Demons of his type are sensitive to Lead.  With
the help of the Master Summoner of Marden (Aelvien), we hoped to lock him on
this plane while we sought his essence and destroyed it.

Kilsorana casts a Mind Shield on Kheldar and links it to me as if I cast it
(10 end/hour) 60 point base.

Kheldar to DJon: {Go to the Monastery; take Sigmunds rod; enlist any
monastery mages that you think necessary.
Watch me through the ballet mirror (elevated view). When I signal you to
Bring me through have an Enchanter use my halite to determine if I am
possessed.  If not, zoom in on me, put your hand through the mirror and draw
me back.  If we have to go through the gate, keep watch on those who remain
to guard Altzar.  Pull my carpet bag through if it looks like it is at
risk.}

The party consisted of Kheldar, Mordanith, Erithmaen, Kilsorana, Sigmund,
Khalid, Arak, and Kor-Keth the Fortu.  The Master Summoner brought along two
sentinels and four (big) lizard-men (with tulwars and studded leather
armor).

We go to Sigmunds club.  I planar travel to the other side of the wall that
secures Sigmunds hard gate to the Paths of the Dead.  We travel and
encounter a 20 wide hole that seems to be Lich flavored.  We pass a 2x3
bound box.  We pass a priest of Usul.  He asks if weve seen a box (we
tell him).  Our destination is the ruined city of Koreth, 100 yards outside
of the library.  When we arrive we see signs of activity at the
archeological dig and a campfire some distance away.  We walk the rest of
the way.  We left most of our loud magic items behind so that we would
have a better chance at surprising him.

{I brought Orb of Souls, Kheldar as dagger; Discipline Sword (100 pt matter
blasts); Staff of Order.  Left most of my items behind or in my carpetbag:
Staff, Soul Collector, KIF focus, Halite Dodecahedron, ring, statue of
Sleipnir}

We set up for our casting.  A containment ward around the gate.  An
un-activated defensive ward within the containment ward.  Summoning circle
within the defensive ward.  Bands of Samara within the Summoning circle.  A
Defensive Ward around the casters.

Kor-Keth sites a Servant of No-Rennan walking towards us.  Arak kills him
through his eye with a crossbow bolt.  I detect that his holy symbol, a
domino(divination) in his pouch, and a pouch full of gold dust (evocation
and fire) are magical.  I isolate these three items with an anti-div circle.
Another human comes through the gate and Arak kills him.

Bands of Samara: (Warder): using Ruby dust

Babboons are attacking, lizard things are trying to get through the gate,
and Altzar has possessed Kilsorana.

End of 12-9-2000 run
Run of 4-22-2001 begins

The Master Summoner succeeds with binding Altzar (Kilsorana)

It is decided that Khalid, Arak, Kor-Keth, Kheldar, & E-Man will retrieve
the essence.  Kheldar signals DJon and DJon pulls us through to a room.
It appears that we have just walked through a ballet mirror (long ceiling
high mirror with a bar running horizontally across the center.)   The mirror
shows where the group was last standing.  I say Show us the essence of
Altzar that is on the 4th Plane of the Abyss.  I am using the Staff of
Order to reinforce the mirrors integrity and that of the portal.  I roll to
determine if the focus is diverted by a phoenix.  Succeeding, we see an
escarpment leading to a well and guarded by two statues.

Kor-Keth goes through stealthed for reconnaissance.  We can see him with an
effort.  When he turns around he unfolds and sets a shield in front of him,
then a sword.  Arak is immediately tense.  We ask and he says that Kor-Keth
must see something above the gate that he believes will attach as soon as he
unstealths and warns us.  He unstealths, and uses battle code to tell us
there are two dragons above the mirror gate.  Dragon fire immediately fills
our view.  When it stops, the sword is a puddle, the shield is glowing red
and Kor-Keth makes it back just in time to shut down.  We immediately
realize that we need more fire power and re-focus the mirror on the rest of
the party.  We give Kor-keth to Sigmund and he is taken to Sigmunds club
for repair.

The Master Summoner says that Amburdus the Mad (Dorian Mage) says that the
Guardians at the Well are bound Slaad.  Dont break them up.

I send Mordanith to the Grove site to do the prep work for his Plane Bore
spell.  Labelas says that he has to do the prep work on the Abyss (Darn!).
I recommend that he do it at the Citadel of the Seven Towers.  He does.  I
focus on Nygolds tower, peg a frog-thing, touch Mordanith with the location
wand and close the mirror.  I bring back Arak and he a few minutes later.

I try to open the mirror on the Abyss again but the Phoenix intercepts.  I
take ten points of damage after a will battle and then close the mirror.  I
get the points back with a potion from Mordanith.

I suggest a diversion.  Mordanith is going to teleport a Bolt of Damnation
trigger covered with our aura, counting on Altzars traps to teleport it to
the Abyss.  Hopefully it will help to divert the Phoenix.  Extremely
hopefully it will trigger the teleport trap.

It does divert the phoenix but we dont know what to do.  We make plans to
Bolt the vessel, and then suck the soul.  DJon goes through to do initial
recon and indicates that the dragons are gone.  The statues immediately
begin to follow him.  He leads them away.  I shift the perspective of our
view and step through the mirror.  Holding the Staff of Order behind me I
launch the Bolt of Damnation that I have prepared and several things happen.
The whole escarpment is a trapped illusion; it dissolves (except for a small
circle around the Staff of Order.)  There are multiple levels of wards in
the well and a reality wall.  The container is a Slaad but the Bolt destroys
it and the wards around it.  I immediately make a will power save and then
attempt to absorb the soul.  Extreme Deific attention is now focused on this
location.

An ancient, large dragon with two heads (1st generation daughter of Kisereth
or manifestation of Kisereth) appears above DJon and is getting ready to
breath fire.  DJon is running for the shield.  The Slaads are headed for
me.  A 40th circle mage (where did he come from?) has just opened a rift to
summon No-Rennon.  A phoenix is approaching.

Kheldar takes Altzars soul and steps backward through the mirror.  The
focus shifts with the essence, effectively isolating the others.  I attempt
to focus on the others but (sorry, forgot exactly what happened here).  I
decide that the rest of the party wont make it back without help.  Odin
rides through on Sleipnir.  He has the spool in addition to the Staff of
Law and Soultaker.

This has drawbacks.  Practically the entire Abyss is focused on the biggest
source of Order that has ever been in the Abyss.  No-Rennan sends tendrils
towards Odin immediately.  Odin uses the spool to draw the others through
the mirror with him (dont ask.).  We then focus on the steps of the temple
of Corellan in Marden.  Odin asks for permission to enter.  This is denied
but Kheldar is given leave to enter.  Odin enters, shifts and follows
Mordanith.  They walk the path to Fairy.

All of us are asked to leave behind holy symbols and related Deific items.
I leave the staff (and sword) behind.  We go to meet Labelas.  We give
Altzar to him.  He asks if we wish a boon.  Britt suggests that we ask for
Kilsorana to be restored.  She is.  Lots of elves want to talk with
Mordanith.  I speak with one about Kheldar, Odin and the spool.  We go back
to Marden.  (OK, Im tired of typing.  There was a little more here).

100 eeps for this run
50 eeps each for the last three runs if we are fairly certain that we didnt
get them already.
