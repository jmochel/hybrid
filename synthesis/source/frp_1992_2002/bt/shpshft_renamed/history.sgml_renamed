        I meet with the elderly mage who calls himself &Mrp . We are
        joined by a older human who calls himself Zacalatar of the Bright One .
        He inquires as to whether we are mages and what we are planning. He
        claims that the Bright One is a patron of mages. Later it was disclosed
        to &Mrd that the person was a cleric of Loki. We are recruited by a Bengali
        mercenary to help as guards for a caravan to excavate a forbidden city
        and when we meet with a human about the jobs &Mrp is challenged to prove
        that he is a mage. &Mrp blows a brazier to kingdom come and we are asked

        Dwarf with a 80 point Psi Blast. The dwarf staggers and attacks &Mrd . &Mrd
        dodges but is also attacked by several of the dwarves' companions. &Mrd
        survives, thanks in great part to his companions and a critical matter
        blast against the axe handle of one the his attackers. The blast
        vaporizes the haft of the axe.

        There, we will talk with the priest and then investigate the rumor that

        up one of the dwarves axe handles. They either die or scatter. The dwarf

my creation (and summon water). They flower (birch has golden leaves)
temperature lowers. &Mrd has opened a door to faery. I have planted in
faery. I reclaim three twigs. Mage trance, setup, wizardry. Hold tree
magic back, a small spring appears at each tree. I link with &Sig and
ask him to wait. &Sig accesses the power the Linking Ward of Nureyev was
</para>

<para> created with. &Mrd's father casts a spell and the trees grow more
rapidly. &Dul regains shape but leaves most of the bush behind. A
shooting star impacts, &Sig channels to me and the excess to his power
source (sink?), space enclosed with rock. He deactivates, but I shape
twice and bind it to the rock that &Sig threw into the Faery area. I
change it into a crystalline form. ( it glows and the trees don't want
to be anywhere near the fire energy.) 7 hours go by.
</para>

<para> Another fire ball approaches. I setup for a shape of fire to
light. I do so but fail to channel it to the tree. Good thing, because
it takes only a portion of a potential overdose.
</para>

<para> All three trees now have the same growth amount. The stone is
glowing brighter, its form more compact. I have used a lot of spell
points. I feel that I am currently at 15 spell points. I drop into mage
trance and telepath &Mrd . We will attempt to create a shaping ward to
shield against future fireballs. &Mrd says he can't spare the power. I
realize that I can't maintain for the 1.5 hours needed to complete the
spell. I setup for a last ditch attempt to finish in minutes. I will
need to summon water, shape and bind. I summon water and shape the stone
into an oblate spheroid. I address each tree in turn and ask for help
from its Dryad. I shape the power of faery and my own POW and create the
staff, surrounding the stone at the crown. I fail a willpower roll
however. I finish my binding. I am one with all three trees and the
staff (physically one). I manage to separate the staff from the trees. I
draw power from outside and from &Mrd . I reach earth and trees and shape
earth into the old form of &Mrp . The grove of trees stops growing, with
the pool still off-center, and the bush in the center. Between the trees
is an elvish pattern of transfer.

<para> &Mrp unconscious, &Mrd and CatBird put me on horse. I wake up on
ground, mount and ride. I have 1 POW and 3 HTK. The firebird fans a fire
towards us. We run into a gulley. I try to stop, but the horse goes
forward. I hang on for dear life, realize that the horse won't make it
and let go. Magic grasps me, my staff glows golden, I land softly on the
other side. We follow the gulley. We find Vartigan and he sees the cut
on my horse. I had put something on the cuts. The horses leg is starting
to swell. I dismount, spread my bedroll, enter a mage trance and sleep.
I wake up to see a Dissenta, hobble in back of him as he and &Sig fight.
When I get in back of him I attempt to stab him in the back with my
staff, miss and as he turns to me, Jaws gets him. I get up and the
Singing Warrior starts to attack me. ( He has been hit by a Dissenta
dagger) I hobble to &Mrd , warn him, and slip into mage trance, sleep. I
go back to the horses, mount and mage trance and after a while I slip
into healing trance. for the four days necessary for the trip back to
the city.

</para>

<para> {\it Ring\ } ``Yes.''
</para>

<para> {\it &Mrp\ } ``Do you have the minutes of the meeting ?''
</para>

<para> The ring does but the date is 980, roughly 35 years after &Mrp
thought it was. The ring also discovers that it has been inactive longer
than it expected. &Khl was worried that one of the Gray Wanderers was a
traitor but he did not know which one it was. The ring and &Mrp argue
over who is the real &Khl ! The ring and &Mrp argue over the locale of
the Ice Castle. It doesn't have any mental coordinates.
</para>

<para> The ring is known to the Gray Wanderers and they may know when
the ring is being used. They will definitely know when the ring is being
used to open the Ice Castle.
</para>

<para> The ring notes that the only bound sentience that it knows that
doesn't glow like a fucking neon sign is the sword MistSlicer, the Sword
of Light. Guardians don't count because they are elementals.

<para> &Mrp gives Palis the minutes of the last meeting of the Gray
Wanderers. &Khl and the Ice Wolf were breaking the contract. &Khl had
damaged the mind of someone the ring's personality was stored in. &Mrp
promised to tell Palis what really happened at the last meeting of the
Gray Wanderers.
</para>

<para> {\it Ring } ``Once we get tothe Ice Castle you can figure out
what happened to you. It's where all of your items are. I know where the

<para> {\it Palis\ } The ring is an artifact that the other Gray
Wanderers know about and they may know when it is being used.
</para>

<para> &Mrd contacts Uncle Tom's Habadashery and orders Silver and Silk
thread from him.
</para>

<para> Later &Mrp pulls the ring out again. He asks bout the &Lwon . The
ring tells him that it shapes power and mana. &Khl helped Nureyev design
and implement the linking ward and &Sig . Nureyev was a master
Alterationist/ Evocationist.
</para>

<para> &Khl did this when he was in his desperation phase. Of course,
that was before the Icelord came. &Khl established certain portals and
connections to allow him to access the Linking Ward. &Sig was one, the
Lizard Fortu was another. As far as we can determine, the Linking Ward
is a distributed network.
</para>

<para> We also confirm that the &Lwon contains the keys to the Bifrost.
</para>

<para> &Mrd boggles at the thought of CatBird walking the pattern.
</para>

<para> &Mrp , &Sig and &Em analyze the ring's design. The ring is
composed of :
</para>

<para> \begin{description} \item An abjurational shaping pattern \item
An evocation pattern (offensive) \item An Alteration shaping pattern
\item All linked to a single trigger spell \end{description}
</para>

<para> The pattern is similiar to that of &Mrp and there is an active
energy source.
</para>

<para> &Mrd picks up the ring and the ring attempts to zap him.
</para>

<para> Ring `` You let a bad guy touch it!''
</para>

<para> &Mrp `` Are Elves bad guys ?''
</para>

<para> Ring ``Clearly !''
</para>

<para> The ring queries &Mrp as to why he's running around with the Bad
Guys.
</para>

<para> &Mrp `` I am worried about the Bad Guys who want to destroy
everything and everyone.''
</para>

<para> Ring (In a scornful voice) ``Ohhhhhhh, so your sleeping with them
now to get at the other !''
</para>

<para> &Mrp ``Think about who we are.''
</para>

<para> Ring ``Yeah ?''
</para>

<para> &Mrp ``Well, we've never had any trouble sleeping with anybody
!''
</para>

<para> Ring ``I hate it when you are right !''
</para>

<para> Ring (muttered) ``Never go to the elves for answers, cause they
will tell you, that's what I always say..''
</para>

<para> &Mrp announces to all of the party that he had talked with
Falstaff. He discovered that &Khl helped in the design of the Ward of
Dof Sifrin. Supposedly Falstaff and &Khl voluntarily warded their
memories so that they could no longer use the Gates of Chronos and thus
bypass the Ward of Dof Sifrin. &Khl and Falstaff learned how to
mainpulate time from the Karestaen.
</para>

<para> Also, the Rainbow Order was started to give people purpose and
sort of snowballed.
</para>

<para> Falstaff has told &Mrp that Kay as well as Vartigan, &Sig, &Mrd,
and himself will face the Wizard King. Falstaff will pick us up on the
way.
</para>

<para> Kay and Falstaff helped design the \LWON . They modified the
notes that Nureyev wrote. After the notes were done, &Khl helped create
the linking ward \footnote{This was done without Falstaffs knowledge}.
He also helped Nureyev design &Sig during his desperation phase. The
\LWON was based on neural patterns and may have become sentient. The
ward allows the user to alter time flow without damaging the Ward of Dof
Sifrin. There are no passwords to the \LWON, it decides who may link
with it. There are 15 access ports to the \LWON, among them &Sig and the
Lizard Fortu. Nureyev made the Power Grid of Alkresh. The Bronze Ring
that &Mrp carries has a structure similiar to that of the \LWON.
According to the ring, the \LWON is alive , abjurational, and can shape
and transfer power. The ring also has detailed design notes on &Sig  .
</para>

<para> The Citadel of the Seven fell 700 years ago. It was located in
Dau Shao. There are currently many demons in the citadel. Someone was
working on CatBird's style of shapechanging. Muriel was connected to the
Tower of the Seven and studied under Petras, a master of conjuring and
dreamwalking. She learned to DreamWalk with &Khl .There is some sort of
tragedy associated with their relationship. The tragedy was the
inspiration for the play ``The Black Rose''. Nygold, &Khl's apprentice,
was one of the Seven. Acrivan wrote some books.
</para>

The Gray Wanderers were aided by Aurioch. The GW were given an Ice
Castle by Aurioch. All GW were required to be swordsman. The charter of
the GW was fairly basic: They were to preserve mankind, foment
revolution, and ensure that nobody gains the an upper hand. After the
Purge the GW agreed that they would not meet again for a long time and
three of them would go underground. The Storm Lord, the Blade of Stone,
and Tunbaxas. Falstaff would adopt a high profile. Tollen was known as
the Gray One. Ignatius was the Gray Wanderer known as the Ice Wolf.

&Em breaks up a fight between two merchants by flexing his aura. We make
it to the mages guild. The attendant, a mage floating 6 feet above the

Marden. ``Your mother was having an affair with a warrior of the
Sunloard, he may have been your father. He came and took you to the
monastery of Oriel. '' ``None of our family have lived to raise a family
except those that have hidden the curse.'' ``It is because of that man
and Muriel that we live as we do. Them and their sweeping arrogance.''
``I know that Muriel bears us no ill will, bears you no ill will''.

Subject: Not My Fault

Well, I don't know how much of a synopsis of last night you have
received by now but I just want to stress one thing. It's not my fault.
Actually everything seemed to go quite well, everyone worked closely
together as a team and we were far more effective than anyone
(especially alex) expected. The one exception was &Mrp who (as usual)
blew his own brains to pieces without any impact whatsoever on the
opponent, although for a change he did not significantly harm any of the
party members. In general &Mrp was the only casualty and there was
nothing we could have done to prevent that (no matter how much firepower
we had).
</para>

<para> In any case here is a short summation of the results at the end
of the night: o	Lythar is toast o	Paladin of Heimdal is dead but
managed to get one good strike in - at his request we managed to arrange
that he did not kick it while still in the Abyss. o	As a dieing act the
paladin gave the sword "Deathbane" to Eoman (of course &Cb gave it to
him in the first place but it's the thought that counts) o	Singing
warrior was completely uninjured (to my knowledge) and gave an extremely
good accounting of himself. o	&Mrp conjured what he thought was the
orb of enchantment to himself, it ended up being an "Orb of Souls?" I
don't know what that means yet. o	Otherwise everything went fine and
we are just a little tired.
