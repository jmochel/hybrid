Here are my rules for designing starships in the FUDGE system. I have tried
to keep with the premise of the system, and keep thing simple and flexable.
However, I realize that this system will not work for everyone's needs, but
I hope it will work with most space/science-fiction campeigns. However,
where specific examples are given, I have used my own campaign, called
Children of Man, and all rules specifically refereing to this campaign are
prefixed by    -CM-    .
	Please note, FUDGE is a copyrighted system, and this is not meant to
infringe on that copyright in any way. See chapter 1 of the main rules for
copyright details. Copies of the FUDGE rules are available by anonymous FTP
at soda.berkeley.edu in /pub/fudge.
	This system is also a "gift" to the creator of FUDGE. If he likes it, he
is welcome to take it and include it in FUDGE, thereby covering it under
the FUDGE copyright. Permission is granted to do this so long as my name
remains attached to these rules.

	Design theory: Starships are a very important aspect of any scince fiction
roleplaying game. Therefore, the deserve special consideration in the
rules. However, each scince-fiction campaign has it's own neccessities when
dealing with starships and each treats them a different way. So it's
important that rules for starship creation in a generic game like FUDGE be
as general as possible. Scientific accuracy is dropped to facilitate ease
of play. This has been my primary focus in designing these rules. Please
keep in mind these are only guidlines, and require some fine-tuning for
your specific campaign-verse.

	Starship design: As far as I can tell, there are six factors that are
common to most starships in any 'verse. These are: Hull, Defense,
Firepower, Agility, Control, and Power. These factors are rated by the
FUDGE word-system : Terrible, Poor, Mediocre, Fair, Good, Great, and
Superb. (In places, the corresping numbers to the words will be used in
stead, where "Terrible" is one [1] and "Superb" is seven [7]).
	The six factors are treated like attribues, and cost  pts per level.
Beyond that, ships may have advantages and disadvantges --- depending on
the campaign, they may be technical (like: poor computer), or highly
untechnical (like a ship with luck). Advantages and disadvantages cost 1 pt
each.
	The relationship between points and money in the game world is entirely
left up to the GM. It is a generic system, representing neither actual play
balance nor real money cost. I avoid giving a system for starship cost
because not only does each 'verse vary, but different GMs want differing
amounts of complexity.
	[ -CM-: The system I use to aproximate starship cost is C=2^p/5, where
c=cost in megacredits, and p=point value of starship. That is, every
increase by five doubles the cost. The combat effectiveness avlue of the
ship is the sum of its hull + defense + firepower ratings, + the difference
between control and hull, + the difference between its agility and "fair"
(4), + the differnce between power and the higher of hull, def, or off +-
any combat related advantages or disadvantages.]

	Hull: Hull is the measure of the size of the ship. Guidlines to this based
on -CM- are given below. It is also the rating of how much damage the
ship's hull can withstand before being destroyed. Thus, a high-tech ship
would be smaller than a ship of lower-tech of the equivelant hull.
	Terrible: Fighter or shuttle size
	Poor:      Frigate size
	Mediocre: Destroyer size
	Fair: cruiser size
	Good: Battleship size
	Great: Dreadnaught size
	Superb: space-station size

	Defense: Defense is the generic rating of the ability of the craft to
either avoid or resist damage. It includes such things as maneuverability,
armor, shields, ECM, etc. Note, in some games, some of these may be
advantages rather than part of Defense:
	-CM- Dampeners are an advantage and are not included in the Defense (since
most ships don't have them).
	Starships have a minimum defense rating of terrible.
	Terrible: just unreinforced hull
	Poor: some armoring or _really_ slow
	Mediocre: some minor defense flaw: small ship, slow, poor armor
	Fair: average
	Good: reinforced armor, point defense system
	Great: heavy armor and shielding; a ship with cloak
	Superb: practically unatainable: polysynthesized pseudoceramic plating.

	Firepower: Firepower represents the damage dealing capacity of the ship.
It is a pool of all the weapons on the ship, their range, accuracy and
damage. The rating corresponds to a combat ship hull-size. Thus, an average
frigate would have Poor firepower. Obviously, some ships may have no
firepower.
	Two typical disadvantges associated with firepower are "no large weapons"
and "no small weapons," Typically, the firepower value is a mix of heavy
and light weaponry. With "no large weapons," the ship still has as many
points in firepower, but may not divy up more points of firepower in combat
against one ship than 2-3 (1 pt dis.) or 1 (2pt dis.) Obviously, ships with
terrible or poor firepower should not be allowed to take this disadvange.
	"No small weapons," on the other hand, means that all the ship's firepower
is concentrated in one or two primary weapons. Thus, the ship may only
devide it's firepower among no more than two ships (1 pt dis.)

	Agility: agility is a combination of acceleration and maneuverablity. The
amount by which the ship accelerates depends upon the game, the following
are for -CM-.
	Terrible: .1g
	Poor: .25g
	Mediocre: .75g
	Fair: 1.5g
	Good: 2g
	Great: 2.5g
	Superb: 3.0g
Note, the increase of accleration decreases in the higher ratings because
higher agility more reflects maneuverability than speed.

	Crew: Crew represents both size and quality of the crew, plus all ship
controls (like the bridge, engineering, etc). If crew ever drops below
hull, all rolls are - the difference. If crew drops to 0, the ship can no
longer be controlled (most of the crew is dead).
	Typical disadvantage: No bulkheads: the first point of hull damage also
destroys a point of crew.
	Typical advantage: Military bulkheads: the first point of damage vs. crew
is ignored.

	Powerplant: This represents the power available to the craft. Power must
be equal or higher than the highest of defense, firepower, or agility. If
it falls below those values, loose one point from one of the three until
repaired (ie: a ship has def 3, fp 4, ag2, and pwr 4. It looses a point of
power plant; it must now loose a point from one of those three). A higher
power plant could be "pushed" to provide extra capacity. Roll 1d6. If the
result is 2-6, the point can be successfully added; if the result is 1,
loose a point of power).

	A note on FTL: -CM- treats FTL ability as an advantage. Feel free to do
anything else with it you like.

	Starship combat: NOTE: These rules are only for -CM-. Feel free to create
your own. -CM- combat is based around one of two "types": either a head on
charge, with turn-arounds; or a side-to side battle. These rules describe a
"charge" type battle, and each turn takes 1/2 hour; side-to-side battles
only take 10 minutes each turn, but all advantage rolls are pulled in one
more toward Fair (4).

	Step 1: Each ship rolls for advantage. This is based off of Crew. During
the remainder of combat, a ship with advantge over another gets to add +1
to all rolls involving that ship, as well as getting in +1 hit against it.

	Step 2: Maneuvering: all maneuver rolls are based off of agility. Example
rolls may be evade (the evaded ship may not fire at you), follow, shadow,
dogfight, etc.

	Step 3: Damage: Each ship gets a number of damage points to divy up
against other ships = firepower plus the result of a standard roll (Min=1,
max=double.) Once all damage against each ship is tallied, that number is
subject to a standard roll modifier. Devide this amount by the ships
defense to determine how many hits it takes.
	Each hit reduces one of the six ship traits or one destroyable advantage.
The easiest way to do this is roll 1d6 for each hit to determine wher it
lands. If a ship takes more than two hits in the same place during a
volley, it looses a special item. optionally, the controlling player may
elect to loose that advantage first (like opting to take a cargo bay hit
instead of a hull hit). However, 1/3 of all hits will be applied to the
hull. If the GM thinks this produces too many hull hits, let the damage hit
result of 1 be a special hit (vs. an advantage or some other special
result, like the ship looses power to all weapons for one turn.)
