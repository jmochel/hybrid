Concerning the attributes proposed...
        You have to balance the attributes you want to put into the
game against basic game mechanics. I feel that you have some good ideas
for the attributes, but they need to be looked at.
        Give each attribute a purpose in the game. The physical attributes
are obviously necessary for fighting, but what about the others? I hate to
be nasty, but I honestly can't see any reason for Instinct and Passion
attributes. Instinct is something that must come from the player or the
attribute will be used to have the GM guide the player down the rosey trail
to the end of the adventure, all because the character had a high score in
his Instinct score. Passion simply, as far as my 5 brain cells can see, has
little to no relevance in a game. If you say that it is like Charisma, then
call it that and keep it simple.
        I don't mean for this to be inflamatory, just something that will
guide us all to a better game. If ANYONE is going to design a game, then
I think your first step should be laying down the parameters of what the
game is going to be.
        GENRE: What kind of RPG are we talking about?
                This could range anywhere from AD&D to Shadowrun.
        TIME PERIOD: Is it going to be past? Present? Future? Anachronistic
                combination?
        CLASSES/ARCHETYPES: The types of characters will play a big factor
                in what your attributes are.

        Before we can start building the infrastructure of the game, we
need to lay the foundation first. Comments are quite welcome. (And
necessary from my viewpoint...)
