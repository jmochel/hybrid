Sorry but this is incorrect.  Reasoning means the ability to apply facts.
Knowledge is pure memory.

I knew someone when I was in school who was Dean's list in my Computer
Science Class.  This person could memorize anything, but couldn't apply any
of it.  The person did very well on tests, but always was bugging me for help
on homework that required independent thought.

On the opposite side, I don't memorize well, but I understand general
concepts pretty well.  I can reason but not memorize (part of my dyslexia I
suspect).

There's a big difference (even without mentioning the Idiot Savante)!
