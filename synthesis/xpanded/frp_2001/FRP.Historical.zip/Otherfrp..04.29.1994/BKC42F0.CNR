This is in reply to the original post on an attribute system (by Guy T.), Dave
W.s addition to it, and Jason's alternate system.
        I think that Guy's and Dave's system will work better in play, because
they would be slightly easier to explain/understand.  As for the DEX breakdown
- I like it.  Why not call the two Manual Dexterity, and the larger movements
Agility?  And for the CON breakdown, call them Resistance and Constitution (or
Health).
        Guy:  Please send me a private (or public if you feel it may be
necessary) letter with a little more info about the Passion and Self
attributes.  I am not sure I understand them well...
        Jason:  It's not that I don't like your system - it's that I don't
understand it very well, and wouldn't be able to explain it to my players.

BIG QUESTION ON ATTRIBUTE SYSTEM:  Will it be a randomly generated attribute
system (a la D&D and Rolemaster) or a player-chosen system based on points (a
la GURPS and HEROSystem)???  I think that this will be important to decide
early because it will determine whether we need to decide the costs of skills
and the like (in points) or set up tables for random generation.

So far, I like the system, and am already planning on using it in the system I
am devising my campaign (a modified Fantasy Hero game) in place of the current
attribute system.

ANOTHER BIG NOTE:  I think we should all agree now that all submissions to this
list are freeware FOR NONCOMMERCIAL USERS AND USES only.  I so agree - Any
submissions I make regarding game design may be used by anyone who gets them,
without attributing them to me, as long as they are used for non-commercial
purposes only.  My ideas are not to be included in any commercial release
without my express written approval in advance of publication.

I hope that's all nice and legal.
