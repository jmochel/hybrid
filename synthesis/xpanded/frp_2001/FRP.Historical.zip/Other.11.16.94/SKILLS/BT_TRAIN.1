>P.S. training rule checklist.  Please double check.

Good Idea!

>You get 1 EP every 10 hours of self study, at a cost of 50 Ext. (Exaustion)

Ummm.. no 10 hours of study costs 100 Ext!  

>You get 1 EP every 8 hours of group study, at a cost of 40 Ext.

Likewise- 80 ext!  Maybe this is why you thought traiing was too easy!

>You get 1 EP every (5 hours - 15 min * (teachers teaching level +

>

There is a minimum- the combined teacher's rank differential in the skill with
the student and teaching skill cannot exceed 8.   Therefore the fastest anyone 
can learn is 3 hours per ep!  Now mind you the teacher still adds 1% per rank 
to the ep roll so.... 

Remember also Meta-Exhaustion!  Both Physical and Mental Exhayuustion feed into it
and it accumulates at 1 Meta-Exhaustion per 10 Exhaustion used.  (That may be 
too harsh- I am not sure! I am playing with going to 20 Exhaustion used equals a 
Meta-Exhaustion.



ALso-> Training rules:  Typically one cannot train more than (INT + DRV)/4 in a day.
	EXHAUSTION(includes mental and physical sim.) COMES BACK:  
		2 per hour of rest
		Sleep-> 2 first hour, 4 second hour, 8 every hour thereafter
		Meals-> A meal will restore 3 ext. (Maximum three meals per day- at
			least one hour apart.)
	META-EXHAUSTION comes back: 
		1 per NIGHT of sleep
		1 every 4 hours if a total day is spent in rest, if most of the day 
			is restful, and no HEAVY labor is one 1 per 8 hours is
			recovered  (one cannot use more than a quarter of one's 
			exhaustion on a day such as this.)

	Using these rules I calculated a driven, intelligent student with the best 
teachers and time to burn could earn around 600 eeps in a year.  That is optimal!
It assumes the student has a 16 INT and a 16 DRV.  

That is the equivelant 0f about 14-15 runs.  I am not sure that's a bad thing!  


BTW:  I odn't havce my notes with me so if any of these number s are worng let me
know- I don't think they are.  BUt my formula for maximum hours of trianing a day, 
or maybe speed of recovery of exhaustion is a little off- but it will only be a marginal difference.  These are at LEAST ball park correct numbers, and probably 
completely correct.

Hopefully we will get to start playing more next year! (Jazz and Dangerous- your building up lack of running momentum!)

	If you train more than 7 hours per day you lose 7 Meta
exhaustion and will need to rest at least 1 day.  So, you can't train
more than half the days in a year effectively, so with 16 Int and Drv,
you will be able to train less than 4 hours per day on average.  That
gives 486.67 EP's per year.

I think your recovery rates for exhaustion are too slow.  Ex- I don't
think it would be unusual to train for 8 hours, (Military, intensive 
schooling, corporate training, fanatic MAers ;-) for extended periods 
of time.
8 hours- 80 ex.  Recovery- 8 hrs sleep 2+4+6(8)=54.  3 meals=9.  63!
Even if you rest a few hours, you still aren't making it!  Am I 
missing something here?  I also thought that ex only built up if you 
used large % of your endurance.  Is that rule going away??
I read somewhere (not sure where) that according to military 
research, long term sleep deprivation is almost totally recovered in 
a single 8 hour sleep.  To me this implies that the rate may be more
logo than you are creditting.  Ideally, I think end/ex should come
back the same as HTK, even though it is more bookkeeping.  Maybe
just a continuos slope?  2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10 + 12 + 14 + 16 = 72
I don't think that is unreasonable.  Otherwise, having high end values
becomes less valuable- you can't use it if you can't recover it!

----- End Included Message -----


Hmmm.. I agree in part.   Although long-term sleep deprivation can be 
wiped out by a single night's sleep- what about muscle fatigue and 
strain?  What about mental exhaustion?  

I actually haven't gotten research behind this but my experience is 
that muscle fatigue can last a day or two even under full rest 
conditions.

I don't have a clear idea about mental exhaustion.  I do "feel" that
you prpobably can recover from most menatl exhaution overnight- but
I have worked on menatl projects and been still menatlly tired the next
day (though obviously there could be many factors there.)
Opinions?

BTW: I do agree though that maybe it should be +2 points per hour of 
sleep.

BTW2: Meta-exhaustion models wear and tear above and beyond tiredness.
