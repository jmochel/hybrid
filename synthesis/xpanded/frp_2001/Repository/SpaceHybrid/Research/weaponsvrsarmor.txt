I'm gona do this in several posts
first i'm goan describe the weapons used in testing, and the dammage they did to a dry pine 2x4. i'm including this so that others
can know about how hard i hit the armor. Then next i'll post the armor type and what effect the weapons had on it.

Message: 

The ring mail i made was 9 gauge highcarbon butted rings (i normaly use forge welded but did not want to do that much work
for this test) the rings had about a 1 inch diamater.
they were laced onto a leather vambrace in four places each, each ring was laced seperatly, so if one lave broke the whole
thing did not bust.
the rings were laced on 3 ounce leather with anothe 3 ounce backing to cover the laces.

Message: 

My copper chain is made of 14 and 16 gauge copper 3/8 in diamater rivited flattened rings. There are more 14 gaude in there
than 16 but when flattened they all fit well.
all rivits were soft 22 gauge steel wire. any failures in the chain were due to the rivits giving out. So i would assume that if i had
used copper rivits i would have had much worse results.
the copper was unhardened eccept for whatever work hardening occured during flattening the rings.

test were done on copper chainmaille by itself (had minor padding underneath) then with waxed leather plates unde the copper.

bruising was severe on almost all slashes and particulaly on the axes

Message: 

this was a 16 gauge steel german wwII helmet. It has been polished and the paint removed. (no matt i'm sending you a swiss
one, don't worry that i destrowed your helmet, yours is tougher than this one)
The glancing surfaces were very good on this helmet, and it took several hits with each weapon before i got one that had
results.

during this testing i discovered exactly how cheep by claymore was. I will post where i got the playmore and the dammage it
took at the bottom of this post.

Miscellaneous observations from the testing: 

Also some interesting things I gathered from my testing, Flattened butted rings resist pucture much more than round wire rings

flattened had just a hair more trouble against slashing/cutting/hacking blows though

Rivit strength seemed to play a big part in puncture resistance, Copper rings with iron rivits did better against puncture than
iron rings with copper rivits

a slight curve in the rings, Like a pringles chip, allowed better glancing even when going cross grain on the maille.

I know there were more things I learned, but I can't bring them to mind right now,

Message: 

Hi Dwarlock and Everyone at this Site!

Dwarlock, thank you for all the effort you put into your weapons/armour testing. 

Again, Dwarlock, thank you for discussing rawhide as the basis for cuir bouilli. Sir Bruno (Midrealm) had experimented with
this in the 70s, but no one (to my limited knowledge) has seriously pursued this line of thought. I'm looking forward to the
discussion in the 1997 Royal Armouries Yearbook (See the Arador Site for a comment from Mr. Thom Richardson of the
Royal Armouries.). Please keep us posted with your experience (drop a note at Arador), for I suspect you are close to the true
nature of cuir bouilli with your work.

Regarding maille, these are the results of some testing I performed about 15 years ago. 

Description of the target: Butted maille in the conventional 4-in-1 pattern. Wire gauge: 16. Inside diameter: 1/4 inch. Material:
annealed steel. With the exception of the fact that the maille was not riveted and it was round in cross-section, I thought it was
moderately representative of mediaeval maille. There was 1/2 inch of padding behind the maille. The maille was attached to a
rigid wooden structure. The rationale behind rigid structure, was that since I'm not a mediaeval knight who has trained to do this
for a lifetime, I wanted a slight bias in favor of the weapon ... hence less "give" for the target.

The weapons (all manufactured by Del Tin of Italy and had been subsequently given an edge) and their effects:

1) A 9-10th Century Sword with a mass of 2.5 pounds scored the links and produced minor deformation. You might get
bruised, but otherwise you'd be alive and well.

2) A late 13th Century Sword with a mass of 3.25 pounds produced greater scoring and deformation. Repeated blows to the
same area might eventually mechanically tear the maille apart and render you vulnerable to a strike directly to your body.

3) A late 13th Century "Sword of War" (or "Grete Swerd" or "Bastard Sword" or "Hand and a Half Sword") with a mass of 3.5
pounds produced yet even greater deformation.

>>> The results with weapons #2 and #3 are closely related to the descriptions of the gradual damage to maille hauberks as
combat progresses as described in the 12th Century "Death of Arthur." In this regard mediaeval combat would progress more
like an extended boxing match with repeated blows rather than the "one blow/kill" of SCA combat.

4) A great axe of the 10-13th Centuries with a mass of 2.75 pounds (probably a little heavier than the real thing) simply sheared
through the maille as if it weren't there. (Those dreadful scenes in the Bayeux Tapestry appear right on with the damage those
axes caused.)

Good Fortune to All! - D2
