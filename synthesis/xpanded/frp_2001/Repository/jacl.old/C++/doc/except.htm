<P>General Guidelines</P>

<OL>
<LI>Exception handling must pervade the entire program or library</LI>

<LI>Don't throw an exception unless necessary.</LI>

<OL>
<LI>Throw an exception to indicate a failure of an operation for which
failure is not a normal mode</LI>
</OL>

<LI>Don't catch an exception you don't know how to handle !</LI>

<LI>Rethrow all exceptions caught in a <TT>(...) clause</TT></LI>

<OL>
<LI>Remember to reset the state (if necessary)&nbsp;before rethrowing.</LI>
</OL>

<LI>Order the exception handlers from the most specific to the most general</LI>

<OL>
<LI>catch(...) should always be last.</LI>
</OL>

<LI>Document all conditions that could generate an exception</LI>
</OL>

<OL>
<LI>Derive exceptions from the standard exception class</LI>

<OL>
<P>Allows the user of the class to select what to catch.</P>
</OL>

<LI>Derive multiple exception class from a base class derived for that
purpose</LI>

<OL>
<P>This is one of the few areas where multiple inheritance makes sense</P>
</OL>

<LI>Provide useful information in the exception</LI>

<LI>Give the user a way to avoid the exception</LI>

<LI>Give the user a way to disable throwing the exception</LI>

<LI>Give the user a way to disable unwanted runtime tests</LI>

<OL>
<P>#ifdef them out ?</P>
</OL>

<LI>If you can't recover, throw a special exception to exit the program.</LI>

<LI>Don't throw exceptions from destructors</LI>

<LI>Classes must be in a state suitable for cleanup</LI>

<OL>
<LI>If you can, leave the object in the state it had when the method was
entered</LI>

<LI>If you can't leave the object in the state it had when the method was
entered, leave it in a clean state</LI>

<LI>If you can't leave the object in a good state it, make sure the destructor
can still work</LI>

<LI>Generally, any state should be a clean state</LI>

<LI>Make sure that ownership of memory is well defined.</LI>
