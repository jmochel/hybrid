			Defect Severity 

============================================================================

Critical Performance/Functionality Defects
------------------------------------------
Critical performance/Functionality Defects are those defects that 
cause unrecoverable errors during a test run. Examples of these 
defects are:
Corrupt data.
Crash the application.
Hanging the system.

Serious Performance/Functionality Defects
-----------------------------------------
Serious Level Performance/Functionality Defects are those defects 
that have a major impact on functionality. These defects require a 
serious amount effort to work around the area affected. Examples of 
these defects are:
Functionality not implemented.
Failure of system to return all resources to the operating system on exit.

Medium Performance/Functionality Defects
----------------------------------------
Medium Level Performance/Functionality Defects are those defects 
that have some impact on functionality. These defects require some 
effort to work around the bug. Examples of these defects are:
A specific set of non-standard instructions cause an unexpected result.

Low Level Performance/Functionality Defects
Low Level Performance/Functionality Defects are those defects that 
have little or no impact on functionality. Examples of these defects 
are:
Longer than normal lags.
Having to re-select buttons.

Functionality Enhancement Requests
----------------------------------
Software enhancements are additions to the functionality specification. 
These are areas of functionality that were not included in the 
functional specification. However during the course of development 
and testing, some area(s) will probably be discovered to be awkward 
and/or some additional functionality will be needed. Enhancements 
will be implemented as time, resources and budgeting allow. All 
enhancements that are made to the application will require that the 
Functional Specification be updated accordingly.

			Defect Priority

============================================================================


Critical Level
--------------
The fix/enhancement is required in the current revision.

High Level
----------
The fix/enhancement should be in the current revision if it does not 
severely impact the release schedule.

Medium Level
------------
The fix/enhancement should be in the current revision if it does not
impact the release schedule.

Low Level
----------
The fix/enhancement should be added when time, resources and 
budgeting allows.
