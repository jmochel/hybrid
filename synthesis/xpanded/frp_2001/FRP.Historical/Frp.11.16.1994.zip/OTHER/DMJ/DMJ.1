Hmm..  Seems like my proposal was missed, which was simply to use the  
same roll as a damage modifier that is used for the opposed action.

My proposal was (let's see if I can remember):

Strength (i.e. Str+Scale) + Weapon Modifier + Roll = Damage.

Sword fighting again, eh.  Well, here's my two cents.

As far as getting hit on the arm don't forget that when blocking, the arm is generally
held perpendicular to the sword so hits *shouldn't* "slide* off the sword onto the
arm.  Also, don't forget the guard on the sword.  This is intended to catch the opponent's blade, 
preventing it from "sliding" off again.

Now, I am a competative fencer but fencing is far different from actual sword fighting
portrayed in most role-playing games.  I do get hit in the arm alot but that is the
nature of the sport.  In epee, the whole body is the target and the arm is the closest
target area to aim for.  Also in epee and in foil we parry as opposed to blocking
(sabreuers do the blocking but I don't fence sabre).  In a parry, you keep the point of
the weapon generally aimed at your opponent for the purpose of reposting.

So, in escense I have just disqualified my self from contributing to this discussion.

Okay, how about

Damage = Active Skill/Attribute (you decide) + roll - Resistive Skill?

TORG, for example, has (or used to have) a very easy-to-use combat  
system.  

A roll was made, resulting in a -12 to +inf., which is added to "Active  
Skill" (this could be Melee Wpns, Missile Wpns, Fire Combat, Business  
Skill, Gambling, Test of Wills, Intimidate, Maneuver, Trick, Persuade,  
Charm, .... ).  If this is higher than Defending Skill, then a "hit" was  
scored.  

This same rolled number would be added to the "Effect Skill" (Strength  
for melee/missile weapons, with a mod. for weapon; A straight number for  
firearms, and for other skills usually the same as the Active Skill), and  
the "Resisting Skill" would be subtracted (usu. Toughness, or the same as  
the Defending Skill).

Why not use a system like this?

In summary, and in FUDGEy terms:

A random number is generated:  -4 to +4

This is applied to Active Skill.  If this is higher than Defending Skill,  
then score a "hit".

Use the same random number to add to Effect Skill (maybe the same as  
Active), with mod for "weapon", and subtract Resistive Skill.

Result is number of damage done.

This could either be done with the current simultaneous combat in FUDGE,  
or turns-taking combat could be used.  It doesn't really matter, though.

I enjoy the creativity and social interaction in role-playing, not seeing  
who can roll better dice than someone else.  The current proposals are so  
laden with dice rolls, pip counting, and special cases they can be considered
"Gaming" only in the sense of mathematical recreations.

They are not an "Engine". The current proposals are all in terms of which
skills give which rolls which have what effects.  I believe FUDGE should
provide a method for dealing with combat, and it should be the GM's duty  
to say what skills, rolls, and effects are assessed.  I believe everything  
in FUDGE should be this way.

FUDGE is targeted more toward the experienced games willing to put effort
into customizing the system to get the game they want.  I feel the same
direction should be used for the combat system.  If someone figures out  
the 'best damage system ever' it can be included in an appendix, but the game
should not be designed to rely on it. To provide some constructive  
feedback, here is an example of the kind of combat system I would recommend.  I am  
not saying it is better or even well thought-out, but it does show the way I
think FUDGE combat should be approached.

Combat is resolved as an opposed action between an "attacking" and
"defending" force.  If both forces are able to attack and defend they
alternate roles, the GM will determine which force 'attacks' first from
context.  The GM adds all the attacker's contributing traits and  
situational modifiers, and subtracts all the defender's contributing traits.  The GM
determines how many traits can be applied and which are appropriate, but  
the players get to choose which traits to apply.  The degree of success is
compared against a list of conflict resolutions specific to the  
situation.

I'll try to describe the system using everyone's favorite example; a
swordfight.  Player A gets the drop on player B, both are armed with
longswords.  During character generation, the GM said that each character  
can use up to 2 traits for attack and defense, and gave guidelines on what  
traits are appropriate.  Player A says he will use his Longsword skill and  
Strength attribute.  Player B wants to defend with his Intimidation skill and  
Courage attribute, but the GM says since A surprised him and has never seen B's
fearsome tactics, B cannot use his Intimidation skill this round.  B is
forced to rely on his weaker Melee skill.  To hit an aware opponent in  
this GM's world is a Good degree task.  After taking the modifications into
account, A gets a Good +3 roll.  This GM's Melee Combat Conflict  
Resolution list goes like this: Healthy, Superficial Scratch, Lightly Wounded,  
Wounded, Badly Wounded, Severely Wounded, Incapacitated, Fatally Wounded, Near  
Death, Dead, Annihilated.  +3 damage puts B at Badly Wounded.

I came up with this example on the spur of the moment, but it shows what  
I would expect of FUDGE.  It is freeform, universal, and provides  
opportunities for GM customization and player interaction.  The GM can change the  
flavor and 'power level' of her campaign by selecting the number and type of  
traits applicable to combat.  Players can choose individual fighting styles and
descriptions.  All the effects are given in terms of words, not  
calculations.

There have been a lot of arguements about which traits and features apply  
to combat, and how much.  I feel the FUDGE way is to provide a framework for
each player and GM to determine which features they feel contributes best  
to the gaming experience.

Trust me, people, Tony's got it right.  You'd be surprised how fast
a good fighter can land a three or even four-blow combination on you.
The "rebound off the shield and strike the opposite side of the helm" shot
is not under two seconds, it's under one second, or you're already "dead" --
extend the arm to nearly max with a sideways wrist-flip for the first blow,
then a rotation along the arm for the second -- entire combination, from
rest, takes about one second.  Maybe.  Otherwise it doesn't work.  The shield
defense is to lift your shield vertically, so that the other edge blocks access
to the side of your helm.  You simply don't have time to move your shield
twice to block.  (The sword defense generally loses you an arm,
unless you're very, very good... or your opponent took more than a second.)

"A thin tracery of scars on the arm" results from lightweight sword dueling --
rapier, fencing (no edge on the "blade", hard to scar), or _maybe_ epee --
not the broadsword.  No broadsword is going to leave a "thin tracery" of
anything; cuts will lay you open bigtime.  Unless it's a really sharp blade...
in which case your "scar" will be at the end of your stump.

I never met Moonwolf in my 4 years in the SCA -- but I heard a lot about him.
One of the best fighters around.  My fighting was strictly local -- but there
were several good fighters from the Cleftlands (Cleveland) and Gwyntarion
(Kent State) who came down to beat on us regularly.

Hmmm, this might be a good idea.  I must have missed it, too.  Let's see,
this is basically getting rid of the relative degree and adding in the
attacker's die roll.  It means that the defender's efforts affect whether
or not he was hit, but not how much he was hurt.  This reduces damage some,
since the damage roll part is centered around strength and weapon without
the relative degree.  We could readjust for that, and it might be partly
made up for by positive dice rolls being more likely to hit.

However, I propose we use the idea of using the attacker's roll for the
damage roll in the current system, but leave the relative degree in the
equation.  Damage is: relative degree + Scale+str + weapon + roll.  Now
the damage center is at the same place the current system uses, and the
damage roll is there without having to actually roll.  It might move
damage up a bit, because blows that hit are likely to have positive dice.

I'm going to simulate this idea, both as proposed by Michael and my version.

Currently, my main RPG is Torg, and I can tell you from experience
that there is one major flaw with this method:  Basically, if
something is very difficult to hit (therefore requiring a very
large bonus to connect with it), then you are either going to
miss it (usually), or destroy it with one blow.  Since the same
huge bonus that is needed to hit the thing is also applied to 
damage, when you hit, the damage is guaranteed to be very large.
There is no in-between.  For "normal" chances to hit, this system
works fairly well, but I don't like this flaw, and I have even
experimented with a variety of ways to use two die rolls, one
to hit and one for damage, like most games out there.  Most
games use this, because this is the easiest way to reflect the
relative "independence" of hitting and damage.

Turns out that this system lets the equal blows against the same opponent
do different damage.  Example ("Good defense" means defender's trait+roll):

1) trait: Superb + roll: -1 = Great vs Good defense gives relative degree +1,
	roll subtracts 1 from damage, result applied to damage is 0.
2) trait: Good + roll: +1 = Great vs Good defense gives relative degree +1,
	roll adds 1 to damage, result applied to damage is +2.

I think it would be frustrating for the Superb fighter in that situation:
both do Great blows against the same opponent, worse fighter does +2 better.
Of course, it would even out over time: when the Superb fighter rolls +1
and the Good fighter rolls -1, the results are very different!

Subject: One more into the breach. Fudge Damage

If someone else has already suggested the simple damage system below, then
take this as a vote of support. Here is a simple modification of Fudge jul93
combat. Allows for weapons, strength/scale, and still a single opposed dice
throw. 

  Opposed roll for combat as usual. BUT whether you have damage potential
or not is dependent on rolling Fair or better (not on winning the combat).
The difference between the opposed rolls is basic damage as before except
for winner it is positive (obvious) and loser it is negative.
Damage is weapon+strength/scale modifier (predetermined) + basic damage.
If negative, then no damage.

Eg, A rolls a result of superb, B rolls good. Both do damage.
    A does weapon+strength+scale+1
    B does weapon+strength+scale-1
Normal humans would be scale 0, strength 0. Dagger say -1, one handed sword
0. Damage capacity modified accordingly.

GM may call a change to basic hit dependent on other factors. (eg may require
that an fully armoured knight needs Good or better. An unarmoured person
only needs Poor or better).

Ranged weapons work same way, except basic chance to hit goes up. Should
be one higher for opposed roll, than if roll was unopposed. (And of course
the defender doesnt do damage). Eg A fires bow a B. GM declares his chance
to hit at that range etc is Fair, if unopposed, so needs Good to hit on
opposed roll. Even if gets it, then if defender rolls better, then the
difference will reduce damage.
