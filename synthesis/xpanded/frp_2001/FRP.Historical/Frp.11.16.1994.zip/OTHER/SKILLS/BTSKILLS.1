Here are the benefits of BT general skills:

(1)The RANK bonus to success chance(3% per rank) is applied to all 
	the skills that fall under its umbrella.  This
	is above and beyond the normal maximum of two secondaries.
(2)(RANK-2)/2 in both SPD and DAM to ALL those skills.
(3)Full familiarity with the skills that fall under the umbrella of
	the general skill.
(4)Even if you don't have it there is an intrinsic lore/perception 
	skill that goes with each General skill.  The chance,
	if you don't have the skill is 3% per RANK in general
	skill with the following modifieres: +80 for basic, 
	bottom-line quetsions and awarenesses in that domain, +40
	for simple questions/awarenesses, +20 for standard but
	more complicated ones, +0 for questions of medium difficulty.
(5) It adds to the Level Factor like any other skill

Here are the disadvantages of BT General skills:

(1) They cost twice as much as normal skills (2 xp rolls per roll or
	twice as much training time.
(2) Bonus to skills is only 3% per rank
(3) Rank mods for SPD and DAM are half that of a primary skill.



NOw- let us take James example of CLASS A:3 10's in General skills and 
CLASS B: 6 10s in primary skills.  First off this is the most disadvantageous way to look 
at primary skills but that is fine... Let's do it:

(1)
CLASS B give one a 60 SCF.  And you have six 160% chances to hit.

CLASS A give one a 30 SCF, and +30 to approximately 18 skills (your standard
general skill umbrella's over about 5-6 skills).   So their chance in
this closed artificial environment is 60%.  SO in terms of chance you have three
skills that have 100% more chance than six of the umbrella'd skills and
the generalist has a 60% chance to do 12 MORE skills at 60%.

(2)
CLASS A has advantages that don't show up in the other skills-
like (RANK-2)/2 in SPD and DAM.  So CLASS A has +4 SPD points and +4 DAM in 
18 skills.  CLASS B has +8 SPD and +8 DAm in six skills.  (s)he also has 
+1-3 more spd based on the level factor sdifference(and which level factor).  

(3)
CLASS A has whatever advantage 30 more level factor points bring one.  In
SCF that is 60 MEN, +15 MAP; in PCF it is +3 SPD, +30 PER.  This is an 
advantage.   But what makes CLASS A gross is that it applies to !18! skills.
It gives you familiarity, extra pluses to effect and speed and bonuses to 
hit above and beyond the usual BT limitations. 

All this still makes me think they are worth double.  

AND... AND I would just a soon have them be a little more expensive because
of the special bonuses they give. 

A more complimentary example for general skills is to look at them in the 
perspective they wer eintended to be used in- as complementary skills-
I a sniper has a 10 in rifle, the absolute best thing they can do is get a 
10 in G: Guns.  Why?  Becasue before they even achieve an 11 with hteir rolls 
they will achieve a 10 in G:guns and that is worth a +40, +4.5 SPD and +4 DAM.
OBSCENE!  If they bought two tens in primary skills in the same area they
would get +20(because of mcf), +1 SPD, and no damage bonuses--- AND G:guns
will giv eits bonus to 5 othe rkinds of guns!!!!!!   Is it expensive?  Yes.
Is it clealry worth it?  Not clearly- it may or may not be- depending on your 
skill distribution..  and that's fine with me.


Thoughts?

BTW:  I seem to be the only one who ever heard of General 
skills being double cost.


FOr now- everyone saty calm- General skills will cost the 
same until Rev.5 (which I had hoped would be out by now but is
still two weekends of work away from completiomn....

Just look at the arguments and giv eme input on whether you think
it should be double cost or not...



	SIGH!:-(

Subject: Re: [long design post]DES: BT Background theory

   Here are some more arguments...

   Kata:  I had never heard that you broke kata up into "sets" before.  I
like this model.  It is consistant with the way people remember things
(like breaking long numbers up into pairs or sets of three to remember them).

   Defense/PAB/Rolling with a Blow:  I still think there are too many over-
lapping mechanisms, but no new arguments.

   Horsemanship:  Yes, it requires agility to ride a horse.  I handle that
by having people roll AG saves if they fail their horsemanship.  (Of course,
my system is fairly different here).  It does require agility to ride a
horse, but it also requires a lot of agility to throw a solid kick, still,
you haven't put kick in AGF rather than PCF.
   In my experinece with riding horses, you may shift your weight as you
ride (as you do in any sharply cornering or bumpy vehicle).  I don't know
about you, but I steer more with the reins than with my weight.  Nonetheless,
let's consider your argument about "convincing" the horse with your weight.
This would mean that fat people would be better on horseback than small
people, right?  (Yet, most jockeys seem to be small, so your logic is 
obviously faulty :-).  More seriously, consider riding an elephant.  I doubt
your weight will do much to "convince" an elephant where to move, yet it
seems that elephant riding and horse riding ought to be similar skills
(the same people run the elephant rides and the pony rides, after all :-)
   If I have to "convince" the horse, can I use my Persuasion and Leadership
as secondaries? :-)
   You never did answer where you would put Chariot as a skill.  To stand
and drive a Chariot certainly takes a high AGL, but if you put Chariot in 
AGF, then what about Sulkie or Carriage?
   Yet another argument.  I think a sherrif huntin' down a wrassler would
use VHF Perception to decide how fast to ride up next to the wrassler's hoss
in erder ta jump onta it.

   Skill Factor:  Smithing?  What is a Smithing skill?  That is an artifact
of an underdeveloped skill factor in BT which is only used by NPC.  You know
as well as I do that if anyone wanted to play a smith, they would have to
take half a dozen skills in order to be competent.  Look at Todd's tailor.
Did he just have a Tailoring skill?  Look at the Jazz musicians.  Do we
just have Guitar or Piano skills?  "I don't _think_ so."
   Carpenters, Jewelers and Blacksmiths may skill have more in common than
other professions, but it is because they share a similar pool of skills.
For example, I would (and do in my system) make them all take Material
Appraisal and maybe a Design skill for creating new designs.  A blacksmith
understands what type of metal to use and how to treat it.  A carpenter has
a similar Lore skill for wood.  There is your similarity.
   I don't think, on the other hand, that all those deer hunters in Maine
(who may be good an hunting and tracking) are necessarily better than average
at blacksmithing or shoeing a horse.  I suspect that you were in a medieval
frame of mind when you wrote that, but that doesn't mean that your system
should be :-)
