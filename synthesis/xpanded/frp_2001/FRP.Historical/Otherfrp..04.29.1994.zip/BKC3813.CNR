Nowhere do I insist upon a finite scale.  Actually, I'd prefer to have an
open-ended scale.  Or better yet, a relativistic scale.  Say the average human
characteristic is locked at 100% and judge from there.  An average human would
have a Muscle score of 100, and a stronger person would have higher.  No
limits, except those constraints put on the race/character by the designer and
GM.

But can anyone think of a dice system for resolving relativistically scaled
attributes and skills?  =)

How would you prefer to limit the frequency and power of spells or other
magical effects?

Right!  I also prefer to leave out the concept of experience points.  XP are
too difficult to adjudicate fairly and consistently.  I prefer to use an
advancement system based upon critical successes and failures.

Every time a PC makes a critical success, he has the chance to improve that
skill or attribute by one or more points.  Ever critical failure has the chance
of lowering a skill or attribute.  This makes stats less, er, "static."  =)

Personally, I say leave the gods out of the game.  Maybe create some
"archetypes" for deities, much as the AD&D Complete Priests Guide does, but
don't make any specific pantheon part of the RPG.

Deities should be describable in the same manner as PCs -- stats and
personality.  Part of the "Grand Unification Theory of Gaming."

Again, I never insisted upon a finite scale.  A human might generally be
limited to a 1-79 range, and other beings might go up into the 146 range.  The
numbers don't matter; the system does.

The point I wanted to make is that the system should be as playable as possible
for as realistic as it is.  An inefficient system might be neither realistic or
playable...

I still think that game realism should be scalable, within bounds set by the
designer.  Certainly, no one who plays Toon really cares about weapon muzzle
velocities.


Interesting comments, Hades.  Let's try to keep this Design thread going!
