SUMMARY: 
Some waffle followed by a proposal.

THE WAFFLE:
Recently I had the opportunity to conduct a little roleplay
experiment. I managed to gather together a group of people who
had no previous roleplay experience and run a few different
scenarios and systems by them. The group was interesting; all
late 20's, mostly women; people I'd describe as imaginative and
expressive. The scenarios were in the political/ mystery vein
(i.e little combat).From these little experiments I managed to
draw some tenuous (and subjective) conclusions. To successfully
run this type of game;

1) The system has got to be really simple and intuitive (no
surprises here). In this type of naive one-off there's just not
the time to explain countless rules before a person can begin to
play their character. The victims attention span for roleplay far
exceeded their ability to digest rules. I started off by using
Prince Valiant, the simplest thing I own.

2) Some rules are important; the players like to feel that their
characters success/failure is in their hands, not mine
(regardless of the truth :^).

3) Combat turned out to be important. The standard wisdom
regarding combat systems in this type of game seems to go along
the lines "if you're running a political game keep the combat
system simple and abstract. Get the combat over quickly with few
dice rolls and get back to the important stuff". I found that
this wasn't necessarily the case.In my games, combat occurs
rarely and is used as a plot device either to provide variety,
build tension, or kill somebody :^). As their characters fate was
hanging in the balance the players wanted details, wanted to make
informed decisions, and wanted the outcome to be obviously
effected by these decisions. I also discovered that people,
especially under pressure, can be statistically naive. This means
that a +1 bonus to stat z, doesn't necessarily convert into a
perceived advantage to the player.

4) The old character knowledge/ player knowledge gap thingy. I
had the worlds greatest gardener playing the worlds greatest
swordswoman. I want narrative description in combat, not "I got
a 10, hum, -1 for strength,...I got a 9."

5) Words...words are good. Words encourage narrative, narrative
enhances roleplay. I switched to a loose FUDGE based system and
things improved dramatically. Having a player exclaim "I landed
a superb blow" really gets thing rolling (roleing?). Whole
sentences of narrative description are forthcoming. Numbers
seemed to encourage a passive response; player rolls, announces
number, and waits for me to spew a purple description. With word
based traits, they often do the description themselves. Less work
for me and a better sounding story. 

6) Numbers..numbers are bad. In the type of improvised narrative
thing I'm tying to create, numbers really blow the atmosphere.
I really noticed this in the FUDGElike game. Here we are cruising
along with GOOD, TERRIBLE and SUPERB actions and then...combat.
Suddenly it's all +1 bonuses, damage modifiers etc. Obviously
this is partly my fault, I could use the subjective systems
wherever possible. However, the players want at least the
illusion of objectivity, they just don't want all those yucky
numbers. They also seemed to prefer offense/ defense turns rather
than simultaneous combat. The simultaneous system seemed to them
to remove control.." I added up these numbers and threw a dice..I
lost.." while taking turns gave the sense of "He's about to land
a massive blow..time to parry..come on parry...whew." This
certainly added drama (especially for those players that knew
what a parry was :^). Remember that these people have never
played any system before, so this is not just an expression of
system preference or prejudice.

THE PROPOSAL:

Could you people help me design a card based, action point type
system? After a fortnight of playing with dice, adding numbers,
getting headaches and taking hot baths, I've concluded that this
sort of thing could alleviate the problems I've outlined above. 

In my minds eye, I can see a set of cards. Each card has a set
action on it "PARRY" etc. Beneath this is some sterling prose (a
sentence or 2) "You lift your weapon attempting to block the
incoming bow". At the bottom of the card are some numbers that
can be used to resolve the conflict, allocate damage etc.

I gather from a previous thread that there are several systems
out there that use cards and/or action points in their combat
systems. Mention has been made of Hero's of Olympus, Chivalry and
Sorcery, Lace and Steel, Torg's drama deck etc. I've had no
experience of any of these. Any highlights worth considering or
stealing? Details?

The advantage of this type of thing could be:

1) Combat becomes narrative.

2) The "knowledge gap" is bridged. Even if the player knows
nothing about swords, (s)he has a descriptive sentence to use.
This has got to be better than the "I got a 9" thing.

3) Subtle tactics are possible. Which option do I use? When?

4) Different genre's can be modelled with different cards. All
you need is the descriptions, some index cards and time.

5) Experience could be modelled in an interesting way. A
character gains "experience"; let them design a new card. They
could develop that signature combat manoeuvre no one else has.

OK, this has gone on way too long. Help me design it. I don't
propose this to be a replacement for FUDGE combat (or any other
system), just an alternative. 

Yours with RSI,

Murray

Yippee!  I actually have a small spot of time to waste posting to Usenet!  :)

Yes.  This is where Amber, IMHO falls massively short.  This point also
makes the difference between storytelling and roleplaying.  The amount
of rules is the difference between realistic roleplaying and (usually)
epic roleplaying.  Personally, I like realism.  My holy grail is the
most realistic roleplaying game known to man, but still playable.  :)

I find, too, that the greater the amount of role-play, the more detailed
a combat system should be.  This goes against most ideas, where people 
think that if a system (ie. combat system vs. skill system, not "game
system") is complex & lengthy, the game centers around it.  I think the
idea is that the more complex & lengthy, the more options the player has.
(In general, IMHO).

This, IMHO, can be done with any well-designed combat system.  Usually,
though, extensive rules have to be present to allow them.  AD&D does
NOT have an extensive combat system, so it's all one-hit, one-biff.
Most games don't do too well on this behalf, because of the myth that
the detail of the rules indicates the point of the game.

This is a really neat idea; of course, the GM would be under the 
pressure of having to allow it/not allow it, and it would probably
have to be a straight decision (ie. couldn't enforce upper/lower
limits on the power of the card).  But that's not bad, in my book.

The card idea is neat, if for no other reason than because it's
different, and I like to see new and different ideas.  Whether or
not it'll work is another matter.  I'd be happy to put my two cents
in whenever you need an opinion.  Unfortunately, school is putting a
lot of pressure on me for the next week (final projects & exams), and
then after that I've a week off, and then I'm effectively gone until
mid-January...
