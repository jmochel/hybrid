On the subject of our (un-)organization:

I strongly feel that we are going nowhere fast.  Everyone is throwing every
idea they have into the GMAST pool, and the pool is getting pretty chaotic.
I'm guilty of this, too, I know.

We need to work systematically.  Also, we do need to occasionally stop creating
and organize what we have.  A lot of ideas are being generated and discussed,
but it's hard to tell what we all agree on.

According to the man who knows, net votes don't work.  We don't need to make it
as complicated as all that anyway, but we do need to bend our own views to
accept the opinions of others.  If you don't want to compromise, steal ideas to
your heart's content, but don't force _your_ opinion down someone else's throat
until you bend a little yourself.

I've been trying to create a system that incorporates as many opinions as
possible without sacrificing the aspects that we agreed upon earlier.  I've
posted an Attributes message that is intended as a summary of the list's input.
I will continue to summarize and repost, and we can use that as our DIRECTION.

As a rule, every proposition should conform to the Guidelines we agree upon.
When it doesn't conform, you should explain why you chose to go in that
direction.

Everything you do should have a specific reason, or else you haven't thought it
through.  We are striving for a well thought-out game here.

We need to limit ourselves to the current point of discussion, whatever it is
at the time.  I posted a set of tentative Guidelines.  Attached is a proposed
Order of Business.  The items on the Order of Business should be attacked IN
ORDER, ONE AT A TIME.  Otherwise, the project degenerates into entropy with no
direction and no goal other than discussion.

Discussion is nice.  A few of us here probably have the experience and know-how
to take a lot of the ideas here and go make our own games, but we can produce a
better game if we work together.  The List is an excellent forum to test ideas
and see what the general gaming populace wants.  We can either just discuss
things and do our own individual games, or work together toward a COMMON GOAL
and produce a kick-ass game as a group project.

Let's work together on this, people.
