Subject:      RPG: Request and Question

First of all, I'd like to request that everyone do as little quoting as
possible in their letter.  By quoting, I mean implanting parts of others'
letters in their own to reply to them.  I am getting 10-page letters where the
writer writes only 5 pages, and the other parts are quotes that are replied to.
I think you should be able to state your comments with a simple name as a
directive, or a re-phrasing of their post in your own words.
Second of all, (this is to Adam Dray:) I think you're missing one thing (and
one thing only):  Where do YOU think we should determine our dice system?  I
agree with the people who think that that must be done early on.  I think that
the dice system should be set up at the same time (or right after) an attribute
system is set up, and before a skill system is set up.
Thirdly, a question:  Why does everyone hate formulas so much?  I enjoy
HEROSystem more than most RPGs just because it DOES have formulas.  I think
that a character should be able to take damage that can knock him/her our
without killing him/her.  This is reflected in HERO as Stun.  This attribute IS
based on a formula that includes both Constitution and Body (the amount of
damage that can be taken before death).  Many attributes, in my eyes, are based
on other attributes.  Sure, they can go above the base attribute, but they are
based on the base attribute score.
Fourth, I don't think the attribute system needs to be scaled.  I think that a
set of attributes, as long as it can be applied universally, is more than
adequate for the needs of any GMs.  I, too, enjoy lofty dreams, but I try to
stick to realistic, applicable goals.  I think that a scaled attribute system
is not very applicable for most RPGers.
Lastly, and this may be taken as sarcasm or a flame or anything else, but I
think that that the idea to create a game without attributes needs to be taken
one step further:  Don't create a game system - Instead, create a world and
have the GM be the supreme arbiter of what happens.  I have played in such a
game.  The GM determines what the chances are that the character succeeds in
what he/she is doing, and then determines whether it happens.  The GM acts as a
storyteller with the characters acting as characters in the tale.  The problem
with this is that the GM can force the characters too easily.  In the game that
I ran this way (for onee night), we were playing in Sanctuary, the city from
the Thieves' World anthology.  A thief-character wanted to climb a wall into
Prince Kadakathis' room.  I didn't want him there, so a guard post noticed him
(with good reason - he was using bear claws to help him climb, and they're not
that quiet).  They readied bows and both guards fired as he neared the top of
the wall.  One guard was lucky enough to hit the thief in the leg (the otehr
one missed) and did enough damage where he couldn't climb up any more, so he
dropped from the wall and ran...  If dice had been involved, would the thief
have been noticed?  Would the guards have hit?  We'll never know.  The point is
that these systems CAN work, but then you don't even need a game, just an
environment.  I think that we should stick to creating a GAME SYSTEM that will
work.
Thanks for your time,
-Brian
