Ooops, already forgot your name. In any case, the idea of having the
same stats for mind and body are interesting, but why not try this
way, instead? Have both the mind and body stats be 'real' stats, instead
of having the mind stats be 'knowledge,' which really should be dealt
with via skills, if anything.

So, you'd have Strength, Agility, and Health; for example, and you'd
have one each for the mind and for the body. A character could thus
be strong mentally (probably equivalent to a high wisdom), yet weak
physically; healthy body, weak mind, etc. If magic were allowed (and
I'd hope that it is!) the astral form would be a body with the mental
stats replacing the physical stats.

Mind Strength: sort of like wisdom; strength of character.
Mind Agility: sort of like intelligence; problem solving ability
Mind Health: strength of psyche; ability to withstand assaults on the mind,
             or insanities (sort of like POW, in CoC).

Or whatever; I'm not likely to get too involved in the list RPG, so
I hereby give all copyrights to this over to the list GMAST-L, forthwith,
soothwith, heckwith :*)
