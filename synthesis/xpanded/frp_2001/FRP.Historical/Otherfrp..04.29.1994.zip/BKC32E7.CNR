At the risk of introducing a game mecahnic ;), why not do the following.
Assume all characters automatically accrue a certain amount of xp/training
time per year.  Then, subtract an aging factor, and an experience factor,
the latter of which would be based on say the total number of skill levels
or the total of the five highest skills.

Example - You get 10 points towards attributes and and 40 points per skills
per year.  But, you are 35, so you lose 5 attribute points and 20 skill points
due to age.  Your five highest skills total to...lets see...uh..50.  We'll
divide that by 5, getting 10, so you lose 10 more skill points simply maintain-
ing your proficiency, leaving you with 5 attribute points and 10 skill points.

An older character would have negative numbers, and would have to get other
xp/training simply to maintain themselves, which would get harder and harder.

The biggest advantage is that characters only have to worry about it once
per year.  How's it sound?
