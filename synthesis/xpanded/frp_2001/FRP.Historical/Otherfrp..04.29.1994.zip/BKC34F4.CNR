    Ok, so this is good. I mean really good. I like the way it takes an old
method of resolution and turns things around a little. It might take a
little getting used to concept wise. I'm sure that most people could handle
rolling under their skill or attirbute score, but the idea of rolling
differnet numbers of dice for different levels of difficulty might need
some mental adjusting too.

    Well, I suppose the only question I have about this so far, is how do
we control the increase of skills under this system? Would the player
always roll the highest number of dice (6d6) to see if a skill or attribute
increased? This is kind of a logical solution, since that is the only way
to increase a score beyond 30 to the maximum of 36, but if 36 is no the
maximum (still working for the open-ended system) then how do you decide
what to roll for skill increase?

    Just picking a nit here, but the % values that you use are for a skill
level of 9 and not 10...
