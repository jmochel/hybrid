        Well, since so many people seem to be interested in putting
together a Public-Domain Role-Playing Game, I herewith submit my
proposal for Character Statistics.
        I won't bother to describe my reasons for choosing these, but
let it suffice to say that I have some...

PHYSICAL:

Strength
        Brute force.

Constitution
        Durability, or the reliability of a body. Could also be
considered "Endurance." Resistance to poison and sickness would fall
under this heading.

Dexterity
        Physical finesse, or the ability to perform delicate actions
regardless of one's bulk.

MENTAL:

Reckoning
        Computational ability, or the ability to generalize and
extrapolate. For example, if a player sees a bizarre artifact and wants
to figure out what its purpose might be, Reckoning would be the skill
that correlates the various features and comes up with a reasonable
guess.

Knowledge
        Raw information stored in brain. People who are good at trivia
games probably have a good Knowledge score. Could also be considered
Experience. Reckoning and Knowledge are interdependent in many cases.

Instinct
        This could be considered as many things: intuition, creativity,
"holistic thinking." Instinct allows people to occasionally choose the
right path without being able to justify their actions rationally; of
course, it also occasionally encourages them to screw up in a horrible
way.

METAPHYSICAL

Passion
        This is a person's _lebenslust_, or "passion for life." It is
the ability to find meaning in life, even if -- or _especially_ if --
the character believes there is no _objective_ meaning. Could also be
interpreted as "Charisma" -- it's not quite the same thing but there's a
high correlation.

Willpower
        The degree to which a person can defer short-term satisfaction
in favor of long-term goals. Note that a person with high Willpower may
still very well do things which _seem_ to be "giving in to temptation";
the cause of such actions is, in actuality, a belief that the temptation
is irrelevant or offers more benefits than are readily apparent. For
example, a high-Willpower person may view forbidden pleasures not as a
means to "escape reality" but as a means to explore his consciousness,
to test himself, or simply to "play the odds" that even if he does
suffer harm from his actions, he would've suffered it at some other
point anyway, but from a less pleasant source.

Self
        A person's reliance on his own judgment; independence from the
"herd instinct." Individualism. This is, of course, the key skill for
any great leader.


        Let me know what you think...

                                                Guy T.
