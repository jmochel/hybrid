"It should never be forgotten that without some foundation of reality,
science fiction would be impossible, and that therefore exact
knowledge is the friend, not the enemy, of imagination and fantasy."

- Arthur C. Clarke quoted in 
  _The Writer's Guide to Creating a Science Fiction Universe_
  (see bibliography at the end of this posting)

In my original posting on what I felt was wrong with SF, I stated that
I feel that many existing games were badly researched and that an
author should know enough about science, etc. so that he or she will
at least know what he or she is changing.  Below are excerpts and a
list of books that influenced my opinion about this (or in some cases,
books that I simply felt were very useful for creating an SF setting).
They are primarily sources about writing science fiction stories and
books or informative texts but they contain information that is also
useful in a gaming and setting design context.  Any misspelling are 
probably my fault...

Jerry Pournelle's comments on plausible "might happen" "realistic" SF
from "Building Future Worlds" in _Writing & Selling Science Fiction_
(see bibliography):

On _Technological Consistency_: 

"[...]
	If a writer knows no science, he'd better admit it and get
some advice from someone who does.  There is not excuse for some of
the stupidities that get into SF stories.
	Sure: science fiction is fiction about science.  We are
permitted inventions now thought impossible, and technical
achievements now now expected.  But we are not permitted just any old
invention or achievement; there is a logic to these things.  The most
far-out science is still science, not fantasy.  Expect for the
specifics assumed for the story, the rest of the universe should be
left alone.  Certain inventions force certain developments, and that
logic must be maintained; but we must not assume that in science
fiction all bets are off and everything is permitted. 
[...]
	There's no reason to think we know everything, of course;
surely there's more to be discovered than we've already found out.
But if a story does postulate a reactionless drive, it should also
postulate some pretty strange physical effects.  We have here a gadget
that somehow exerts a force in a way entirely different from anything
we've ever imagined.  Consistency demands that we use it for more than
just spaceships.
[...]
	Technological consistency is at bottom a matter of having a
feel for the sciences; of knowing enough about various disciplines
such as physics, chemistry, and biology to be able to distinguish
between inventions that _develop_ from present theories and those that
overthrow them; and having made the distinction, dealing appropriately
with each type.  The rocket ship, for example, embodies no physics not
known in Newton's time; an engineer with the right tools and materials
could have built the Apollo capsule a hundred years ago.  Atomic
energy, on the other hand, requires basic new theories; atom bombs are
not even possible in nineteenth century physics." [excerpt from pp 94-97]

On Social Structures:

"	The motivations of the characters depend on their backgrounds,
and the backgrounds cannot seem impossible to the reader.  This means
that an SF writer has to do some hard thinking.  Just how much of
human motivation stems from our social order?  From half-remembered
commands such as 'Thou Shalt Not Steal," and "Honor Thy Father and Thy
Mother"?  From the universal brotherhood that is at least implied by
Christianity, so that we at least feel guilty about thinking of
another human being as 'fair game,' an object, a thing, a victim?
	There is a lot of inconsistent nonsense presented as science
fiction, and many of the inconsistencies come from failure to think
about the problem of human motivation.  If the society described (or
assumed) in the story is brutal and ugly and rejects bourgeois
morality, how can characters continue to act as if they'd grown up in
Searcy, Arkansas?
[...]
	Building a consistent future is hard work; so hard that many
SF writers, including myself, sketch out the social order before we
even attempt the story.  Is courage a virtue in this future world?
Are there virtues at all?  Why?  What do men and women strive for, and
to the sexes have the same goals?  And it is no good throwing together
a batch of social assumptions at random, either.  Although each may be
logical in that some trend in that direction can be seen in today's
world, the total effect may be utterly inconsistent.  A social order
must hang together; if it is too ugly, or provides no motivation for
people to keep it together, it will fall apart and something else will
take its place.  There have been revolutionaries in every society;
most revolutions fail; but unless there are at least _some_ defenders
of the social order, it is doomed.  A society can endure the
indifference of many of its members, but not of all of them; it can
endure a number of contradictions, but give it too many and it won't
last long enough to write a story about it.
[...a discussion of the semi-cyclic nature of history omitted...]
	When you write about social orders of the future, you are
bound to be controversial because you are writing about politics.  A
militant democrat will reject stories about future Empires because he
believes that Democracy is on the march and inevitably must triumph;
writers who say something else can work just as well are challenging
his beliefs.  Oddly enough it is less controversial to postulate
future dictatorships, fascist states, and truly ugly societies than it
is to postulate some kind of tranquil aristocratic state.  I suspect
this is because in ugly societies the characters generally burn with
revolutionary fervor -- and if they don't, the ought to! -- whereas in
stories of future Empire, the populace is generally reasonably happy.
Those who believe ininevitable 'progress' can be persuaded that
something has sidetracked the millennium -- but not that there never
was and never will be a perfect social order.
	Feminists become enraged when SF stories assume that there has
been a turn of the wheel and renewed emphasis on different roles for
the different sexes.  Atheists do a slow burn if a story shows
religious people in a future era.  And so forth.
[...]
	There are no set rules for building a logical and consistent
future society.  Indeed, the ability to do that job is one of the
prerequisites for becoming a science fiction writer, and if you don't
understand what I'm talking about here, perhaps some other line of
work would be more congenial.
	Yet societies condition and change human motivations, and
unless one has some feel for human motivations, it is unlikely that he
can be a writer at all, whether SF or mainstream.  Thus the SF writer
needs some feel for history and sociology, or else he best stick to
societies he knows and not dream up new ones.  This has been the
failure of some of the most scientific of SF writers; even the hardest
technical 'idea' story requires some attention to social details, and
without that the story is unbelievable.  On the other hand, some of
the finest science fiction has been purely sociological." 
[excerpt from pp 97-105]

find it, read the whole thing.]

Gardner Dozois' comments on good and bad SF from "Living the Future:
You Are What You Eat" from _Writing Science Fiction and Fantasy_ (see
bibliography):


"
[...Gardner Dozois' description of "1950's syndrome" omitted.  I think
you can "get it" from the name and context...]
	Well, after all, science fiction is pretty easy to write,
isn't it?  It's just a matter of using fancy names -- just change the
names, apply a thin layer of technologese and jargon, right?  Say
"helicar" instead of car, "helipad" instead of driveway, "tri-vid"
instead of television, "feelies" (or "smellies" or "grabbies") instead
of movies.  Better still, use the word "space" as a prefix for
everything:  spacesuit, spacegun, spacehelmet, spacehouse, spacedog,
spacecow....Right?  Just change the names and you can write a
confession-magazine love story, a cowboy story, a gothic, or a nurse
novel, and sell it as science fiction.  Right?
	Wrong.
	There's no better way to ensure that your story will not sell.
Stories deeply tainted by the 1950 Syndrome are not science fiction;
they do not do what science fiction should do -- they are swindles.
They are thin and transparent frauds that are almost automatically
rejected by nearly every SF editor in the business.  Even the most
routine hack space opera demands and delivers more.  They are duds,
the unsalable lowest denominator of the slush pile.

Why do people of intelligence and talent turn out Syndrome stories
when they first try their hand at writing science fiction?
	Because of tunnel-vision.  Because they know no better.
Because they have not learned to unleash, discipline, and control
their imaginations.  Because they simply have not been taught to look
at a future society as a _real_,_self-consistent_,_and_organic_thing_.
[...]
	Thus, the layman, the one unfamiliar with the genre.  But even
the more habitual science fiction reader may fare no better.  In fact,
he is often more susceptible to the Syndrome, and may well be worse
off than the layman -- in addition to comics and the visual media, he
must also cope with the sediment laid down by years of reading bad
pulp space opera.  This is why, twenty-five years or more after
they've ceased to be commercially viable, the same old stock SF
gimmicks, cousin-german to the 1950 Syndrome stories, continue to
march needlessly across editorial desks:  vast Galactic Empires and
the intrepid secret agents who single-handedly overthrow them;
Bug-Eyed Monsters who lust after beautiful ladies; interstellar
armadas banging away at each other so unimaginatively that you can
almost hear the sails flapping.  Stories wherein, in Harry Harrison's
words, "Bright young things voyage out from Earth in miraculous ships
that get anywhere in a flash, to alien planets with oxygen atmospheres
where exotically-shaped aliens talk colloquial English and think
exactly like their American counterparts...."  Kurt Vonnegut's Eliot
Rosewater complains that science fiction writers "write about
Earthlings all the time, and they're all Americans.  Practically
nobody on Earth is an American."  Damon Knight asks, "Where is the
space hero who is an Indian from India, or a black African, or a
Maylay or a Chinese, or -- all right, let's not ask too much -- where
is the hero who is Italian?"
	Why aren't there different kinds of people and different ways
of thought out among the stars?  Why is the future 1950?  Why doesn't
anything _new_ happen in these stories?  Because bad fiction
perpetuates itself, and stifles the imagination that might otherwise
revitalize or replace it.
[...]
	_Everything_ changes:  this is the central philosophic vision
of good science fiction; if you cannot adjust to it, cannot believe
it, cannot _feel_ it and see it in everything around you and in
yourself, then you're wasting your time trying to write the stuff.
	Nothing is simple.  Everything changes.  Things connect.
	You are what you eat.
	And want, and do, and think, and fear, and dream.
	You live in an organic surround, an interlocking and
interdependent gestalt made up of thousands of factors and
combinations thereof:  cultural, technological, biological,
psychological, historical, environmental.  For all practical purposes,
you _are_ that surround; if the things that make up that surround are
altered, then you will be altered with them.
[...]
	To write good SF, then, you must learn to perceive the hidden
relationships that most do not; to pinpoint the trends just emerging
in the present that might become prominent in the future, and to
extrapolate logically their results in fictional terms, in terms of
what they mean to people.  
[...]
	Remember that science fiction depicts not only new
technologies and societal trends and their effects, but also how they
cause people to react to _each_other_.
[...]
	Be aware that wild factors can upset the most impeccably
logical timetables.  Hardly anyone foresaw the incredible acceleration
of technological advance since WWII, or the mass cultural/
psychological nervous breakdown of the late sixties.  If your
fictional scenario is exceedingly neat and tidy, perhaps you'd better
throw in some wild factors, mess it up a little, make it more like the
confusion in which we usually live." [excerpt from pp 13-21]

[See also Jane Yolen's comments on consistency in fantasy in "Turtles
All the Way Down" also in _Writing Science Fiction and Fantasy_]

Stanley Schmidt's comments on good and bad SF from "Good Writing Is
Not Enough" from _Writing Science Fiction and Fantasy_ (see
bibliography):

"
[...Following a discussion of some science in a story...]
	'But I can't do that,' you may say.  'You're talking about
_calculation_, and I'm a writer, not a mathematician."  Sorry; you
_must_ do that, to the extent that you can, and get help when you need
it.  You don't have to be a professional scientist or engineer; few
stories need as much background calculation as _Lifeboat Earth_.  But
if you want to write real science fiction, and not fantasy or westerns
with spaceships, you must check the consequences of your assumptions
and see whether they work and what side effects they have.
	How can you develop solid scientific backgrounds if you're not
a scientist?  Learn all you can about everything.  Take courses -- but
don't depend on them.  Learn to teach yourself.  Read widely.  Basic
physics, chemistry, astronomy, and biology are essential.  Virtually
anything else will sooner or later prove useful:  geology, psychology,
anthropology, history, linguistics -- the more the merrier.  Use
_recent_ books, and don't stop there.  These fields change rapidly
(astronomy has changed more in the last twenty years than in the
preceding four hundred.)  Watch the tip of the iceberg, at least, in
magazines like _Scientific American_ and _New Scientist_.  All this
reading serves not only as a safeguard against unworkable story ideas,
but also as a source of good ones.  Knowing where the present limits
of knowledge are will suggest what lies beyond.
[...]
	Does all this mean that you must prove rigorously that
everything you write about is possible, and that you must avoid things
not covered by present-day science?  Not at all.  Science has changed
radically just in this century; it would be arrogant and unrealistic
to assume we're not due for more big surprises.  A fundamental
breakthrough, by definition, cannot be deduced from existing theories.
I use the "negative impossibility" criterion:  anything that nobody
can currently prove impossible is fair game for science fiction.  For
example, faster-than-light travel (FTL) is okay _if_ you postulate it
in a form that doesn't contradict existing theory in any region of
experience that has been thoroughly tested experimentally -- even
though it would surely require radical changes in theory outside the
tested range.  Several of my own stories, including _Lifeboat Earth_,
have used a form of FTL in which objects can "tunnel" to a superlight
speed without an increase in energy, while objects traveling below
the speed of light act just as Einstein said they do.  (The resulting
consternation among theoretical physicists becomes part of the story
background.)  Other writers have used scientific rationales ranging
from "hyperspace" (a shortcut through a dimension not normally
perceived by humans, as in John W. Campbell's _The Mightiest Machine_
and Robert A. Heinlein's _Starman Jones_) to a new kind of force that
increases with the mass it is accelerating (as in Norman Spinrad's
"Outward Bound").
	Psychic talents, like the Bergmann surgery in "A Touch
Beyond," are a somewhat special case.  Parapsychological phemonmena
such as telepathy and telekinesis are highly controversial in the
scientific community.  Some scientists thing their existence is well
enough established that further research on them is not only
worthwhile but important, though the underlying mechanisms are not yet
even remotely understood.  Others dismiss everything that's been done
on the subject as sloppy or fraudulent and deny that there's any real
evidence that the phenomena exist at all.  For science fiction, if you
accept my negative impossibility test, it doesn't matter whether "psi"
phenomena have be proved to exist or not.  If you portray them as
something that _could_ exist, in a way that is self-consistent and
does not contradict scientific knowledge that _is_ well established,
they are perfectly legitimate subjects for science fiction.  But you
do have to put them on a reasonably scientific basis -- if not
providing a detailed explanation for them, at least making sure they
operate according to consistent rules.  An occult or "anything goes"
approach will not do".  [excerpt from pp 95-98]

World Builder's Handbook and Pocket Companion" in _Writing Science
Fiction and Fantasy_ on how to build a believable star system.]

_Writing Science Fiction and Fantasy_ on creating believable aliens.]

John Barnes' comments on near future societies from "How to Build a
Future" from _Writing Science Fiction and Fantasy_ (see bibliography):

"
[...]
	Think about what most fictional planets are like.  The writer
who doesn't worldbuild usually creates the familiar in drag:  a singe,
excerpted environment.  Jungle planets, ice planets, or desert worlds
are usually just the Amazon, Antarctica, or the Kalahari without the
research or detail a story actually set in those places requires.
	Not merely limited in variety, they all seem to be the size of
Chicago, or at best Georgia.  Jerry Pournelle has aptly described this
with the phrase 'It was raining on Mongo that morning.'  Though SF
writers claim to explore the wonder and vastness of the Universe, many
forget that a planet is _big_.  The Earth includes places as diverse
as the Grand Canyon, the Black Sea, the Pacific atolls, Greenland, and
the Mid-Atlantic Ridge.  Yet, how often are we told that some planet
is a 'steamy jungle world' or a 'polar waste?' (So what's Earth -- a
'room temperature world with an oxygen-rich, water-saturated
atmosphere?'  Tell that to a poor tourist dropped off, wearing only
his bathing suit, in the Whichaway Nunataks of Qattara Depression.)
[...]
	What's true of physical environments is true of social ones.
How many versions of the Roman Empire, the high feudal period, or
Tokugawa Japan, are there in SF?  Just as many SF writers invent
familiar environments, they also invent familiar history.
	This does have the advantage that everything 'goes together'
-- a first-century polity with a first-century economy and society
automatically has some plausibility.  (So do crocodile-like reptiles
on jungle planets.)
[...]
	You also get the social equivalent of it raining on Mongo that
morning.  Just as we forget that there are a lot of very different
places on a planet, we forget that a lot of different things happen in
a century.  When John D. Rockefeller was born, the last Revolutionary
War veterans were still alive; when he died Neil Armstrong was seven
years old.  Thomas Jefferson lived through one-quarter of the
nineteenth century, Thomas Edison more than half of it -- that same
century contained clipper-ship races, the experimental development of
radio, the Romantic movement in music and literature, the birth of
modern advertising, Greek Revival and Victorian Gothic, the canal era,
Freud's early work, Lewis and Clark, Impressionism, the 1848
revolutions in Europe, the opening of Japan, and the first hints of
atomic energy.  
	Yet many science-fictional future histories have less
happening between now and 3000 than actually happened between A.D. 900
and 1200.  Often, in SF, social change seems to have arrested anywhere
from ten to fifty years after the present, technological change a
century at most." [excerpt from pp 146-148]

[The rest of this essay goes into a VERY detailed discussion of
creating a near future setting and is a MUST READ for anyone
attempting such a task themselves...]

[See also Norman Spinrad's essay on "Building a Starfaring Age" also
in _Writing Science Fiction and Fantasy_ on far futures]

There are a lot of books out there on writing SF fiction.  They have a
lot of good suggestions in them for making your SF better.  In
particular:

_Writing and Selling Science Fiction_, The Science Fiction Writers of
America, Writers Digest Books, Cincinnati OH, 1982, ISBN 0-89879-079-4
(NOTE: This book is probably out of print -- look in used book stores)

This is an EXCELLANT book on the SF Genre.  Essays of interest to
gamers include "Where Do You Get Those Crazy Ideas?" by James Gunn,
"Nomenclature in Science Fiction" by Poul Anderson, "Building Future
Worlds: Logic and Consistency in the Craft of Science Fiction" by 
Jerry Pournelle, "Living the Future: You Are What You Eat" by Gardner
Dozois, "Who's Going to Run Things in Twenty-Three Hundred?  And How
Are They Going to Do It?" by Tom Purdom, and the all important
"First, Sew on a Tentacle (Recipes for Believable Aliens)" by George
R. R. Martin.  Many of these essays are most valuable in that they
tell you what NOT to do if you want to create good SF.

_Writing Science Fiction_, Christopher Evans, St. Martin's Press
(first published in the U.K. by A&C Black Ltd), New York, 1988,
ISBN 0-312-01849-5 (NOTE: Printing Status Unknown)

This is a more conventional writing book with chapters of interest to
gamers on "The Scope of Science Fiction", "Ideas", and "The Anatomy of
a Story".  The book has a good concise list of plots NOT to use...

_How to Write Science Fiction and Fantasy_, Orson Scott Card, Writer's
Digest Books, Cincinnati OH, 1990, ISBN 0-89879-416-1 
(NOTE: Still in print -- available from Writer's Digest Book Club)

A more writing oriented book with some valuable ideas on how to
generate plots, etc.  Chapters of interest to gamers include "The
Infinite Boundary" (What IS Science Fiction, etc.), "World Creation"
and "Story Construction".

_Writing Science Fiction and Fantasy_, by the Editors of Analog and
Asimov's Science Fiction, St. Martin's Press, New York, 1991, 
ISBN 0-312-08926-0 (NOTE: Still in print to my knowledge)

Considering that parts of this book first appeared in Analog, this is
certainly one of the more technical of the writing books.  Essays of
interest to gamers include a reprint of "Living the Future: You Are
What You Eat" by Gardner Dozois, "Turtles All the Way Down" (on
consistancy) by Jane Yolen, "Good Writing Is Not Enough" (on common
mistakes in SF) by Stanley Schmidt, "The Creation of Imaginary Worlds:
The World Builders Handbook and Pocket Companion" (technical with
discussion of spectral classes, etc) by Poul Anderson, "The Creation
of Imaginary Beings" by Hal Clement, "How to Build a Future" (VERY
detailed with discussions of using spreadsheets for simulations)
by John Barnes, "Building a Starfaring Age" by Norman Spinrad, and
the all important "Ideas that Wouldn't Die" (again, what NOT to do)
by Stanley Schmidt.  There are other essays on writing by Isaac Asimov
and Robert A. Heinlein.

_The Writer's Guilde to Creating a Science Fiction Universe_, George
Ochoa and Jeffrey Osier, Writer's Digest Books, Cincinnati OH, 1993,
ISBN 0-89879-536-2 (NOTE: Available through Writer's Digest Book Club)

This is an excellent overview of the science involved in writing
science fiction.  This book is a MUST for people weak in that area.
It includes chapters on "The Sun and the Planets", "Starships", 
"Around the Galaxy", "Designing a Planet", "A Case Study of a
Lifebearing Planet", "Aliens", "Galactic Civilizations",
"Nanotechnology and Virtual Reality", "Designing a Future",
"Intelligent Machines", "Remodeling Humans", "Future Shocks", and
"Alternate Universes".  This book provides rough overviews of
each area delving a little deeper where necessary.  The focus seems
to be more towards "hard" near-future SF here although all areas
are covered for the most part.

There is another Writer's Digest Book on SF titled (I've misplaced mine):

_How to Write Tales of Horror, Fantasy, & Science Fiction_, J.N.
Williamson ed. -- Writer's Digest Book Club #10245

"In 27 detailed, informative chapters of expert advice and
instruction, the most successful writers in these genres explain the
fundamentals important to all good fiction in these genres, from
research and setting, to creature/monster development and plotting."
says the blurb in The Writer's Digest Book Club flyer...

OTHER RECOMMENDED MATERIAL:

_The New Age Baby Name Book_, Sue Browder, Warner Books, New York,
1987, ISBN 0-446-32004-8

A GREAT inexpensive source of non-Anglo names for games of all sorts.

_The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Language_, David Crystal, Cambridge
University Press, Cambridge, 1987, ISBN 0-521-42443-7

Perhaps the best linguistics and language overview book I've seen.
It covers just about everything.

_Beyond The Limits_, Donella H. Meadows (and others), Chelsea Green
Publishing Co., Post Mills VT, 1992, ISBN 0-930031-55-5 

This book is excellant not in that it describes the danger of an
impending global collapse but in that it describes in detail all of
the factors involved in a global socio-economic-ecological system.
Included is an in depth discussion of the famous World3 global
systems model and information of where to obtain the model and
the software to run it. 

_The Writer's Complete Crime Reference Book_, Martin Roth, Writer's
Digest Books, Cincinnati OH, 1990, ISBN 0-89879-397-1

A good overview of the US legal system, crimes, and crime
investigation.  There are other books in this series on death, 
poisons, and weapons.

SPECIAL NOTE:

The Writer's Digest Book Club has extensive ads of it's books in, of
all places, _The Writer's Digest_, a montly magazine of writing.  

ADDITIONAL SUGGESTIONS:

Textbooks dealing with Astronomy, History, and Geography will also be
helpful.  

NOTE:  All ISBNs probably reflect those for the U.S. edition.
       Editions from other countries may be identified differently

I hope some of you find all of this helpful...
