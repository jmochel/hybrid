Subject: Info on Learning

Probably nothing new here for you guys, but figured I'd slide 
it by.  



This comes from the USVBA newsletter, in an article about
coaching.  The information is what was gathered and used
by the 1984,88,92 Mens Olympic Volleyball Teams.  Mainly
the efforts of Carl McGown, Doug Beal, Bill Neville
and Marv Dunphy.

Current Literature on Teaching Methods  

-Humans have a limited ability to process information.
Therefore, perfomance at all levels of learning can be facilitated
by reducing the amont of information to be processed.

-The group of subjects who received the most complete instruction
made strikingly little improvement. (Renshaw and Postle)

-Words have little menaing for the beginner in motor skills.
(Berlin)

-Movement information is retained in short term memory
in the form of an image. (Marteniuk)

-I was beginning to learn what all good teachers must learn;
that images are better than words, showing better than
telling, too much instruction worse than none at all.
(Gallwey)

-Most tasks are learned at a faster rate when repeated
demonstrations are shown. (MacCoby and Sheffield)

-Learners may attend to as many task irrelevant as 
relevant cues when their attention is not directed.
(Yando, Seitz, and Ziegler)

-Verbal cues by the model enhance learnign and serve
four important functions.  They: a) condense information
b) reduce words, c)encourage slecetive attention
d) enhance memory.  (Weiss)

-It is no longer possible to justify the concept of 
unitary abilities such as coodination and agility since the evidence 
shows that these abilities are specific to the task or activity.
(Bachman)

-The results agree with the theory that transfer is highly
specific and occurs only when the practiced movements are 
identical. (Lindeburg)

-There has been a great deal of research conducted concerning 
transfer from one variation of a task to another variation
of the same task.  One is forced to conclude that the amount
of motor transfer is quite small. (Schmidt)

-Progression is a near sacred principle in physical education
and is taken most seriously in teacher education.  Evidence
indicatesd the faith may be misplaced. . .progressions generally
appear not to be significant factors inlearning many motor
skills. (Nixon and Locke)

-In the 30 whole-part studies reviewed, not one showed superiority
for experimental treatments involving part or progressive
part methods of study.  In the majority of studies some 
permutation of the whole method was associated with superior learning.
(Nixon and Locke)

-Variable practice involves intentional variations of a given task and 
compared to a constant practice, where only a single variant is 
practiced, facilitates retention and generalizability (ed. Argh!) 
particularily to a novel situation whose specific variant has not 
been received prior to practice. (Schmidt)
