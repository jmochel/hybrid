\chapter{Buying Skills and Advantages}

\section{Outline}

In the previous portion of the character generation process we added 
and subtracted points to four ``pools''. These four pools : Stats, 
Skills, Wealth, and Status are the basis of the final resolution of 
the character's skills, history, etc \dots

The four pools each have a different basic function.

The Statistics pool or ``Stat'' pool, serves as the point pool for 
increasing a PC statistics or creating special abilities.

The Skill pool is the repository of points to be spent in gaining 
skills.

The Wealth pool contains points to be spent in gaining an idea of 
basic financial state.

The Status pool contains points to be spent in gaining all the 
possible trappings of status. Reputation, syncophants.

Players do have a limited amount of lateral movement for these 
points. The Wealth and Status pool can exchange to a maximum of EDU/2
The Statistics and Skill pools can exchange a maximum of EDU/2 
points.

In addition a player can add and subtract to/from the pools by the 
usage of Advantages and Disadvantages.
