\chapter{ Creation of Handcrafted Items}

\section{Intro}

Creating items such as songs and computer programs is a simple enough 
process. Once the Ef of the creation is decided, the skill roll is 
made3 and the effects tallied. If the SN has some sort of critical 
effect then the object created is considered to be an object of 
quality. For each category of critical effect the created object is 
considered to be at one higher rank for usage.

\begin{quotation}

A programmer is creating a debugger, He rolls and gets a 1.5 times 
effect. The debugger is at rank +1. So anyone working with the 
debugger adds 1 rank to his rank when debugging. AN unranked 
individual acts as if he is ranked 0.
