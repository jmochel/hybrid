With the Kawa development team's help, I was able to run WebLogic Server
under the debugger.  The procedure described below assumes that your
JDK is installed in %JAVA_SDK% (g:\jdk1.2.2 on chiswick).

    1.  First, you must download and install JPDA (Java Platform Debugging
        Architecture) 1.0 from Sun.  Under both Solaris and Win32, this
        package is compatable with JDK 1.2 and higher.

        I've got a copy of this download in \\CHISWICK\I\jpda1_0-win.zip
        Extract the contents of this archive into %JAVA_SDK%.

    2.  Run debugWebLogic.cmd.  It will produce several lines of output, then
        the JVM will suspend waiting for a debugger connection.

    3.  Next, download the latest changes from Source Safe.  Minimally, you
        should pick up a new version of the Spider.kwx workspace, and a new
        project (Cmd\WebLogicDebug.kpx).

    4.  Start Kawa and configure it for remote debugging:

         a.  Open the WebLogicDebug project.

         b.  Under Customize | Options | Directories | Advanced Paths,
             enable the check box for "JVMDI  Debug".

	     Under Project | Interpreter Options | Advanced make sure the system 
             in "Remote Debugging Host" is set to "-host localhost -port 7081".

         c.  Start the Kawa debugger using F5 or Build | Debug | Run.
             The WLS session you started earlier in the DOS window should
             resume its startup.

         d.  Once WLS startup completes, use Kawa to set your breakpoints.
             You may not need to wait, but I haven't had an opportunity yet
             to experiment with alternate procedures.

   5.  Start your WLS client (i.e. Netscape or a command-line client) in
       another window.  If necessary, you can start a second Kawa session
       run your client under the debugger.
