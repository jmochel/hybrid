actually it makes sense to have some form of mixing within the troops.  That
is the basis for a combined arms type of attack.  However there should be
little if any mixing within each phalanx, they should be homogeneous.  But
why not attach a few different phalanx's and call it a unit that acts togther?

I do agree with Geoff on the DEF of the creatures, Dave you people play a
very potent version of the game, I think that instead of having such high
armor you should boost up the damage resistance of the creatures.  That would
be more "were-like" too.
