I would think that mixing creatures in units like that would (1) cause
discipline/morale problems and (2) negate some of creatures' special
abilities (for example, the bats would be unable to fly without
leaving the unit, which is a no-no). It seems to me that most of the
time it would be better to make small units for each creature type and
them have them travel & fight together, but as separate units. The big
exception that comes up a lot is pole weapons in the back ranks, but
the soldiers usually have the same stats.

Good god! 10 DEF is 2 higher than the best FH armor, and 20 makes you
impervious to any BODY unless you've got 3 1/2d6 or better. I think
your GM should put limits on DC and defenses, or there's going to be
trouble. For fantasy characters, defenses are much much too cheap in
HERO.
