    I think that use of the dualistic model as a starting point is okay,
but it may be time to drop the cateogries becasue they seem redundant, and
mmay even be confusing. Some people might not ba able to see the
correlation between mental grace and empathy.

> Muscle (P)       |  pure physical power

    There might be some problems with expressing muscle density/mass and
muscle tone. If you are trying to represent physical power why not call the
stat Power and be done with it (Basis)?

> Health (P)       |  body's ability to repair itself

    I'm not sure what I would use, but Health seems a little bland a term
for me here. I don't have a real problem with it, it's just bland.

> Endurance (P)    |  ability to take damage and pain

    This is also the degree to which you can physically exert yourself.

> Quickness (P)    |  quickness of muscle (not reaction time!)

    Um... Where did this come from, and what happened to reflex?

> Grace (P)        |  efficiency and beauty of motion

    I think that Agility is probably a better name. If you like please leve
the category name as Grace, but I see physical grace as Agility.

> Sanity (M)       |  mental stability and capacity

    Are you planning on using this mental capacity as memory? It is very
possible for a person to be insane yet posses a photographic memory. I
don't see the need to have a stat that deals with the mental stability of
the character. Capacity I think is very important, but not necessarily
stability.

> Willpower (S)    |  strength of character and mental fortitude

    You see Willpower as a Social attribute? Then how can it account for
mental fortitude? I think you have a typo here in your clasification of
Willpower.

> (  P Physical     M Mental       S Social  )

    I'm not so sure that it is important for there to be a distinction
for social attributes. Most "social" skills can be learned, and many of the
social attributes that you have could be seen as either physical attributes
or mental attributes depending on how they are played. I see them as adding
to social skills, but not really needing their own classification.
