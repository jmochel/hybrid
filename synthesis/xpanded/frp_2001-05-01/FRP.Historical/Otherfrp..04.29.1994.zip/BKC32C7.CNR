Sean A. Reith mentioned Hero Points, as taken from James Bond RPG (or so he
thought).  Sean:  I love the idea!  I am going to toss that into my HEROSystem
game.  We used to play that at the end of the night a player vote was taken on
who the best role-player of the night was.  That person got a free XP (these
did mount up, cuz the best roleplayer was usually one of two guys...).
Instead, I can give a free Hero Point or two, and let them use them when things
are darkest.  Thanks for the fantastic idea!
        Sean also asked for a system to work clerics in a skill-based system so
that they are not simply misinformed mages.  I use the HEROSystem (as everyone
here probably already knows) where all spell casting requires a skill roll
modified by the difficulty of the spell (as expressed by the cost).  I require
wizards' spell casting roll based on Intelligence (or the equivalent in your
game would work - Reasoning, etc.), and I force priests to use Ego (or Wisdom,
or Willpower, etc) for their skill roll.  This represents, IMHO, the priests
mental strength to channel the power of a deity.  Deities usually play an
inactive role, EXCEPT within the upper echelons of their church (most are
fairly active there - through dreams and the like) and only grant spells to
priests as an afterthought.  Most spells, if mis-cast, have a side-effect that
harms the caster - the power of the deity was too much and the priest is
injured.  Higher power, or higher level, spells don't have side-effects because
the Deity pays more attention when they're cast and makes sure that even if the
priest is not capable of handling the power at that time, s/he isn't injured.

Is this the kind of idea you were looking for?  I hope so.
