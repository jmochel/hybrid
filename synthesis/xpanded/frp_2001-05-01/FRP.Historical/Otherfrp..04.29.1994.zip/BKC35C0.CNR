   I think the RPG creation is a good idea and I wouldnt mind reading posts
about it.  But I think you people need to get your input organized.

 Why not ask for a certain topic in an RPG, and stick with it till its a dead h
orse...

LIKE 1. start with a certain section of a game-- like genre...
        would it be universal, my vote is yes.
then go  on to something like statistical representations... use a d100? a d10?
    2d6's?, etc...
then move on to characteristics...

then move on to other topics...  get organized damnit...

just an ol opinion, Smike that's SUPER
