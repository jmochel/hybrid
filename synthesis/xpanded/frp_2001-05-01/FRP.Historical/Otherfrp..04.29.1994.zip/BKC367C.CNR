    Fine, that was what I thought but felt it safer to point ou the
possible problem of leaving it in. That problem is now fixed...

    This sounds good to me too...

             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    Seems a bit redundant to me, but that's okay, I can see where your
coming from... ;->

    If I had to make the choice I would definately lean towards just plain
Strength. If nothing else it will remove all doubt to the nature of the
attribute.

    Fine with me. It was a personal bother anyway...

    Well, some way to measure running speed is important, so I think that
Quickness is a good choice for the attribute.

    Hm... I can see Perception modifying some reaction type situations, but
the kind of Reflex I'm talking about is the doctor tapping your knee. There
is no real Perception component to this direct stimulus. It's more a matter
of how easily you are surprised if I jump out and yell BOO! Perception
would be helpful in something like Dodging an attack, because you might see
it coming before it actually is (sort of reverse telegraphing).

    I think that iff you are trying to limit to the number we currently
have, then definately replace Sanity with Memory. I think that both memory
and leadership need to be represented so don't replace Command, unless you
call it Leadership.
