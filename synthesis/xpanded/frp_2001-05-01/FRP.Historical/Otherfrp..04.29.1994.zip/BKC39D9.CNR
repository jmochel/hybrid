Yeah, but many games nowadays have significant portions of their rules
in "optional" supplements; GURPS seems to have moved away from this to
some extent, as has HERO. TORG, on the other hand, has real problems in
this aspect--it seemed to my group that you could not really play many
of the character types listed in the basic book without buying the
appropriate supplements. _That_ sucks.
