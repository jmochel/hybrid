I think that this pretty much sums up the problems with gaming simulation,
and really any form of reality simulation that you may care to attempt.

I have been pondering these problems in Adventure gaming for about 8 years
now (VERY OFF and some ON).  I think that one approach that has been hinted
at in some of the responses and has been my focus, is SCALABILITY.

A scalable design allows for simple playable rules that can be modularly
made more complex as a situation or desire requires.  The players can
make adjustments to complexity or realism vs. simplistity or playability as
interest demands.  A complex situation could be seen as a "slow mo" scene in a
movie where you really want to catch all the gory (or not so gory detail).

I don't really consider myself much of an expert when it comes to the
various game systems already available - so if this describes your system,
GREAT!  I'd like to hear about what aspects of it's scalability work for you
and which don't.

I think that games when played are made more scalable by the act of playing
them.  GMs or players speed up or slow down the game with their interest
level already.  A good scalable designed game should allow this to happen
very easily and without jarring mind shifts.

One way that I've begun to approach this idea is by tying ATTRIBUTES (of
characters or objects in the world) to the metaphysics of the the game
universe.  This way (in theory) the same set of rules can apply for every
possible entity in that universe - a sort of GRAND UNIFICATION THEORY of
gaming!

Of course in the little amount of time I've had to spend on this project
all that previous has been easier said than done.  But I'd be interested in
responses or ideas along these lines...
