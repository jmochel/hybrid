Subject: DES: Exhaustion

I think your recovery rates for exhaustion are too slow.  Ex- I don't
think it would be unusual to train for 8 hours, (Military, intensive 
schooling, corporate training, fanatic MAers ;-) for extended periods 
of time.
8 hours- 80 ex.  Recovery- 8 hrs sleep 2+4+6(8)=54.  3 meals=9.  63!
Even if you rest a few hours, you still aren't making it!  Am I 
missing something here?  I also thought that ex only built up if you 
used large % of your endurance.  Is that rule going away??
I read somewhere (not sure where) that according to military 
research, long term sleep deprivation is almost totally recovered in 
a single 8 hour sleep.  To me this implies that the rate may be more
logo than you are creditting.  Ideally, I think end/ex should come
back the same as HTK, even though it is more bookkeeping.  Maybe
just a continuos slope?  2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10 + 12 + 14 + 16 = 72
I don't think that is unreasonable.  Otherwise, having high end values
becomes less valuable- you can't use it if you can't recover it!

Hmmm.. I agree in part.   Although long-term sleep deprivation can be 
wiped out by a single night's sleep- what about muscle fatigue and 
strain?  What about mental exhaustion?  

I actually haven't gotten research behind this but my experience is 
that muscle fatigue can last a day or two even under full rest 
conditions.

I don't have a clear idea about mental exhaustion.  I do "feel" that
you prpobably can recover from most menatl exhaution overnight- but
I have worked on menatl projects and been still menatlly tired the next
day (though obviously there could be many factors there.)
Opinions?

BTW: I do agree though that maybe it should be +2 points per hour of 
sleep.

BTW2: Meta-exhaustion models wear and tear above and beyond tiredness.
