Subject: DES: Bt rules discussion


BTW:  In Rev 5 I will resolve the currently ambiguous question of 
which skills belong in which level factor.  

That is not to say there will not be room for Balanced Stricture 
Proposals (BS proposals).  But skills of the same name will go 
under the same level factor.  To have a similar skill from a 
different tact you will need another name.   I will frown on 
this practice so the BS had better be thick and deep....

BT Rules questions:

[1] How do you handle Tactics and Strategy. Are they merely
    information enhancers ?  

Yes and no.  This is a difficult question for all game masters. 

Here is how I handle Stategy:

(a) If I am running a big battle the Strategy will modify the
    success rolls of the Strategists armies. 

(b) When discussing plans successful strategy rolls will actually 
    influence how I run the enemy- if you THINK the enemy will do 
    this and roll a brilliant strategy roll the ENEMY is
    much more likely to do that.

(c) Occasionally I will give hints or clues to the successful 
    strategist- like "No, you think the ambushers would have to
    be idiots to have left that path open" or "you think you would
    put a sniper HERE or THERE."

*

[2] Is QuickDraw:Kata possible and if so how long does it 
    take and what are the mods ?

It is possible- but I owuldn't take it- I would rather take a 
Quickdraw in the first movement of a Kata sinc eyou need to execute
that anyway.

*

[3] QuickDraw:Battle Trance - possible ? Time ? Mods ?  

Again -it is possible.  But the scale is funky.  Every Rank in 
Quickdraw: Battle Trance would subtract [(RANK-2)*2 +2] units 
from the normal one minute Battle Trance time.  Each Unit is
3 seconds.

*

[4] Can someone phase into a Battle Trance or Meditation 
    slowly so that they only get a smaller percentage of the
    bonus or is it a boolean operation ?  

No- that option is not currently available though it should be. 
I suppose a "Light Meditation" generated in half the time would be
fair.  

*

[5] How difficult is it to jump into the midst of a kata ? 
    Time ? Mods ? 

Ummm.. difficult.  I would be tempted to say impossible but of
course- this is BT!  If you weren't going to start at the beginning
I would make you roll the Kata at a -30.  If you were going to
start in the middle of a set I owuld make you roll at a -70 to
your Kata roll(immediatley rollable) an take the -40 florentine mods 
to your action too...  

*

[6] For style's sake: how difficult is an Iajutsu draw aimed at 
    laying the blade against the opponents hilt or hand in 
    order to make it impossible to draw their weapon ?  

It would be the same minuses as a disarm- I believe that is a -45
called shot arm.   

*

[7] What are the mods of using the pommel of the sword as a 
    striking weapon during an Iajutsu draw ?  

A lot.  It is not a standard use of the wepaon though I would give 
you full familiarity because I assume most instructors will teach 
a little pommel work...

I would run it as a -20 medium clubbing weapon at 3/5 your usual 
skill.

*

[8] Is there a Dalkan exercise for training in discernment

Yes- dwell on fortune cookie sayings.  ;-)

You could be trained in Discernment- you think...

*

[9] What skill is required to actively use armor for blocks
    and parrys ?

Armor-wearing

*
 
[10] What is required (Mods and Time ) in order to 
     intentionally "roll with the blow" and quickly shake of the
     effects ? 

You can make an AGL save for half damage in 5 counts.  You can make
a WIL save for half-effects of damage in 5 counts as well.  Both of
these are committed actions- unless done passively and then you get 
half your save.  Critical misses on those saves suck so passive use
is NOT as good an options a sit may seem- unless you have a save of
90 or above.  Passive saves take one count and no re-reaction.

Subject: [long design post]DES: BT Background theory

     Here are some thoughts about BT from Jeff and my replies:
 

ON MODELING DEFENSIVE ACTIONS
    
>     In your recent reply to somebody (evidently a samurai) you told them
>that you could roll vs. your AGL save as a 5 count action to "roll with
>the blow."  How does this differ from defense, which was described to me
>as including "rolling with the blow."  Also, I believe that is the description
>you used for PAB, explaining why you have to see the attack coming.  Are
>defense, AGL saves, PAB, and even active defense cumulative?!?

In a reductionist mechanism we would want a single number called DEFENSE or 
something like that and it would cover your mean defense potential.  This 
isn't that.   There are multiple mechanisms to cover that which we call 
defense and FOR THE MOST PART they are cumulative.  Defense[DEF], AGL saves
[rolling with the blow], and Physical Absorption[PAB] are completley cumulative.  Active defesne is cumulative in the sense that it has a defined impact on your 
DEF.  Rolling woith the blow is a full blown active action.  Doing anything 
while rolling with the blow would require a florentine.  

As people come up with things they do in real life I may invent new mechanisms
to handle it.  Active defense is the active application of DEF.  You might say 
that "Rolling with the Blow" is an active application of PAB.

They are very closely linked.  In real life we are reacting simulataneously and 
constantly to our perceptual input and our memeory based on training and 
instinct.  It is an artificial model to try and seperate things out into specific
skills that are applied seperately and produce seperate results.  In Real Life(TM) 
defesne is a synergistic combination of all of our training, background and experience occuring simultaneously as something we later call defending our 
selves.  The mechanism of BT is a poor and one-dimensional representation of 
that.  I have chosen more than one mechanism because I am trying to achieve a
sense of being able to duplicate all that people lionk to defense and combat.
    
ON THE MECHANISM FOR MODELING KATA

>I have seen people jump into the middle of katas.  I think it is difficult
>if someone is in a class for them to start at a move which somebody else

I don't believe in muscle memory by the way- there have been recent studies
which actually point to there being no such thing...  HOWEVER this is nitpicking
since what I believe you are referring to is that level of skill at which actions
automatically occur without too much or no apparent conscious thought of the user.

WHat is a kata - a skill that allows you to perform a series of pre-defined 
specific actions as pre-sets and with speed bonuses based on your rank in kata.

That being said, I also want to distinguish what "jumping in the middle of
katas"  means:  It means jumping to any variable move inside the stream of 
moves a Kata is.  Note that a Kata, as defined in BT, is formed of sets of 
moves. You can have from two to 10 sets inside a Kata.  For instance, a set 
would be: 
Front punch-upper level, Feint-upper level(hand), Kick-lower level.

There is NO penalty for starting a set even if it is the third set into the 
Kata.  There is only a penalty for starting INSIDE a set.  AND if you do not go 
into the set that is supposed to follow that set you need to roll a full 
initiative to go into the out-of-order set.  

I have two "justifications" for this rule:

First, the answer lies in my personal experience.  If I doa Keiakazuki-mid 
level, I do not automatically step into the 7th move of Heian Shodan (turn
left and upper block).  However, if I do a Look right, Block right-low, 
Keiakazuki-midlevel, I DO automatically go to a turn left and block-upper level.
I would propose that people you have seen jump right into a kata jump into the 
start of a set.

Two, it is a game mechanic that controls the kata from becoming too generic 
and unkata-like ( someone always takes the moves from the kata : stike-midlevel, strike mid-level or strike-upper level, strike upper level.  Having at least 
three moves in a set makes the predictability and power of knowing someone's 
style much more interesting to play.

'Nuff said?


ON HORSEMANSHIP   
 
>Horsemanship should be VHF.  Horsemanship should be VHF.  Horsemanship
>should be VHF.  Horsemanship should be VHF.  What level factor would you

A motorcycle AGF?  Good question- maybe it should be....:-);-)

I am unsure on this count...  one difference is that you need to convince a
horse where to go, not steer it like a car.  At its most difficult moments
horsemanship is a combination of hanging on (balance and agility factor), 
and directing the horse with your weight distribution (balance and 
coordination).  This true to a lesser degree for motorcycles and I agree that
motorcycles very well might be AGF.  

But, I am not attached to that... I need to hear other people's opinions as
well- anyone on horsemanship...?

ON SKILL FACTOR

>put it elsewhere for you.

What you say is true- it is an alternative to dismantle SKF and distribute it's contents to the other level factors.  However, though it is possible I am not 
sure it is good for the game.  Here is why:

The system is not a perfect model and one of the things that the level factors 
do is categorize skills sets that influence one another.  I like the paradigm
that people who track and hunt are better at putting horseshoes on or smithing.
I like it that smiths are also better craftsman.  It is more of a feel thing 
than anything else.

I would be open to suggestions, and open to changing SKF if people think it 
doesn't serve the game..

Opinions...?

ON GENERAL AND SPECIFIC SKILLS

>     In Rev. 5.0, maybe you could detail how a specific skill and a more
>general skill (but not a "General" skill) compare.  For example, who would
>have the best chance of finding a tricky network link, a guy with a 7.0 in

>Unix Networks (assuming they are working in Unix, of course)?  Or say I
>have a 3.0 in Radio Repair, but Borealis has a 6.0 in Electrical Eng.  Who

>general a skill as you want.  Obviously, more specific skills should be
>more powerful in their area of focus, but what are the guidelines?

Interesting- I will do that.  Right now skills need to be either a Primary
(10% per rank), A General(3% per rank), or Support skills(3% per rank).   
Network Ops. would be the primary skill.  UNIX system lore would be the support 
skill.  By the way you can have a support skill as a primary skill - I.e. if 
your UNIX system lore was better than your  network ops you could use your UNIX system lore as a primary if your were doing network ops using the UNIX system.

I haven't found this unbalancing yet so...  I am open to this discussion 
though...


Well that is already too much for now- I wasted way too much time doing this.
Please respond- I will see you all later...
