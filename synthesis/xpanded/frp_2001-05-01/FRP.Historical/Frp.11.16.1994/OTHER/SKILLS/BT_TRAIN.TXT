>P.S. training rule checklist.  Please double check.

Good Idea!

>You get 1 EP every 10 hours of self study, at a cost of 50 Ext. (Exaustion)

Ummm.. no 10 hours of study costs 100 Ext!  

>You get 1 EP every 8 hours of group study, at a cost of 40 Ext.

Likewise- 80 ext!  Maybe this is why you thought traiing was too easy!

>You get 1 EP every (5 hours - 15 min * (teachers teaching level +

>
>The Ext cost of learning by being taught is 10 Ext per hour.

There is a minimum- the combined teacher's rank differential in the skill with
the student and teaching skill cannot exceed 8.   Therefore the fastest anyone 
can learn is 3 hours per ep!  Now mind you the teacher still adds 1% per rank 
to the ep roll so.... 

Remember also Meta-Exhaustion!  Both Physical and Mental Exhayuustion feed into it
and it accumulates at 1 Meta-Exhaustion per 10 Exhaustion used.  (That may be 
too harsh- I am not sure! I am playing with going to 20 Exhaustion used equals a 
Meta-Exhaustion.



ALso-> Training rules:  Typically one cannot train more than (INT + DRV)/4 in a day.
	EXHAUSTION(includes mental and physical sim.) COMES BACK:  
		2 per hour of rest
		Sleep-> 2 first hour, 4 second hour, 8 every hour thereafter
		Meals-> A meal will restore 3 ext. (Maximum three meals per day- at
			least one hour apart.)
	META-EXHAUSTION comes back: 
		1 per NIGHT of sleep
		1 every 4 hours if a total day is spent in rest, if most of the day 
			is restful, and no HEAVY labor is one 1 per 8 hours is
			recovered  (one cannot use more than a quarter of one's 
			exhaustion on a day such as this.)

	Using these rules I calculated a driven, intelligent student with the best 
teachers and time to burn could earn around 600 eeps in a year.  That is optimal!
It assumes the student has a 16 INT and a 16 DRV.  

That is the equivelant 0f about 14-15 runs.  I am not sure that's a bad thing!  


BTW:  I odn't havce my notes with me so if any of these number s are worng let me
know- I don't think they are.  BUt my formula for maximum hours of trianing a day, 
or maybe speed of recovery of exhaustion is a little off- but it will only be a marginal difference.  These are at LEAST ball park correct numbers, and probably 
completely correct.

Hopefully we will get to start playing more next year! (Jazz and Dangerous- your building up lack of running momentum!)

	If you train more than 7 hours per day you lose 7 Meta
exhaustion and will need to rest at least 1 day.  So, you can't train
more than half the days in a year effectively, so with 16 Int and Drv,
you will be able to train less than 4 hours per day on average.  That
gives 486.67 EP's per year.

Teaching in BT:

WARNING: I discuss intensity level here.   Intensity has always been ther ebut we ignored it because we didn't have Real Solid Rules(TM).  In the next rev
these, I think will be the rules.


Hmmm...

I have been placing a cap on the amount: 
Teaching skill + (Teacher's Rank - Student's Rank -1) 

That cap has been twelve.  12*15m=3h.  This means two hours is the
fastest someone can teach you.  

Standard training is intensity level five. 

The intensity of the training can also up to double the speed- so if you
are training at intensity level ten (i.e. they throw you in a pit and 
start pouring lava in and then say okay- control fire NOW!) with a 
teacher that is more then six ranks higher than you in control fire and 
is a six rank teacher you will get a roll in 45 minutes.  

In reality it might be faster at that level but them is the breaks!



So base time is ten hours.  

Having teacher (a person at least one rank higher than you in skill, who is
dedicating half their energy to training you for the traiing time period)
cuts the time to five hours.

Having partner(s) (person who is plus or minus two skill levels of you 
and training with you in the same skill) cuts the base time to 8 hours.

Teacher's RANK in skill minus Student's RANK in Skill -1 = # of -15 minutes
	*MAX: 5
Teacher's RANK in Teaching = # of - 15 minutes
	*Teaching skill is divided into Physical, Mental, and Internal
INtensity Level of Training - 5 = # of - 15 minute intervals.
	*Scale is 1(think about it) to 10 (real combat).  EXT costs per 
	 training hour equal 2*INTENSITY.  
	MISHAP chance = 5%*(INTENSITY-5). It is always 1%.
