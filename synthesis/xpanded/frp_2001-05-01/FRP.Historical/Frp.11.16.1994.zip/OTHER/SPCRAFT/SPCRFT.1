Hmm.  About two years ago I put together a space craft construction
system for a campaign I was running, also based off the Space Master
system, with a lot of ideas taken from the GURPS Space system mentioned
in one of the other posts here.  Essentially, the goal (which I think
I succeeded at fairly well) was to put together a more detailed system
of my own design that still used the Space Master stuff for combat
and was compatible with Space Master characters.  I'm afraid that
the number crunching remains horrendus, though (actually, it got
worse...), although that didn't really bother me too much.
Nonetheless, I'd be happy to compare notes, if you're interested.

(Note:  I am currently working under contract to a software company
to develop a space combat system for an upcoming computer game.
As it IS a computer game, the relation to the game I'm describing
here is vague at best--one might even say virtually nonexistant.
Certainly, I have no intention of taking any ideas you give me
and using them in my own game.  Nonetheless, if this sort of
thing bothers you, I recommend not giving me the details of
the system you've come up with.)

Well, since the universe we're playing in is a higher tech level than
SM, the first thing I did was to use the tonnage in place of the 
volume in most of the calculations. This reduced all the components
to approx. 1/3 size. Then I created new ratios for the extra components.
The hardest part was the weapons, they work on a different scale.

    There are two extreems in Spaceship consturtion, neither one i've found all
    that attractive.  One is the Megatraveller method, where you figure in the
    mass and volume of the componants, and do all sorts of tricky figuring to 
    get them to turn out right.  It is horrendously long to make anything this
    way, and it can be very tricky to make a ship to fit your requirements.
    
    The other way is to simply work from the mass of the major components,
    ignoring the volume.  Either theirs a maximum mass for the hull size, or
    for a given mass the drives must be larger.  many games (Start Trek or 
    Early Traveller simply have standard hull sizes that all the components
    must be fitted into, and standard drive sizes, and the performance is 
    calculated off a table.
    
    Part of the problem I see you having is that you've got a huge amount of 
    variation.  Ship size alone varies by a factor of 200,000!  add the 
    differing types of drives, weapons and sheilds, and your talking about
    either a truly massive ship building system, or one with very little 
    detail.
    
    Some games to research are:  Megatraveller, High Guard, and Traveller 2300
    for detailed spreadsheet type systems, and Star Trek the RPG (NOT Star
    Fleet Battles) old style Traveller and Aerotech for simple style systems.

    Good luck, your going to need it.
