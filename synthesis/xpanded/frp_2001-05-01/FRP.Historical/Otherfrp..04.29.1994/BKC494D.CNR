     But you can also learn (sometimes a LOT) from your mistakes!!  Failure
or success shouldn't garentee increases or decreases in knowledge.  Usually
it should increase skill, because even if it isn't perfect, you've learned
a way to accomplish the task (or a way not to).

[Regarding Dieties]

     Dieties by definition should have no stats.  If you accept the concept
of a diety, s/he should have 100% control over his sphere/element.  By the
same token dieties shouldn't appear (but their followers/supernatural agents/
etc can and those should be defined).

     I absolutely hate the "Let's raid Hell today!!" game concept!  A true
diety should be such a master of his home that he could remove anyone there
from existance with a single thought.

>Why stamp "Rogue" on a PC?  Why limit what a PC can learn anyway?

     The reason for classes is that when you are trained to be say, a
compter scientist, you learn a certain method of thinking.  Things that fall
in line with that methodology are easier to learn than things that don't.

     I don't think it's wise to limit what a PC can learn, but it is
necessary (to be realistic anyway) to make some things HARD to learn based on
the PC's fundemental training.  There are two ways to do this (that I can
think of):

     1) For every skill mark the related skills (as well as pre-reqs of
          course) and the skills that are "in opposition".  The opposition
          skills must be more expensive and the related ones cheaper.  Skills
          that aren't listed as either are not affected.

          My initial reaction to this is YUCK!!!  If you have more than about
          5 skills people will give up on the disgusting links created.

     2) Declare the character to be of a particular class/profession/career
          and set the costs of skills on the basis of career.  The choice of
          career indicates initial training:  a computer specialist is
          assumed to have taken basic math, so advanced math comes easier to
          him than if his initial training were in art.

>Another thing I have a problem with is the idea of the Universal RPG.  I
>*hate* the idea of GURPS!...  I think the system that covers all genres
>adequately covers none of them well.

     I have to agree (but not as vehemently) that it's difficult to make a
good Generic RPG.  Generics tend to be not real good at any one genre because
too many concessions have to be made to make it work for all.

[dice system]
>     - Use a difficulty system
>     - Keep the numbers small
>     - Keep arithmetic to naught
>     - Stick with one or two types of dice

     I also like difficulty systems.

     I recommend however, percentile.  Though it covers a bigger range, it's
much easier to deal with.  EVERYONE has an intuitive feel for percentages.
If the GM decides there's a 17% chance to accomplish something, which is
easier for him to figure out:  what to roll on 1d6, 3d6, d20, or d100?  Plus
the advantage of a good range of numbers that gives the GM freedom to give
slight advantages to specific rolls.  (ie:  that idea's a little better than
average; I'll give you a +4%)  And all you need is d10's.

     I personally see no advantage to calling Stength Muscle.  Other than an
irrational hatred for words begining with 'S', what specifically do you have
against Strength?  I agree (as my earlier post shows) that Dex is not a fine
enough graduation for what should be fine-motor control (call it manual
dexterity or eye-hand-coordination) and gross-motor control (call it agility
or co-ordination).  And I think con may suffer from the same sizing-problem,
but I still don't see a problem with Strength.

     And I'm not about to exclude words that have been used by other game
systems!  We'll never get anywhere that way (Roll to hit, dice, skill,
intellegence, power, etc)

     I actually like our current list of stats, but here's some comments on
your list:

>Coordination -- grace and hand-eye coordination

     Very different things.  See my earlier post.

>Speed -- reflex and quickness of muscle

     How is this different from Co-ordination's Grace aspect when doing large
movements or the eye-hand coordination for fine, detailed movements?

>Reason -- logical and mathematical ability
>Creativity -- ability to come up with new ideas or combine things in new ways

     Where's memory?  As in recolection of aquired fact.  I'd also rather put
Reason and Creativity together as Reasoning:  the generation of concepts and
inferences.  Sort of the application of facts.  Unless you're thinking of a
specific game mechanism to go with Creativity.  Maybe magic requires
creativity where as science and engineering require reasoning?  Otherwize I'm
missing the point.

>Instinct -- a perceptual "sixth sense" based on minute details picked up
>          by the subconscious

     I'd rather keep to the general category of Perception than specify a
sense here.

>Personality -- charm, "likeability"

     Why not call it Charm?  Or (dare I use a D&D term??) Charisma?
Personality is the sum total of your mental/emotional/spiritual being.  Or to
use the dictionary's definition:  "the pattern of collective character,
behavioral, tempermental, emotional, and mental traits of an individual"
