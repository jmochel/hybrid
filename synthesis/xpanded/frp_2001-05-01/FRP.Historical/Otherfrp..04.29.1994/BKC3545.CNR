I tend to agree with David.  If we generate a spirit of cooperation and not
worry about game "OWNERSHIP", we'll create something really neat TOGETHER.
The great part is, that when you take the game home to play, you can change
any of those parts you really felt strongly about!

The creative energies of a group design will be dampened if we get bogged
down in logistical decision making.

Design schedule:

I would like it if we worked on the game from the abstract to the specific.
It was mentioned earlier that "Jason, go make a world, without Barns...".
might be a way to build this thing.  I personally am much more interested
in the abstract portions of the game (at least initially).

For me thats why Adam's document was so great.  It stated a very abstract
set of criteria about what a great game should accomplish.  Most of us
seemed to agree with it, began to hammer at the words, identify problems
and generate progress.  It seemed that an early problem that needs work
was the unification problem and the problem of point system scaling.

If we are able to come up with a few ideas about how to approach point system
scaling, we can then use this as an abstract tool to attack other problems
and form the nucleus of the game.  Scaling is one of the "INFRASTRUCTURE"
items of a game system.  The other items are well identified by Adam. Once we
work on how this infrastructure might look in the generic, we can see how the
various pieces might fit together.

Anyone can contribute at anytime, and some may submit more specific proposals
and they might work out well, or they might be moving to fast for most.  But
we should all help each other.  The way I see it is we have a thread going
that can interest us for quite a while, lets just get on with it in free
form and see where it takes us.  The only hang up right away is, do we need
another listserver to do it?  Others on the List, do you want us to move?
If so, does someone volunteer to set up the new listserver?
