    This is a good idea, a should make it easier for those who don't want
to participate ignore or delete the posts easier...

    I really like these categories, about the only one I can think to add
right now would be:

  Quickness	Reflexes	Instinct

    This is a really good starting point for the system, and I think this
version of handling attributes is something a little different, and that's
a good thing.

    Making this a PD project will make most things easier in the long run.
Otherwise we would be tied up in legal nonsense forever and never get
anything constructive done on the system.

    Yeah, I could see paying money for something like this if the person
that pieced it together made it all coherent.

    I personally have never seen either...

    This definately gets points for simplicity of use, I think that it's a
very workable system just from the looks of it (never having played
Cyberpunk, but Ars Magica has something very similar)

    Well since this kind of thing is the norm for packaging a gaming
system, this is a safe assumption to make. That is if the person doing such
plans to make some kind of profit from it.

    I don't know the law, and also don't have ready access to it, but this
is something that will need to be talked about. Hopefully there is a simple
(yeah, right!) resolution to this possible problem.
