        The following is my contribution to what stats could be used
in the RPG.  My feeling is why use some neat mystical name for a
stat? Just call it what it is.


Attribute descriptions:
Physical Strength (PS) is a measure of a character's muscle co-
ordination and strength.

Manual Dexterity (MD) is a measure of a character's digital
control.  This represents the characters hand-to-eye
coordination, the speed at which he may perform a complex task
with his hands.

Agility (AG) is a measure of a character's ability to maneuver
his body and the speed at which he moves.

Endurance (EN) is a measure of the punishment a character's body
can absorb before he becomes unconscious, sustains mortal wounds,
or dies.  It is also used to determine if a person will be able
to be Raised after being killed.

Magic Aptitude (MA) is a measure of a character's ability to
harness and direct magical energies.  A character must have an MA
of at least 5 to perform magic and if MA is 0 can never learn it.
MA is also used to determine if a character may use items that
have charges and items that must become attuned to a person (i.e.
a person with an MA of 5 will probably only be able to use items
that have continuous functions, i.e. a +5 sword).

Willpower (WP) is a measure of a character's control of his mind
and body, especially in stressful situations.

Intelligence (IN) is a measure of a character's reasoning
ability.  Also how well a person is able to learn things.  I.e. a
new skill or even increasing proficiency with an old one.

Fatigue (FT) is a measure of the length of time that a character
can sustain activities requiring a great deal of physical or
mental exertion.

Knowledge (KN) is a measure of a person's worldly knowledge and
his chance to know something he may have heard previously.

Manipulation (MN) is a measure of a character's ability to
convince other people to do something that they want them to do.

Perception (PC) is a measure of a character's intuition developed
as a result of his experience.

Physical Beauty (PB) is a measure of a character's exterior
attractiveness (or repulsiveness), as perceived by a member of a
humanoid race.
