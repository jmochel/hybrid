I would like to hear some suggestions how to roll dice (preferably  
six-siders) so that the distribution of the result has the following  
traits:

1.  Open-ended high and low
  i.e. will give a result from -inf to +inf.

2.  Symmetrical.

3.  Zero mean (well I guess this follows from 2....)

4. (Optional)  The chance of rolling n+3 is about equal to one half the  
chance of rolling n, for n positive.
   Similarly for n negative.

5.  Preferably >no chart<.

I already have a few ideas for this...

Well, it's a bit difficult given the above information, but how about
something like this:

A person starts with one success automatically. Then they gain or lose
successes on each roll of a 1 or a 6. Thus if I roll a six sided and
don't get a 1 or a 6, then I stop rolling. But each time I get a 1
or a 6 I add or subtract 1, then roll again. Thus the following:

Rolls:					Successes:
4					1
1 5					0
1 1 4					-1
1 6 3					1
1 6 1					0 
6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 1 5			9
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2			-8

Well, it's just a thought anyway.

I have a solution that fulfills all of your requirements, but you
probably had one other unstated requirement that my solution doesn't
fulfill.

System: Keep flipping a coin as long as you get tails, and keep count.
As soon as you get heads, stop (if you get heads on your first flip,
your count is 0).  Multiply your count by three.  Then, roll a die.

If you roll 1, your score is -(count+2).
If you roll 2, your score is -(count+1).
If you roll 3, your score is -count.

If you roll 4, your score is count.
If you roll 5, your score is count+1.
If you roll 6, your score is count+2.

A moment's thought will show that this is symetrical about 0, is
open-ended, and p(n+3) is exactly p(n)/2 for n > 0.  The drawback is
that the distribution is not very smooth, and that fully 1/6 of the
scores will be 0.

This is an interesting method...  However, even though I did not make it  
explicit, what I meant in stipulation 3. is that the chance of rolling at  
least n+k is about equal to (1/2)^(k/3) times the chance of rolling at  
least n, for n, k positive.  

To all: I received several suggestions, and I will post a summary in the  
near future.  Thank you all for your help.

Take 2N dice, half of them counting for positive and the other half
for negative. For any x's rolled (where x is a selected constant, see
below) roll another die of the same type, repeating this until the
total number of dice rolled is 2N+number of x's. Then subtract the
negative from the positive.

You can vary this by changing N, x or the kind of dice rolled.

A variation uses coins: You throw coins until you have N heads. Count
the total number of throws. Repeat and subtract new number.

Below is shown a few examples. I have rolled 300000 times for each
example
