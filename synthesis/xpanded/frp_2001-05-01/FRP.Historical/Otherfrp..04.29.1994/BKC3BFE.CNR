Agreed.  I have thought about this in a reversal twist.  For me, attributes
ARE skills.  They are generic abstract references to skill categories.
In previous posts of mine, the way I was trying to treat attributes was
in this way.  I don't think I described myself very well (nobody seemed
to grasp what I was saying - or liked it)

Anyway, for me a set of good ABSTACT ATTRIBUTES ARE ALL YOU SHOULD NEED TO
PLAY A SIMPLE GAME.  You can hang more complex sets of (more specific) skills
off the abstact attributes as the GM requires (this is scalability!).
And as a group the net can specify good ways of doing this...(and everyone
is).

ATTRIBUTE NAMES:

For me the names don't matter at all.  I want a game system that can
handle any version or set of attributes a GM would like to use.  The system
would suggest a set or sets to use, but can accomodate the addition or
subtraction of attributes.  THIS IS WHAT A UNIVERSAL GAME SYSTEM *COULD*
ACCOMPLISH.  (might be too hard for this group to do though).

If we come up with a set of attributes (like above - and I've been guilty of
it too) and then begin to hang rules etc. off those names etc. we have
only locked our game up a bit (IMHO).  Changing rules or aspects becomes
that much more harder, and we have failed (at least partially) in creating
modularity.

Don't  get me wrong, as a specific list of attributes those are great.

GENRE:

I agree with Ursus, that it isn't necessary to specify a genre. (of course
comming from me who wants to talk about nameless attributes this isn't
surprising).  Adam said it best: "any well-designed game should be very
adaptable to any genre" So why worry about it?

GENRE & MODULARITY:

When Ursus says:

> among many genres, if not all)?  I think it's possible to have one system that

She (?) is RIGHT ON!  Way to go!

EXPERIENCE POINTS:

I don't like XP.  Just another stat. Like skills (and for me attributes)
they should automatically represent experience.

SCALING ATTRIBUTES/SKILLS:

Maybe this is a dead horse, but for me to accomplish what I've tried outlining
above about attributes, allowing game objects to have collapsable/expandable
attributes allows for great flexibility for the GM and us designers, because
any of us can then plug in our own list of attributes/skills as we deem fit.
THIS IS MODULARITY AND ADAPTABILITY!!!

YES! Our system should be able to accomplish this (if the GM wants).

Sorry.  Exactly what my point was.  In fact I don't want to talk about dice
systems for quite awhile, till the abstract frameworks are figured out.
Just as Attributes/Skills can change so can dice systems.

Deciding dice systems should be virtually last in my opinion, or really any
dice systems can be plugged in A WELL DESIGNED UNIVERSAL GAME as needed.

MIND/BODY POST COMMENT (For those that care..)

I was not really trying to push a specific system (God forbid I put numbers
down - they were meant only to help crystalize an image).  I was really using
the system I had worked on only to hightlight some of the abstract concepts
that are near and dear to my heart.

This net group can create a GREAT game.  It can create a GREAT game that
has a set of agreed upon skills and systems, and it will be GREAT.  BUT,
we could also create a great UNIVERSAL MODULAR GAME that could handle
anyone's attribute/skill wishes if we really worked on it.  Maybe I'm
pushing a pipe dream, and maybe this is too hard a goal for this group,
or maybe I can't make myself clear, but if anyone sees a glimmer of this
idea in their mind and thinks they understand me (and have a vision to share)
we can work in the stratosphere to provide a modular framework that the
other's skill system will cradle on/under (no matter what they figure out).

Am I dreaming...  Or isn't this what sort of sparked the game design thread
in the first place and underlined every word in Adam's criteria list....
