5.87  Hit Location in Combat
============================
 
By: Christian Otkjaer

This rule requires more bookkeeping on the part of each player and the
GM, and complicates combat.  However, it should add more excitement to
combat as well.  Characters can be kept alive a bit longer, but at the
cost of leaving them severely in need of medical aid. 
 
5.871  Hit Location
-------------------
 
As suggested briefly in Section 3.6, players can aim at a specific body
part during battle.  There is a penalty for the size of the part, as
follows:
 
	Eyes, coins, etc.: -3
	Hands, feet, heads, pixies, etc.: -2
	Legs, arms, leprechauns, etc.: -1
	Human torsos, halflings, giants' legs, etc.: +0
	Giant's body (if you can reach it), dragons, cars, etc.: +1 or
	   more  (Subtract 1 from final damage so this +1 to hit does
	   not become a +1 to damage, also.)
 
If the player doesn't specify a body part, it is assumed to be a torso
attack.
 
These are for melee combat.  For a ranged attack, simply set the degree
task appropriately higher.
 
If the range is too distant, you can't aim at a specific part.  Instead,
roll to hit the torso as usual.  If successful, use a random hit location
by rolling 1d6:
 
Rolled	Hit
 1	Extremity
 2	Leg
 3	Torso
 4	Torso
 5	Arm
 6	Head
 
On a result of Extremity, roll another d6: 1-3 = Foot; 4-6 = Hand.
On a result of Hand, Foot, Arm or Leg, roll another d6: 1-3 = left; 
   4-6 = right.
 
A game company called The Armory makes a "Hit Location" die with a
different circled body part on each face.  You could simply use one of
these, instead.
 
[Digression: both The Armory and Flying Buffalo, Inc., make some
interesting novelty dice that would work very well with FUDGE, and are
recommended.  You can get dice showing pictures of different fumbles,
critical hits, NPC reactions, noises, monster encounters, treasure,
weather, corridor options, traps, doors, etc.  Ask your local retailer 
to check his distributor's catalog under "Dice."  - S.O'S.]
 
Aiming at a specific body part means a -1 to Initiative if using those
rules.
 
5.872  Damage to an Individual Body Part
----------------------------------------
 
Each body part has its own Damage Capacity, all based on the the
character's general Damage Capacity:
 
Foot:  -2 levels to general Damage Capacity
Hand:  -2 levels
Arm:   -1 level
Leg:   -1 level
Head:  -1 level
Torso: -0 level
 
That is, someone of overall Fair Damage Capacity has Poor Damage Capacity
in each foot and hand,  Mediocre Damage Capacity in his head and in each
arm and leg, and Fair Damage Capacity in the torso.  His *Constitution*
is not affected by this, though: if he has Fair Constitution, all body
parts have Fair Constitution.
 
You could represent this on the back of the character sheet as a table.
For example, here is a table for someone of Fair Damage Capacity:
 
		Scratch    Hurt    Very hurt  Incapacitated  Near Death
Torso:             2         2          2          2           2
Head:              2         2          1          2           2
 
Body and head wounds are treated exactly as in the main text.
 
The terms "Incapacitated" and "Near Death" are replaced by the terms
"Useless" and "Crippled" for the limbs.
 
		Scratch    Hurt    Very hurt    Useless    Crippled
Left arm:          2         2          1          2           2
Left hand:	   2         1          1          2           2
Right arm:         2         2          1          2           2
Right hand:        2         1          1          2           2
Left leg:          2         2          1          2           2
Left foot:         2         1          1          2           2
Right leg:         2         2          1          2           2
Right foot:        2         1          1          2           2
 
5.873  Useless and Crippled Limbs
---------------------------------
 
A character drops whatever he was holding in a hand or arm that becomes
useless.  It must be healed before it can be used again.
 
If a leg or foot becomes useless, the character falls down.  (A Superb
agility roll might prevent this, if the GM is willing.)  He can stand and
move again (slowly) if he leans on something, even if it's just a
makeshift cane.
 
A crippled limb is the same as useless, but takes twice as long to heal.
 
Any limb that takes damage beyond crippled is permanently cut off,
crisped, withered, mangled, etc., depending on the attack.  Only magic,
cyberware or a miracle will help in these cases.
 
5.874  Modifiers Due to Damage
------------------------------
 
Only the most severe Wound counts for negative modifier purposes, and
only for an appropriate activity.
 
Example: a character is Hurt (-1) in his right arm, Very Hurt (-2) in his
left leg, and Hurt (-1) in his right foot.  He is at -2 to all actions
involving the left leg, which include fighting while standing.  The -1 to
his right foot is not cumulative with this damage.  However, he is only
at -1 if trying to pick a lock, since only the arm wound counts in this
action.
 
5.875  Keeping Track of Wounds
------------------------------
 
You can still use the card method to track wounds, but you should make
your own cards indicating what they are for.  E.g., a card with a picture
of a left hand or "left hand" written on it counts as a wound to
(surprise!) the left hand.  You might just want to record wounds on paper
instead.
 
5.876  Widespread Damage
------------------------
 
If a character is hit by a giant fireball, a flame thrower, the blast
from a grenade, a cave in, etc., the damage must be distributed to each
afflicted part.
 
Figure the final damage as usual.  Every part of the body that possibly
could be affected takes *half* (round up) of the final damage.  If you
have different armor on different parts of your body the calculation must
be made for each body part.  (A Space Crusader in heavy battle armor
might not mind a blast from a flame thrower, unless he had just taken off
his gloves . . . or helmet!)
