As long as you're categorizing character abilities in a sort of chart,
you might want to look at a chart I made up a while ago and adapted to
the discussion. There are four groups of abilities, and four classes
of ability for each group.

Like this...

            Physical   Mental      Social      Spiritual*
Power       Strength   Ego         Charm       ?
Accuracy    Dexterity  Perception  Empathy     ?
Quickness   Agility    Reaction    Contacts    ?
Toughness   Endurance  Will        Reputation  ?

* I can't think of good individual names for the spiritual stats. Note
that the Spiritual ability group could also be called Astral, Magical,
or Psionic, depending on the genre of the game you're playing.

Each ability group would govern skill use in one area of the game. The
Physical group would govern physical skills and combat, the Mental
group would govern mental skills and contests, the Social group would
govern social skills and contests, and the Spiritual group would
govern magical, psionic, and religious skills and contests. The
various classes of ability would be used to judge skill use, with the
Power class determining damage or effect, Accuracy determining
probability of success, Quickness determining whether you are on the
offensive or defensive, and Toughness determining how vulnerable you
are. The resulting array is extremely modular, scalable, and makes it
very easy to write broadly usable game systems.

One way to determine character abilities would be to have each
character generate 8 ability scores, 4 for the groups and 4 for the
classes, and add or multiply them for the inner scores, as it seems
that they should be correlated.

For instance, I might have a character rolled on D10 with Power 1,
Accuracy 10, Quickness 9, Toughness 3, Physical 7, Mental 1, Social 1,
and Spiritual 5. His resulting ability array or matrix would look
like this (left is added, right is multiplied):

            Physical 7 Mental 1    Social 1    Spiritual 5
Power 1     8  / 7     2  / 1      2  / 1      6  / 5
Accuracy 10 17 / 70    11 / 10     11 / 10     15 / 50
Quickness 9 16 / 63    10 / 9      10 / 9      14 / 45
Toughness 3 10 / 21    4  / 3      4  / 3      8  / 15

Another possibility would be to roll once for each group and class,
and once for each cell in the matrix, and then total each cell up with
the corresponding group and class. This would match the 3Dx method of
character generation.
