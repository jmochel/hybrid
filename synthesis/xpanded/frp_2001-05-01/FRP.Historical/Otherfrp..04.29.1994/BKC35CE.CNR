This is long...

.This is a look at my proposed difficulty system.  I first saw this system in
.Adventure Quest/Jaern, a fantasy RPG published by Lafayette Simulations, a
.small game company out of Valparaiso, Indiana.  The game was released at
 GenCon
.'91 this last August by the designers, Daniel Lawrence and Robert Blake.

[roll dice vs. skill, number of dice = difficulty of task]

The same system has been used in a number of games before.  While it
is appealing in its simplicity, it breaks down when used for
detailed RPG's.  It works well for Ghostbusters-type games, where
detail isn't a goal.  The problem is that there is no way to make a
task a bit harder than a two-die task but easier than a three-die
task (for example).  If the RPG should be able to give people a
bonus for aiming for 3 seconds, as well as for bracing himself, and
for buying the special model bow with counterweights, there are a
series of small modifiers which are lost if you only have a choice
of rolling two or three dice.
