You can thank Daniel Lawrence personally by buying his game, Adventure Quest.
AQ is original and fresh in a lot of places.  I might be able to dig up an
address if anyone is interested.  The game sells for less than $20.

Gamers are reknowned for their ability to adjust to new systems.  I was at the
AQ demos at GenCon, and no one had any trouble understanding the new dice
system.

Your solution doesn't work.  It'd be harder to go from a 30-31 on 6d6 than from
a 31-32...

We could use a flat % chance of increasing the ability.  That doesn't allow for
open-ended rolls, but no PC should EVER have skills anywhere NEAR 100 anyway...

For all practical purposes, short of leaving it completely open-ended for
application in a super-heroes game, this works.

I wrote the program to generate the percentages at home, and ported the results
to the DEC machine.  When I wrote the accompanying text, I realized that all my
results were 1 row off (due to a computational mistake), so I fixed them.  Not
well enough, I guess...


NEW MATERIAL CONCERNING THE APPLICATION OF THIS SYSTEM---

For opposing rolls (such as combat) we could let a player CHOOSE how many dice
he would roll for an attack.  If he fails, his turn is over; he fails.

If he succeeds, the opposing character must make a skill/attribute check using
the SAME NUMBER OF DICE.  If he succeeds, then the attacker fails.


Example: Arm Wrestling

On Player X's turn, X decides to roll 4 dice.  He rolls 3d6 and successfully
rolls under his Strength attribute, which is very high.

Player Y has a low Strength, but has a moderate Arm Wrestling skill, which is
added to Strength for this match.

Y must roll less than that total on 4 dice to fend off X's arm-overbearing
attempt.

On Y's turn, Y chooses how many dice will be rolled...
