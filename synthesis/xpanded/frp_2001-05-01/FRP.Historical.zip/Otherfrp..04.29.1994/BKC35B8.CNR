In the system I am/was designing I intended to do this by assigning a
percentage score (by a formula or table) to exceptionally high skill
levels, and this had to be taken away from all exprience earned (if the
skill was to be maintained at that level, else it would fall slowly back to
the point where 0% was required to maintain the skill), btw: the system
was/is purely skill based, so skills are advanced whenever xp is earned
(ie: no level concept) though this would be logical to do at certain
times to avoid slowing down gameplay.  This method of skill advancement
also meant training in new skills was not a problem, the DM just assigns
n xp for spending a great deal of time practising or getting trained in
a skill.

I personally don't see this as the function of an instinct attribute (if
one were to be included), I would regard it more as perception, do you
feel someone watching you from the bushes ahead, if you take an
instictively defensive postion when you see the flash of a blade in the
dark etc.

I like these as the attributes, I was going to reply to the original
poster, and comment that I thought this was a great suggestion (and
would they mind if I stole it) and suggestion the addition of a beauty
stat, for charisma and comiliness, guess you beat me to it ;)  Though I
agree that there is often a difference between manual dexterity and
agility, I don't like the idea of too many stats, I for one would not
like to see any more stats than this proposal...  I had the misfortune
to lose the file I had all my characters in, and had to reconstruct
them.  The AD&D chararacters were easy, they only had 6 stats out of 18,
but the role-master character had 10, with diff potentials and current
values, and the character concept I had wasn't detailed enough to help
me reconstruct 20 stats out of 100.  Not that this is relevant (and the
system I have been playing around with has stats basically out of 100
(though no limits...) but there are only 7 (yeah, I broke up dex)).

RoleMaster is really realistic, and the skills allow you to really
tailor a character, but the realism get in the way, it slows the game
down, and kills characters often (I'm from the school of thought that
believes that RPG are herioc fantasies, and though without danger the
game would be meaningless, I really hate to see my character die because
some kobold was really lucky and cut his head off with a bow critical)

That reminds me, another concept that my system has (I believe it is also
in another system, when I mentioned it to a friend he said something
along the lines of "oh, you mean like nn" where nn is some system I
can't remember, unfortuneately I have only been exposeed to AD&D and
RoleMaster (and a bit of paranoia, I helped write a MUD based on it
(unfortuneatly the machine is dead, before we could get it on to the
net, though it will be on as soon as we find another machine to finish
development on)) (don't you love nested brackets?  NO, I'm not a LISP
programmer)) and so don't get exposed to a lot of good ideas...),
anyway, I'm refering to hero points (I think nn == James Bond??), which
I based on charisma (all the trully great heros are charasmatic, right?
:) ), which players could spend on getting out of an impossible
situation (which makes me think it was James Bond :) ), modify saving
throws, to hit rolls, completeing an incredible manoveour, etc, etc.
Extra hero points could be rewarded by the DM for things like good
role-playing (where xp bonuses seem inappropriate, but the DM wishs to
give the player incentive or reward).

Anyone like/loathe the idea?  I like this thread, it's presented some
good ideas.

Damn, thought of something else ;)
I don't see the point of the suggestions of the gouping of stats, ie:
having a body score, which some things are rolled against, and then a
further more accurate set, which you use for other rols, if you have all
the values, why not always use the most appropriate?  Or is this meant
to be personal preferance?  You choose the level of detail for your
campaign?  Also the very detailed levels have alot more stats than I
personally like... But that's obviously just my personal preferance.

And if this is going to be skill based (which is my vote ;) how are we
going to do cleric magic?  This is the stumbling block in my system, the
reason why I haven't finished it.  The only (rather crude) solution I
thought of was making cleric magic == mage magic, and the clerics were
fooling themselves (though this of course is not apparent to the cleric,
he behaves as if it comes from his god, etc etc), due to church
brainwashing (not nessasarily known, there are good reasons why this may
be the way the first cleric discovered magic etc etc.)  But this IS is a
rather avoiding_the_issue solution, and though I don't like playing
clerics, I don't fell that I have the right to rip my cleric players off
(not that this system would nessasarily do this...)  Any ideas would be
appreciated, els I will just go with a convoluted cleric == mage magic
system, though justifying why clerics learn spells as skills ala mages
would be difficult...

ENOUGH! rambling for today.
Have fun, win awards,
