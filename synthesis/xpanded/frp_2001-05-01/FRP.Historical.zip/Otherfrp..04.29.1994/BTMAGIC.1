Subject: Simplified Spell System


The following is an excerpt from the Bardic Tales Revision 6 Chapter on Magic-
in progress.  Comments are welcome.

You may default to this if you have no or ambiguous spell information from me.
It is the BASIC level which is the easiest and quickest level of the rule set.
There are four levels: DESIGN, ADVANCED, STANDARD, and BASIC.  Most of you are
running in a cross between ADVANCED and STANDARD.  Only an idiot- or JIM and I-
would run the design level.  

__+__________+

BASIC RULES:	SPELL CASTING

These are the simplified rules for spell casting in Bardic Tales.  They are 
designed to be rule-of-thumb no-thought applications for quickie spell casting.  
They can be used by people who don't want to go too crazy with magic or want to 
do combats in a hurry.  If I have given you costs and data already your 
current information overrides this information.

 
			*** GENERAL INFO ***
 
A general skill can add three percent per rank in the general skill is the spell 
	is under the umbrella of the general skill.
Any Spell, Ritual, Rite or Invokation of the same basic type can be used as 
	a secondary (3% per rank)
Any other SCF skill even vaguely related can be used as a tertiary (1% per RANK)

MAGE_TRANCE:  Adds 15% plus 3% per RANK in MAGE TRANCE if successful.  Takes
	50 counts to implement.

SET_UP: Adds 2% per COUNT of set up up to KIF + 10 counts.  (If the casting is 
	measured in units other than counts the set up must also be measured in 
	those units.)

MAXIMUM_BONUSES ( _BON_ ): 1 general, 2 Secondaries, 2 tertiaries

MODS:  See Modifier sheet in Appendix A: General Play Data (includes: 
	fatigue (endurance and exhaustion), wounds (HTK and POW), and 
	environment (cover for targeting, movement)  Spell casting is run as 
	missile use.  

SPELL POINTS: 	Spell points are the things that power spells.  Spell points are 
		generated in basically three ways:
	1) Use of MENTAL ENDURANCE (MEN).  Ratio is one MEN equals one SPELL 
		POINT unless declared otherwise.  
		a) in basic rules return is one MEN per 10 counts.
			** ALEX NOTE:  In STANDARD rules use of 10 MEN costs one 
			** mental exhaustion (MEX).  The   formula for maximum MEN 
			** achievable through (a) above is 
			** MEN_CURRENT_ACHIEVABLE = MEN_TOTAL - MEX	**
	
	2) Use of POWER (POW). Ratio is one POW equals one SPELL POINT unless
		declared otherwise. 

	3) Use of a POWER source such as a battery, node line, or a feed
		from a thaumaturge or other source.  This still costs.  The cost
		is one MEN or POW for every 10 SPELL POINTS used. 

LANGUAGES, RUNES AND SCHOOLS FOR CASTING:

RITUALS, RITES, and INVOKATIONS require a LAnguage skill for the appropriate school
of magic and a RUne skill in the appropriate school of magic. SOme of them also require 
a skill in the school itself.  If you do not meet the minimum required levels you must 
roll under each skill you do not have and if you fail it is a -30 to your cast chance
for each failure.  See APPENDIX C: MAGIC DATA for the list of the schools of magic.  

For the BAsic RUles there is no overlap between schools and it is sufficient to write:  L:Evocation, R:Evocation, and W: Evocation on one's character sheet.  This will not be mentioned in the components section but applies to all of the of the next three levels.  These are the minimum required levels:  
	RITUAL:   	W: 0.0, L: 2.0, R: 2.0
	RITE:	  	W: 3.0, L: 4.0, R: 4.0
	INVOKATION:	W: 6.0, L: 6.0, R: 6.0

	Then way to resolve it if you don't have the mimimum is: 
	RANK*10 - (NEEDED_RANK - ACTUAL_RANK)*10 + Level Factor(SCF for W: 
		and R: but INF for L:)

COMPONENTS: Missing a component is ususally a -30 for each missing component.  Magical 
		preparation counts as one component, as does each object being prepared.

			*** TYPES OF SPELL CASTING ***

	5 types: Sorcery, Spells, Rites, Rituals, and Invokations

*** SORCERY

SEE SORCERY SHEET in APPENDIX C: MAGIC DATA

In the Sorcery sheet you are given difficulty mods ( _df_ ) for all sorceries.  FOr some 
you are given costs, area-of-effects and other data.  Information on SOrcery sheets
overrules this information.
Sorcery-> MOst basic form of spell casting.

	BASE CAST CHANCE:	RANK*10 + SCF + BON - DF + MODS - MDF(if targetted)
				     OR  Magical APtitude + RANK*3 + BON - DF + MODS
	CAST TIME:		10 counts ( up to 30 counts )
	SPELL POINT COST:	10 SPELL POINTS
	RANGE:			3*(AURA + RANK) in feet
	Area of Effect:		One object, person, or 3 feet cubed, or 1 foot^3 per rank
	SAVES:			Full magic save cancels effects or halves effect
	COMPONENTS:		None unless specified- act of will sufficient

*** SPELLS

Unless specified based on SORCERY sheet values of closest sorcery times 2... 
	INCLUDING Difficulty Factor (df)!

	BASE CAST CHANCE:	RANK*10 + SCF + BON - DF + MODS - MDF(if targetted)
	CAST TIME:		30 counts (up to 1 minute/300 counts)
	SPELL POINT COST:	20 SPELL POINTS 
	RANGE:			10*(AURA + RANK) in feet
	Area of Effect:		One object, person, or 6 feet cubed, or 2 foot^3 per rank
	SAVES:			Full magic save cancels effects or halves effect
	COMPONENTS:		Somatic and verbal componments required.  No language 
				or rune skilled required per say- ranks in spell sufficient.
				If trying without rank in spell L: <appropriate 
				school's Casting Language> and R: <appropriate school's 
				rune set> would have to be rolled against before casting.
				If normal failure comes off as a sorcery, if crit- can't 
				cast, because too confused.;-)
		  

*** RITUALS


Unless specified based on SORCERY sheet values of closest sorcery times 4... 
	INCLUDING Difficulty Factor (df)!

notes:

All ranges are in feet except those with (m); these are in miles.
Most sorceries can be held for multiple durations without rolling again
        so long as the base cost is paid over again.
Abbreviated stats refer to the object of the spell not the caster.
* requires a "read aura" to be going on simultaneously
** each level of mind after surface(thought, deep, and inner) costs
         another 10% to penetrate unless it is done one level at a time.
Astral travellers travel 5* faster than normal,  mind travellers can travel
        one mile per count or slower.
Personal ranges can be made into area of effects: by paying total cost
        for every aura/2 in feet radius; or by paying total cost for every 
        "aur cubic feet" of wall the caster wishes.
Mages draw in spell points at SCF/5 per count.  They always have SCF/2
        around them.
Achieving a mage trance gives 15% + 3% per rank in meditation.
Touch adds 10% + 1% per count in contact with a maximum of SCF but
        never lower than 10%.  "contact time" can include casting time!
You may set up at 2% per count to a maximum of 20+KIF counts or
        2*success chance whichever is lower to a minimum of 5%.
A critical miss occurs at chance +50.  Every 10 points above that adds another 
        level to the critical miss.
A general focus is worth +10 or 5 points of POW; a specific focus is 
        worth +20 or 10 points of POW; a personal focus is worth
        +30 or 15 points of POW.  A focus takes 5 cts to apply.




That's it!  Any questions?;-)  Sorcery sheet and school list to follow!
