        Weren't we going to make this RP system universal (i.e., commutable
among many genres, if not all)?  I think it's possible to have one system that
takes all possibilities into account; GO MODULAR!
        After all, the majority (must keep from terrocentrism, tho') of these
players will be human or human-esque.  "If you cut us, do we not bleed? If you
wrong us, crave we not revenge?" (badly quoted from _Merchant of Venice_ and
_Star Trek VI_.)
        We're dealing with people who are themselves dealing with, for the most
part, things done to them by other people.  Whether someone shoots at you with
a railgun, tosses a fireball at you, or attempts to shatter your ego via psi,
roleplaying is all a question of human reactions.  Only the numbers and how
they're juggled differ.
        I'm all in favor of this whole monster: modularity, pieces and parts,
being 100% (no percentile-preference; just idiom) *PUBLIC DOMAIN*!  No sellin',
no profitin', no nothin' but good clean free fun!
