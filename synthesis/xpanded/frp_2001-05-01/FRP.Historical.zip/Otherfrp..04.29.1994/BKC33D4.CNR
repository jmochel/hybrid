===============================================================================
     GMAST-L Role-Playing Game Designers' Guidelines, 12/10/92 (Proposed)
===============================================================================

Goal:

Discuss the problems of creating a role-playing game (RPG) and conceive a
well-designed RPG.


Subject:

For the purpose of this project, we will create a RPG in the Fantasy genre, due
to the fact that most designers are very familiar with the aspects of the
Fantasy genre and the common problems of FRPGs.

However, every effort should be made to make the RPG as general as possible, so
that new modules can be added to the RPG for other genres.  The only reason we
are limiting ourselves to Fantasy is to reduce the amount of work and provide a
more narrow focus.


Aspects:

As discussed, we will strive to satisfy many different aspects or mini-goals
that we find desirable in RPGs in general.  These aspects are detailed below.


1. Clarity

The rules -- and proposed rules! -- should be clearly written and easily
understood.

2. Efficiency

Whenever possible, rules should be in their _simplest form_.  This does not
imply that the rules cannot be complex, just that we need to strip away extra
baggage that is not necessary.  Game mechanics should be easy to use.
Eliminate tables, charts, and formulas whenever possible.  Mark optional rules
as such.

3. Skill-based

The foundation of the game system will be the attribute and skill systems.
There will be no _forced_ "classes" or "archetypes."  All other game systems
will be founded on the concept of skills.

4. Basis

Every term will be reduced, whenever possible and desirable, to its simplest
forms.  That means Dexterity might be reduced to Agility, Manual Dexterity,
Grace and Reflex, if this is desirable.

5. Modularity

The game should be composed of separate sections that can be removed and
replaced easily.  The sections should be independent of each other, but all
based on the same skill/attribute system.  It should be easy to add-in new
systems, such as a new type of magic system, and so on.

6. Scalability

As much as possible, the game should allow the players and GM to scale the
various systems to the levels of detail that they prefer.
