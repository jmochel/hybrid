    I agee here to a point. Dexterity for example usually cover physhical
grace, full body co-ordination, eye-hand co-ordination, and reflex speed.
Intelligence usually covers memory, learning, etc etc. My point being that you
can easily overdue it with stats (DM:" Roll your Breathing Strength Bob" " Which
page is that on again?"). The best idea, I think, is to only use stats that are
actually going to get rolled or checked against with any frequency.  For
example in converting the StarWars system to a Fantasy Setting I ditched the
Mechanical skill, it still covered Horse riding by really how many times in an
adventure is one likely to make a horse riding check.  Vampire: The Masquerade
has a good system for stats by the way in that it lists 3 sets of stats
(Physical, Social, and Mental) breaks them down into 3 stats per catergory and
then lets you specialize in a stat (for example your intelligence may be of the
Creative variety). This allows a wide difference in what "stats" players may
have with only a few real stats to worry about.

    The idea of multiple scales is perhaps a better idea here. Any system that
tries to rank the I-move-a-planet-cause-I-feel-like-it Superman with a crippled
Call of Cthulu character is deluding itself (yeah the Investigator has a
strength of 5 and Superman has a strenth of 250,965,750,400,843.2 and really
there's a dice method to handle this).
    Star Wars has a really workable idea here that involves giving things
(literally) different scales. In it characters may have a 4 dice blaster and a
star ship may have a 4 dice blaster but because a starship is 4 scales higher
than the character the handgun will (most likely) not even scratch the paint
who the starship cannon will might only vaporize the character if it rolls
poorly.  The way it works is that you Cap out the dice so that against things
of a higher scale higher dice rolls don't mean anything (for example a die cap
of 4 means that any die that comes up over 4 doesn't count). Conversely if you
get hit by the starship it's damage isn't capped, your strenth to resist is.

    Skill systems can be fun (I like Gurps and Champs too) but classes and
archteypes have their place to in that they give every character a role (or to
phrase that better an important role) to play in the story. In AD&D for example
the cleric enjoys the role of being the only one who can heal the party, the
Fighter enjoys the benifit of being the parties combat base, the one they'll
all fall back when their spells run dry etc etc.
    The best idea is probably a skill based system that favors classes but
allows you to make whatever you want if you really want to. In other words if
you really want to be that Sword weilding, Pocket Picking Mage you can but you
won't get the benifits of a "package deal" for it.

4. Modularity

   Modularity is good, so speaks the computer science student (me) who has had
that beat into his head for the past 4 years.

5. Scalability

   Also good.


6. Efficiency

   See 5.

7. Clarity

   A really important point this one is (Yoda speak). Nothing is perhaps more
important than example that highlight or explain tricky parts of the rules. If
you want a guide on how *NOT* to use examples read ShadowRun.  Anything that
might be confusing should be explained in an example and an extended (read 4 or
5 pages at least, 8 or 9 would be better) sample of game play should be
included.
