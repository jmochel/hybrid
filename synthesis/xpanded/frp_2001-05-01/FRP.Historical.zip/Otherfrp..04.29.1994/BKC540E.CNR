Here's what I'd like to do for the PD RPG...

Genre: Fantasy role-playing

Everyone is familiar with FRPGs -- the concepts, the problems, and so on.  It's
a wonderful framework to build in for that reason.  I suggest that the game
take a middle ground between high fantasy and low fantasy, to reach a wider
audience.


Systems: Completely Skill-based, Difficulty Levels

Skill-based systems allow an almost unlimited variety of characters.  By
avoiding classes/archetypes, an RPG tends to stress the "playing" part of
"role-playing," and not the role.

Difficulty levels allow progressive, and unlimited, scaling.  That is, this
kind of system can handle low scores (such as 5) in the same way it handles
high scores (such as 666,000) since the system simply adds numbers.


Complexity: Simpler, Believable, Less "Realistic"

Being a game of the Fantasy genre, I suggest a simpler approach to the rules.
I don't think I'm too far off base to say that people who want to play a FRPG
don't want to mess with a lot of time-consuming rules.

Systems such as combat and skill-adjudication should be believable, but need
not iron out every nuance of reality.  Systems for swordplay should be
entertaining and should allow players to use their PC's skills, and give them
a variety of option other than "I swing at it."

Realism is important to a degree.  However, since we are taking a middle ground
 between high and low fantasy, we need not concern ourselves with the blood &
guts of combat, and so on.  Playability should be the first concern; when we
reach the point where we are unwilling to sacrifice more playability, we
should let the system be.


Emphasis: Characters and Choices

The game should give players many choices about their characters and their
characters' actions.  Character generation should offer wide variety.  Combat
should do the same.  At all times, player creativity should be in the
spotlight.
