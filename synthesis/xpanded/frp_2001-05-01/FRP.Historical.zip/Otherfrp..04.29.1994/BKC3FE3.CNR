Ahhhh back on at last. NMSUVM1 went fooooofie. Anway, my reader had 1000000
bajillion notes on this game design thing, so I'll throw in something:


I like the categories proposed by Adam Dray, and have a few comments.

I have liked the hero system in that it succeeds in many of these areas,
particularly modularity (much more so with Champs 4). It fails somewhat in the
simplicity area, and the ambiguity of rules and advantages/limits often really
gets confusing (ie: does X limit apply before or after I multiply, does it
affect this, does it affect endurance, etc etc...).

One stat I always thought seemed to be missing from champs though was a SIZE
stat. 1 level of growth, always on, 0 end, persistent (etc) seems like an
awful clumsy way to say "he's taller" and 12 level shrinking etc. etc
is a clumsy way to say "he's short." Also, the height is kind of ambiguous
in Champs, since you can have a "normally" sized guy be anywhere from five to
eight feet tall. Thus a "normal" shrunk person is from 2 1/2 to 4 feet tall,
a sizable (heh heh) difference. I have no proposal as such, but it seems as
though this could be fixed.

As for efficiency, hero can shares with gurps the problem of minimaxing: that
someone who knows the system can really stack up the limits or add some obscure
rule or another and get away with a muderously efficient character that is real
cheap.
The worst example (unsuccessful, but humorous for its blatancy) is this one:
someone wanted to have THE Excalibur. His idea was it had a lot of ego powers
(don't ask me why), but it was tooooo expensive the way he wanted it. So
he bought it as (get this) an intelligent follower, OAF. Thus be made a multi-
power that was bought with scads of power at 1/5 the cost (follower rules) then
divided by 1/2 again (OAF, the sword Excalibur.) It ended up costing him 5
points (hah). Not only that, but since it was a follower, he didn't pay END for
using it, the sword did. Pretty neat hu?
