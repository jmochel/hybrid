I agree, but we're in the 90's now, and people generally want more than
just a good set of attributes.

I've asked around, and from what I've heard, no one really wants a scalable
attribute system.  After all, the attribute is generally the foundation of
any role-playing game.  A veteran gamer can identify any game by the list
of attributes it uses.

Quick!  What RPG uses Body, Dex, Learning, and Charisma?  Any takers?
How about Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and
Charisma?  Tough one, I know...  =)

Many of the aspects I listed in the original Checklist were contradictory;
working toward one of them might mean a loss in another.  Our trick is to
maximize them (Efficiency) all without sacrificing playability and
originality.

Like I said earlier -- let's pretend we're creating a Universal RPG with
a Fantasy supplement, so we have an interesting game when we're done.

Dead as Trigger.  Stuff it and mount it.

We don't want to produce a game that takes a great deal of setup by the GM.
The game should be ready to play out of the laser printer!

Hmmm.  Our system could be SO ABSTRACT that ... you don't even need to
play!  You wouldn't even need a single stat!  You'd just roll lots of dice,
nod a lot, and mutter "mmm-hmmm!"  and "Yes!".

The task resolution system is one of the most important systems in the
game.  We MUST settle on this before any kind of progress is to be made.
Sorry if I seem a bit tyrannical here, but this is one point I absolutely
will not bend on.  Well, I will if I have to, but I really, really feel
strongly about this.  How about the other designers?  <Help!>

Nice speech. <cough>  You mention a lot of goals and concepts, but you have
yet to try to adapt what the list has already produced to your ideas.
_Show_ us something and we'll take a look at it.  You seem to have quite a
complex about this whole group project thing.  This is no place for rampant
egos.  We all have to bend a bit.

I just think that there isn't much interest in a completely modular
attribute system.

What do you mean?  Do you mean I was dreaming when I conceived that list?
Surely, I admit it is a lofty goal to produce such a game, but it is only
meant as a model to work towards.  If we don't reach all those goals, at
least we'll know we came as close as possible.

Your list of credits is very, very impressive.  However, I must insist that
if your account is getting flooded with catastrophic amounts of seemingly
worthless, or at least aggravating, material -- delete it.

A couple weeks, huh?  You can return the favor by offering constructive
criticism and new ideas, like we all try to do.



        One of the things that they teach us in ROTC is "Don't reinvent the
wheel." If something has been done by somebody else and it works, then
change/adapt that to what you want to do. In reference to designing an RPG,
why not take the basic ideas that other games have and build upon them? The
companies that make these games have tested their ideas and made sure that
they work. [Except for 1st Ed. Mechwarrior. ;)] One of the things that you'll
notice among the more popular RPG's is their simplicity. AD&D and Shadowrun
are games that I would say are fairly simple yet complex enough for people
to play and enjoy. My first suggestion would be to take a look at the games
that are popular and flexible and take ideas from them.

Matt, we started this project last Friday.  It wasn't until Monday that we
actually decided to make a RPG instead of just talk about them.
Considering that the project is, in essence, only two days old, I'd say
we're on our way to doing a damn fine job of organizing it.  I've been
refining suggestions and reposting them, incorporating everyone's ideas
into them.

However, I am in no way the project leader, nor am I unbiased.  I have very
strong opinions on some matters, though I am willing to give in if need be.
I only assumed this role because I had some free time and I wrote the
original Checklist (and so was familiar with the Guidelines).

I am slightly put off by a newcomer who wants to step into a brand new
project and tell us all we should do things his way or else give up.
That's not good leadership, it's egotism.

Personally, I prefer a full mailbox to an empty one.  Almost all of the
Game Design posts have been clearly marked as such in the subject headers.
Just delete the posts with "RPG:" or "GD:" in them.

If you're interested on working on the project, I suggest getting used to
lots of mail.  We all have a lot of ideas that we want to voice.  To
accomplish anything in a reasonable amount of time, we need to respond
often, and the mail will pile up.  But it's mostly interesting mail.


I would like to restate that we should concentrate on one or two areas at
a time, based on the Order of Business that I posted.  The first thing on
the Order of Business is, of course, to get an okay on the Order of
Business and the Guidelines.  The Guidelines will be our primary means of
judging the merit of ideas; secondary is creativity and originality.

							Adam.
