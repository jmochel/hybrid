1.  Creating a universal game for the PD is a very very good idea.
    However, I do not think we should do it on this list.  What
    we should do is creat our own list, via distribution files,
    and find somewhere to keep our archives.

2.  Over the summer I participated in the Ultimate Dungeon Project, which
    was a similar collaborative effort for a similar (tho not the same)
    aim.  That project suffered from a couple of problems that we would
    do well to avoid:

                a) To large a conception.  The project (the biggest
                        dungeon ever, was way too big.  Part of the problem
                        was finding out where to begin.
                b) All talk, no action.  The list was deluged with bickering
                        back and forth over the smallest organisation
                        details.  (I participated in it too, twas a terrible
                        thing.)  Organisation became the prime occupation
                        and it overshadowed getting any work done.
                c) Inability to decide/agree upon a unifying design philosophy.
                        Just about every single member of the UD project had
                        his own conception of what the UD project would be.
                        It ended up with splinter-groups pretty much going
                        out on their own.  The project lost its center, in
                        effect.
                d) The prime problem: E-Mail is not a very good place for
                        conference discussions of this type.  Oh well.

3.   Maybe we can surmount these problems.  Maybe not.  I think that if
     we could somehow decide on a unifying game-basis; (a generic multi-genre,

     is an idear) and then go off singly or in very small groups to create
     the various parts.  I.E. if we go for a fantasy game; 1 person handles
     skills, another races, anothe r classes, -- but even that approach might
     not work.  I'm out of ideas -- anyone else care to jump in?
