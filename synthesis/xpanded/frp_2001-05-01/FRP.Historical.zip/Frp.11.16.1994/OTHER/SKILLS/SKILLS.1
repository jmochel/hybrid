Subject: FUDGE skill variants...

Well, I and my best friend have been designing and discussing game design
by our selves, sans internet, for years now. And we have some guidlines as
to what makes a good game. On of these is that there should be a balance
between the use of stats and that of skills. Unfortunatly, in the FUDGE
system, skills and stats are not related. Here's some changes to correct
that:

All skills fall into one of three groups: Talents (things anyone can do);
Training (things most people in the society can do, but need specialized
training to get really good at); and Knowledges (things you need to go to
college or someplace similar to learn.)

Default values for these are:
Talents: stat
Training: stat - 2
Knowledges: no ability

(For those of you who don't like assigning one specific stat to a skill,
then buy the skill at a + or - level: ie, spending a point on the Talent
"brawl" would give a "brawl +1", adding one to the value of whatever stat
was being used to control it.)

Fortunately, I'd say.  You can do some truly wonderful, flexible
character creation if you throw the relationship between skills and
stats out the window.  The latest version of FUDGE has two sops to the
camp that thinks they should be related: High attribute gives a bonus
to skills at default, and high attributes can make buying skills with
EP cheaper.  That's as far as I'm willing to go.

Exactly as FUDGE does it, if you change the word stat to Fair.

Thanks for the suggestion - suggestions are always welcome in FUDGE.
But in this case, I won't take it, sorry.  I refuse to allow an
attribute to govern the default of a skill.  This is because I've
played GURPS for eight years, and seen too much abuse of high IQ and
high DX.  The same thing would happen in FUDGE with this suggestion:
people using the Objective Character creation system would trade all
their skill levels to get all the attributes at high levels.  You'd
have everybody with Superb Dexterity and Superb Intelligence, meaning
75% of their skills would be at Good for free!  Nor do I wish to
introduce a kludge to prevent this.  I think it far better simply to
say, as I've done, that if a player is offended by the lack of
relationship between skills and attributes, it's up to him to make them
correspond.  This is a far more FUDGE-like attitude.


Subject: Re: FUDGE skill variants...

Hey, it was only a suggestion guy, don't get testy on me :-{

Anyway, the point I don't like (honest criticism) about having the players
correspond stats + skills is that why should I, as a player, waste more
points on stats than on skills?

I've been roleplaying now for about nine years, and in all that time,
through about five gaming groups and almost a dozen systems, I haven't seen
one (with the obvious exeption of DnD) that relies equally for rolls on
both stats and skills, since it can be (quite better than I can) argued
that most actions a person takes are learned, and not in-born.

Now, obvious ways to get around this are to generalize stats more and make
skills intesive-specific, but that only works in some genre's (ie: Starwars
does it). Or to get rid of either stats or skills entirely, and only have
one. I believe some game somewhere did this.

I would also argue that stat-based skills make sense: you have to start
somewhere, and I, being naturally more intelligent ( and humble :) ) than
Jim Pasky (trust me, you've never met jim ;) ), would be naturally better
than him in things like ... driving or whatever (the examples not good, but
you get the point.) He'd have to spend time to reach the point that I start
at.

And the way to get around players abusing the system is to liberally
slather the phrase "GM discretion" all over the place. After all, it's the
game that counts, not the rules (I'm saying this as a former rule-monger
myself -- and I still am, to a point "know the rules so you know what
you're breaking")

But these are just argument to support my point. PLEASE do not change FUDGE
for me. I like it the way it is.

PS: What _is_ a "fudge-like attitide". I thought it was: do what you want,
and ignore the rules. Their only guidlines.

I just wanted someone else to speak for Steffan.  Please go back and read
his reply again.  It wasn't testy at all.

He honestly does appreciate input--I gave him lots, and he has rejected lots
of that.  (I've rejected lots of his, too, vehemently enough that he dropped
them.  :-)  Lots of ideas in FUDGE are either from me or affected by my
comments.  In Steffan's reply to you, he thanks you for your suggestion,
but graciously refuses.  One of the reasons FUDGE has turned out so well
is that one author has kept a guiding hand on how it goes.  By contrast,
the NET.RPG that was once being developed not only could never get beyond
the suggestion phase, it never could get being an accumulation of extremely
varied, not necessarily connected concepts.  So don't take a rejection
personally, and I really don't think that his response had any bad feelings
at all in it.  Then again, I've known him (electronically, and we met once)
for a little while (well, OK, for about a year), and may be more used to
reading electronic messages.

   PS: What _is_ a "fudge-like attitide". I thought it was: do what you want,

Fudge-like attitude is doing what you think is best for a particular situation.
It fits both the GMs and the rules.  GMs have to do some rules-adjusting
themselves.  But the rules have to exhibit fudge-like attitude, so we don't
want to give many rules that not everyone will like.  We'd rather have a GM
who thinks it is important apply a rule on top of the system (like requiring
a connection between skills and attributes) than require GMs to ignore that
rule.

If I was testy, I apologize.  I admit I shot it down rather strongly,
but I don't really feel an animosity towards you, honest!

Actually, the GM is given many examples throughout the ms. on when to
make attribute rolls.  When I GM, I use attributes quite a fair bit.

>I would also argue that stat-based skills make sense: 

Hmmm . . . I see a basic conflict between this statement and the
previous one.  Stat-based skills make sense to you, but if given the
choice, you'll make a character with low stats and high skills?  Why?

Actually, if stat-based skills make sense to you, I recommend GURPS.
What FUDGE can do that GURPS can't do, however, is make someone with a
high stat and widely varying skills that would be dependent on that
stat.  Yet I contend that this is as realistic as the other way - I
know many instances of such occurance in real life.  I consider myself
fairly intelligent, but I'm downright miserable at hard sciences.  I'm
pretty good at math, though - so go figure.  How can you make a
character Terrible in Physics and Chemistry but Good in Math, Great in
17th-century History, with at least a Good IQ if you demand that skills
be stat based?  (And if my GRE scores are any indication - 792 in
mathematical and 735 in verbal, my IQ might be better than Good.)

>And the way to get around players abusing the system is to liberally

FUDGE has this more than any other game already, most likely.  Do I
really need to say it again?  Why can't the GM discretion go the other
way: *make* them take stats appropriate to their skills?

>PS: What _is_ a "fudge-like attitide". I thought it was: do what you want,

I fully admit this is an extremely subjective phrase.  I meant, at the
time I said it, that FUDGE is freeform.  It's much easier to be
freeform with less rules and more guidelines than the opposite.

At any rate, I'm sorry if my reply caused hard feelings - none
intended.

  Actually, no it's not, I just had a problem expressing it: given a system
where skills are not based on stats, I'll (as the greedy-player steriotype)
take more skills than stats.

I've tried GURPS. It works very well until: you add guns or stats go above
14. Then it breaks down. No systems perfect. No even FUDGE :)

Alright, I will try to recoup from my defeat and find something that _will_
grab your attention. You've been warned :)
