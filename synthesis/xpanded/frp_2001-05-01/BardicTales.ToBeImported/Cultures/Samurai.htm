<H1>Samurai</H1></CENTER>
<HR>
The family and clan of a samurai are very important to him. their history is his 
history and their honor is his honor. A character with a small family will tend 
to be less arrogant than one with a large family. Good family connections can 
increase arrogance independently from family size. 
<HR>
<I>A master should not unreasonably make requests for the possessions of his 
retainers, such as their horses and falcons, or their swords, naginatas, 
paintings or Chinese goods. generally speaking, for retainers to possess 
valuable articles is the same as if the master himself possessed them. <BR>
<CENTER>(The Recorded Words of Asakura Soteki)</CENTER>
<HR>
</I>Samurai families exist in a web of bonds and duties. Families join together 
into clans to share and increase political and military influence. The families 
associated in a clan may expect considerations and support from each other. 
Oaths, intermarriage, adoption, land grants, stipends, and the exchange of 
younger members for training bind the families closer together. "Connected" 
families use all of the above methods to assure receipt of desired favors and to 
extend influence. A family can use its "connections" for its own gain. It must 
expect, however, to be called upon by those same "connections" to perform 
services and duties in return. 
<P>Vassals, whether individuals or whole families, can be bound into a family or 
clan structure. They are given most of the same rights, privileges, and 
responsibilities as those who are members of the group by birth. Vassals may 
expect considerations and support from their lords in return for their loyalty 
and service. In most cases a lord is responsible under the law for his vassal as 
if the vassal were a member of his family. In counterpoint, the vassal must 
follow the direction of his lord as a loyal son would follow his father's 
wishes. 
<P>Samurai clans often join together in greater alliances. The structure of such 
an alliance resembles that of a clan, but with entire clans filling the niche 
that families fill within a simple clan. Such allied clans use the same methods 
to bind their member clans that clans use to bind member families. The Taira and 
Minamoto of the Gempei War were clans of this sort, as were many of the rival 
powers contending in the wars leading to the Tokugawa unification of Nippon. 
<HR>
<I>It is not good to be feared by one's own retainers. It has been passed down 
from ages past that it is fundamental to value one's retainers' deep devotion. 
If such is not the case, when the time comes it will be difficult for them to be 
valuable to you by throwing away their lives. <BR>
<CENTER>(The Recorded Words of Asakura Soteki)</CENTER>
<HR>
</I>The clan is as much a political organization as a family group. Clan laws 
are civil laws. The clan dispenses justice, maintains order, provides military 
strength, and collects taxes. Whithin its territory the clan rules with most of 
the prerogatives held by a king in medieval Europe. Only a strong shogun can 
force outside authority upon a powerful clan. 
<P>The lord of the clan is advised by a council of elders, generals, and senior 
clan members. Trusted clan members are given the title of <I>hatamoto</I>, a 
proud and noble rank for favored retainers who hold important positions or have 
significant fiefs. The rank of <I>gokenin</I> is given to senior and proven clan 
members. Below these are the rank and file samurai, the heart and sinews of the 
clan. 
<CENTER>
<H1>Samurai Society</H1></CENTER>
<HR>
<I>In all things there is a comprehensive attutude that is important to have, 
but generally, there are few of these times who have thought this through to a 
clear understanding. 
<P>First, a man whose profession is the use of arms should think and then act 
upon not only his own fame, but also that of his descendants. He should not 
scandalize his name forever by holding his one and only life too dear. On the 
other hand, in the light of this, to consider this life that is given to us only 
once as nothing more than dust and ashes, and lose it at a time when one should 
not, would be to gain a reputation that is not worth mentioning. One's main 
purpose in throwing away his life is to do so either for the sake of the Emperor 
or in some great undertaking of a military general. It is exactly that will be 
the great fame of one's descendants. 
<P>To be involved in some epheremal quarrel will demonstrate the indiscretion of 
one's house and will not add to one's fame, regardless of being in the right or 
wrong. <BR>
<CENTER>(The Chikubasho of Shiba Yoshimasa)</CENTER></I>
<H2>Honor</H2>To a samurai, his honor is everything. It encompasses his castle 
and station as well as his accomplishments and deeds. It is, in a very real 
sense, his reputation. 
<CENTER>
<H1>Personal Virtues</H1></CENTER>The most important virtues for a samurai are 
adherence to the code of <I>bushido</I> and fullfillment of the obligations of 
<I>giri</I>. The code of bushido relies heavily on giri, while the performance 
of duties demanded by giri are often modified or reinforced by the dictates of 
bushido. Both are influenced by Confucian ethics and religious beliefs. 
<P><I>Bushido</I> means quite literally "The Way of the Warrior." It developed 
as a personal and professional code of conduct among the samurai, and spread its 
influence into all walks of Nipponese life. Its meaning was transmitted through 
teachings and lists of precepts presented by clan elders and outstanding 
warriors. Versions of the code were not written down as such until the sixteenth 
century. From these sources, as well as later explanations and earlier literary 
representations of the notable virtues of a samurai, a picture of the elements 
of bushido can be developed. 
<P><I>Giri</I> refers to the web of obligations and duties owed by a person to 
those around him: parents, family, and friends as well as feudal superiors and 
inferiors. 
<HR>
<I>If one were to say in a word what the condition of being a samurai is, its 
basis lies first in seriously devoting one's body and soul to his master. And if 
one is asked what to do beyond this, it would be to fit oneself inwardly with 
intelligence, humanity and courage. The combining of these three virtues may 
seem unobtainable to the ordinary person, but it is easy. Intelligence is 
nothing more than discussing things with others. Limitless wisdom comes from 
this. Humanity is something done for the sake of others, simply comparing 
oneself with them and putting them in the fore. Courage is gritting one's teeth; 
it is simply doing that and pushing ahead, paying no attention to the 
circumstances. Anything that seems above these three is not necessary to be 
known. 
<P>As for outward aspects there are personal appearance, one's way of speaking, 
and calligraphy. And as all of these are daily matters, they improve by constant 
practice. Basically, one should perceive their nature to be one of quiet 
strength. If one has accomplished all these things, then he should have a 
knowledge of our area's history and customs. After that he may study the various 
arts as recreation. If you think it over, being a retainer is simple. And these 
days, if you observe people who are even a bit useful, you will see that they 
have accomplished these three outward aspects. <BR>
<CENTER>(Hagakure of Yamamoto Tsunetomo)</CENTER>
<HR>
</I>
<H2>The Elements of Bushido</H2>Bushido is the ethical code of the samurai, and 
is composed of many elements: Loyalty, Honor, Courage, Refinement, and 
Excellence. 
<H3>Loyalty</H3>Loyalty is the paramount virtue of the samurai. A samurai's 
loyalty is given first to a feudal superior, then to his clan, then to his 
family. Loyalty to the emperor is, of course, of great importance although this 
rarely had any practical effect on a samurai's actions. Conflicting loyalties 
are common and simple solutions are rare. In severe cases, a samurai's 
resolution to a conflict may be to commit seppuku. 
<HR>
<I>When one is serving officially or in the master's court, he should not think 
of a hundred or a thousand people, but should consider only the importance of 
the master. Nor should he draw the line at his own life or anything else he 
considers valuable. Even if the master is being phlegmatic and one goes 
unrecognized, he should know that he will surely have the divine protection of 
the kami and Buddhas. <BR>
<CENTER>(The Message of Gokurakuji-dono)</CENTER></I>
<HR>
It is a samurai's duty to serve his superior, whether that superior is a 
military commander, a feudal overlord, a clan official, or the head of his 
family. A superior's orders are not to be questioned. They are to be followed 
immediately and to the fullest of the samurai's ability, even if this leads to 
unhappiness or death. A retainer's life belongs to his lord. It is to be 
preserved or spent as the lord wills. 
<P>This is the ideal. In practice, orders are disobeyed, ignored, and modified. 
A samurai's reasons for doing so can vary. A disloyal but ambitious might seek 
to improve his own position; if he is successful, his breach of the code may be 
overlooked. A loyal samurai might disobey as well. He might do this knowing (or 
fearing) that his lord is mistaken in issuing a particular order, or seeing a 
better course of action. If he is right, and successful, and can maintain his 
lord's honor, he may be forgiven his breach. If he is wrong, seppuku may be the 
result. 
<P>Obviously this is the foundation of bushido, and yet almost all of Nippon's 
major battles were decided by sudden defections and backstabbings. The major 
daimyos all knew this and made allowance for its happening, because it was so 
common. If a samurai family saw a chance to gain more land by switching sides, 
they often did so without hesitation. This was an endemic problem particularly 
in the 14th century. In fact some families split down the middle to ensure that 
enough of the family would end up on the winning side to survive. 
<H3>Honor</H3>Honor, for a samurai, is a combination of integrity and 
reputation. Lying, oathbreaking, and cheating are dishonorable. Indeed, many 
consider lying an act of cowardice. A samurai's word is his bond, although 
sometimes the letter of a statement or agreement is followed rather than the 
apparent intent. 
<HR>
<I>Because of some business, Morooka Hikeomon was called upon to swear before 
the gods concerning the truth of a certain matter. But he said, "A samurai's 
word is harder than metal. Since I have impressed this fact upon myself, what 
more can the kami and Buddhas do?" and the swearing was cancelled. This happened 
when he was twenty-six. <BR>
<CENTER>(Hagakure of Yamamoto Tsunetomo)</CENTER>
<HR>
</I>The Nipponese concern with reputation and appearances are well known. 
Excellence in martial virtues or the arts, as well as acts in accordance with 
bushido or the demands of giri, bring honor while inferior performance, 
inattention to duty, and acts in opposition to bushido will lessen a man's 
honor. A samurai's honor must be maintained, and a samurai will go to great 
lengths and perform strenuous deeds to restore lost honor. The thought of dying 
with tarnished honor is a nightmare to a samurai. The honor of a retainer and 
his lord are tied together and that which affects one affects the other. A loyal 
samurai holds his lord's honor higher than his own. 
<HR>
<I>A man exists for a generation, but his name lasts to the end of time. <BR>
<CENTER>(Hagakure of Yamamoto Tsunetomo)</CENTER></I>
<HR>

<H3>Courage</H3>Courage is more than simple bravery. A samurai is expected to 
face adversity at need, or at his lord's command, without qualm or hesitation. 
Physical pain is to be endured without emotion. Death holds no fear for a 
samurai. A death in battle is most certainly honorable. Yet a samurai's courage 
should not be reckless and foolhardy. To die unnecessarily while the cause of 
one's lord remains in doubt shows a lack of loyalty to that lord. 
<H3>Refinement</H3>Refinement in all things is expected of a samurai. 
Proficiency in martial skills is called for by his profession as a warrior. It 
is equally expected that he develop an appreciation of and proficiency in the 
arts. His manners and etiquette should be flawless. 
<HR>
<I>It is said that the warrior's is the twofold Way of pen and sword, and he 
should have a taste for both Ways. Even if a man has no natural ability, he can 
be a warrior by sticking assiduously to both divisions of the Way. <BR>
<CENTER>The Book of Five Rings</CENTER></I>
<HR>

<H3>Excellence</H3>The code of bushido calls strongly for excellence. A samurai 
is expected to always strive to be the best he can, at whatever he attempts. 
This drive towards excellence gives a samurai the determination to strive 
bravely and achieve his goals. 
<HR>
<I>Although the mean is the standard for all things, in military affairs a man 
must always strive to outstrip others... In the stories of the elder warriors it 
is said that on the battlefield if one wills himself to outstrip warriors of 
accomplishment, and day and night hopes to strike down a powerful enemy, he will 
grow indefatigable and fierce of heart and will manifest courage. One should use 
this principle in everyday affairs too. <BR>

<H2>The Obligations of Giri</H2>
<HR>
<I>Death is a feather, duty is a mountain. <BR>
<CENTER>(old Japanese proverb)</CENTER></I>
<HR>
Giri refers to the obligations and responsibilities of a samurai to do what is 
expected of him in every aspect of his life. It is sometimes simply translated 
as "duty." Giri requires a samurai to obey and abide by traditional customs 
(such as those regarding familial duties, marriage, and gifts) and to perform 
any tasks assigned to him. The demands of justice, honor, and reputation are 
deeply bound up with giri. A samurai is dishonored for failing a giri 
obligation. 
<P>A samurai is expected to discharge the obligations of giri even though it may 
be unpleasant or result in unhappiness for him or for others for whom he cares. 
Sometimes the demands of giri can conflict, either with other giri demands or 
with the samurai's personal wishes or feelings. Common conflicts pit duty 
against "human feelings" (ninjo) such as mercy or love. This can leave a samurai 
with no course but to act improperly according to one obligation in order to 
fulfill another. In extreme cases, the conflict can only be honorably resolved 
by seppuku. 
<P>Once a samurai named Kanzaki Shikibu found himself in a giri conflict. He was 
ordered to escort his lord's son to the Chimshima Islands. Shikibu's only son, 
Katsutaro, accompanied him on the journey. Along the way a fellow samurai 
entrusted to Shikibu's care one of his sons, Tanzaburo, who wished to travel to 
the islands. At a river crossing that samurai's son was accidentally drowned. 
Shikibu had to atone for his failure in the obligation to protect Tanzaburo. 
Shikibu could replace the samurai's loss by giving Katsutaro to him but that 
would take time and Shikibu's giri to his lord required that he countinue on at 
once. Shikibu faced a dilemma: 
<HR>
<I>He thought for a while and then summoned his som. "Tanzaburo's father 
entrusted his son's safety to me," he said, "but I let him die. If you remain 
alive, I will not be able to fulfill my duty to Lord Tango and preserve my honor 
as a samruai. And so you yourself must die at once." 
<P>Katsutaro, with true samurai spirit, showed not the slightest hesitation. He 
turned back, dove into the seething waves, and was never seen again. For some 
time, Shikibu stood by the river and contemplated the way of the world. 
<P>"Truly, nothing is so heartbreaking as fulfilling the claims of duty. ... I 
too would like to die here, but it would be a terrible thing if I disobeyed my 
lord's orders to accompany his son." <BR>
<CENTER>(Tales of Samurai Honor 1:5)</CENTER></I>
<HR>

<H2>Politeness</H2>Politeness is expected of all Nipponese, in all walks of 
life. Many verbs have both a normal and a polite form. Honorifics are often 
appended to names to indicate that the speaker shows proper respect for the 
person to whom he is speaking. Good form and proper etiquette in performing any 
act are well regarded. 
<HR>
<I>There was to Lord Eirin's character many high points difficult to measure, 
but according to the elders the foremost of these was the way he governed the 
province by his civility. It goes without saying that he acted this way toward 
those in the samurai class, but he was also polite in writing letters to the 
farmers and townspeople, and even in addressing these letters he was gracious 
beyond normal practice. In this way, all were willing to sacrifice their lives 
for him and become his allies. <BR>
<CENTER>(The Recorded Words of Asakura Soteki)</CENTER></I>
<HR>

<H2>Fatalism</H2>Fatalism is common among Nipponese. Things considered lucky or 
unlucky breaks among Europeans are considered to be due to fate, or karma. They 
are the benefits of a good deed or the repayment of a bad one in a former life. 
Yet, it is a practical fatalism which expects a samurai always to try his best. 
After all, failure will be bad karma for a future incarnation. 
<H2>Attitudes Towards Money</H2>Money is of little concern to a samurai. It is 
beneath his dignity to haggle with merchants. Thus samurai often pay exorbitant 
prices without question when unscrupulous merchants exploit this attitude. 
Monetary matters are the province of the female head of a household. The 
honor-conscious samurai woman has, on more than one occasion, secretly sold her 
own treasures to maintain her lord's appearances, lifestyle, and holdings. The 
samurai find wealth in beauty and other things, to whit: 
<HR>
<I>However, to oppress the people and covet the possessions of the samurai in 
one's desire to become quickly prosperous is absolutely laying the foundation of 
the destruction of the fief. 
<P>Precious metals and jewels are not necessarily treasures. Rather, one should 
consider his samurai and the common people as his wealth, and bring them up with 
gentleness and benevolence. Gold and silver are not necessarily to be recklessly 
accumulated; and when one receives wealth and distinction naturally through 
years of meritorious deeds, no disasters are likely to follow. <BR>
<CENTER>(Notes on Regulations by Kuroda Nagamasa)</CENTER>
<HR>
</I>The heimin find such disdain of money foolish. To them, haggling is a joy. 
Money is their principal route to a higher position in society, if not for 
themselves then for their descendants. 
<H2>Membership in a Social Group</H2>The group as an entity is a central concept 
to the Nipponese at all levels of society. A group can be a clan, a family, a 
trade, a neighborhood, an economic stratum, or some combination of these. 
Outsiders are objects of suspicion and distrust. Letters of introduction by 
members or friends of the group are common methods of bypassing barriers to 
acceptance. 
<P>The individual is subordinate to the group. His desires and wishes may be 
satisfied only after the welfare of the group is assured. What is good for the 
group is good for the individual. 
<P>The converse of this is that responsibility is often placed on the group for 
the acts of individual members. Such responsibility most often focuses on the 
elder or nominal head of the group. Sometimes entire families or villages suffer 
punishment for the actions of one of their members. The usual result of group 
responsibility is that Nipponese groups elect to police their own members and to 
mete out punishment before the matter reaches outsiders. Such prompt action can 
restore whatever honor was lost due to the wrongdoer's actions. 
<P>The importance of the social group cannot be emphasized enough. It exists 
from the very top to the very bottom of society, and every group is stratified 
within itself. There are very few "equals" in Nipponese society. Somebody is 
always above someone else. 
<HR>
<I>A man may not live under the same sky as the slayer of his father. <BR>
<CENTER>Confucius</CENTER></I>
<HR>

<H1>The Family</H1>A samurai holds his family in high esteem. It is his home, 
his history, and his future. It is said that any action by a son or daughter on 
behalf of the parents, nomatter how self-sacrificing it may be, cannot repay the 
tiniest fraction of the debt owed. Filial duty is required under the laws of 
heaven. A child may not disobey the wishes of a parent even after the child has 
grown, unless he wishes dishonor and shame. 
<P>The samurai family is an extended family. Parents, their children, and their 
children's children as well as uncles and aunts, often share the same roof. A 
man's wife leaves her own family behind to join her husband's household, never 
to return to her parents' home except as a visitor or if sent home as a 
childless widow or in disgrace. Rich samurai often take concubines into their 
homes. Such women serve under the wife who herself serves under the senior 
female of the household (usually the husband's mother). The ultimate authority 
in the family resides with the patriarch of the family. He makes or approves all 
major family decisions. Under the law, he is responsible for the actions of any 
family member. His wife is undisputed ruler of household affairs. 
<P>Children are treated with great kindness and leniency. Tradition condemns any 
abusive treatment of the young. Until the age of seven, children are exempt from 
the strictures of society. At that age their formal schooling starts and the 
weight of Nipponese society begins to descend upon them. Young samurai males 
shave their forelocks at their coming of age ceremonies, which may occur at any 
time between the ages of 13 and 21. 
<P>Inheritance is at the discretion of the lord. The firstborn son is normally 
named as heir to prevent dispersing family holdings. This principle was strongly 
enforced during the Tokugawa period. Before that time, inheritance was haphazard 
at best. In the 14th century, it was common to divide holdings among all sons 
(and sometimes daughters). In other periods land was given to the most competent 
son regardless of position. Hence, succession disputes occurred because there 
<I>were</I> no set rules. 
<P>Sometimes a likely heir is adopted into the family to assure a strong hand to 
maintain control over the family's holdings. Such adopted children, who may not 
even be children at all but grown adults, join the family as if they had been 
born to it. The greatest of the Uesugi family, Uesugi Kenshin, was actually a 
vassal named Nagao who saved his (younger) master from destruction on condition 
he be named heir. He then led the Uesugi family to greather heights than ever. 
Adoption into families, sometimes forced, is often used by self-made warlords to 
legitimize their holdings and improve their social status. 
<P>Strong bonds tie a samurai to his family. When a samurai takes service 
outside his family or clan, most of his loyalty is transferred to his new lord. 
Loyalty to a lord is intense, often greater that gaiven to the emperor or 
shogun. This is right and proper according to the code of bushido, but it can 
lead to conflicts. More than one samurai has found himself placed in a position 
where, to follow a lord's order, he must harm or allow to be harmed a member of 
his family. Sometimes, to save family honor, a lord must be disobeyed. This is a 
conflict of giri and, if it cannot be resolved with honor on both sides, the 
only solution may be seppuku. 
<P>Samurai families bond together into clans. A single family heads the clan and 
gives the clan its name. The main part of the clan is composed of cadet 
branches; families of relatives, both near and distant; and samurai vassals of 
all degrees. All members owe loyalty to the lord of the clan, the head of the 
principal army. 
<H1>Social Structure</H1>In Nippon an individual always knows where he or she 
stands in relation to other individuals. Respect for superiors, acknowledgement 
of obligations to inferiors, and proper courtesy are expected of all. Yet within 
this seemingly rigid society is a tradition of reward for personal merit which 
can lead to advancement and improved social position. No leader can afford to 
let concerns of status blind him to the abilities of his social inferiors. 
Rewards go to the able as to the well-birthed. There is no formal path to 
advancement. The ambitious await the notice of superiors or build their own 
power base until such notice is inevitable. 
<P>Nipponese society is structured to allow the greatest freedom to men. In 
Nippon, most women acquesce to this cultural pattern. Still, there are those who 
overcome these restrictions. Such women carve their own niches in society. In 
Nippon, they are respected for their skill and courage. 
<P>The women of the Tokugawa period were the most oppressed, but even then a 
prominent woman could do well. In earlier ages, women had a great deal of 
freedom to move about and influence their surroundings. The real power behind 
Minamoto Yoritomo was his wife Hojo Masako. It is no accident that the Hojo 
family became Regents over a weak Shogun almost immediately after Yoritomo's 
death. 
<H2>The Castes</H2>Nipponese society has a caste structure. Highest in prestige, 
although not in power, are the <I>kuge</I>, the imperial nobility. This group 
includes the immediate family and more distant relatives of the emperor; 
"retired" (officially abdicated but often still influential) emperors; and the 
ancient nobility of Nippon. The person of the emperor transcends any questions 
of caste for he is an embodiment of the divine kami and a descendant of 
Amaterasu (the sun-kami). 
<P>The emperor lacks direct political power but his approval is necessary for a 
samurai to take the title of shogun. His influence and blessing must be courted 
in Kyoto, where he presides at the center of an intellectual circle that sets 
the pattern of artistic expression, fashion and philosophy. 
<P>The emperor's influence is limited by the samurai practice of enthroning an 
imperial child in the place of an abdicated emperor. The shogun or some other 
very powerful samurai acts as regent until the child comes of age and is forced 
to abdicate in favor of yet another imperial child. The emperor spends his days 
in religious rituals and artistic pursuits, occasionally interacting with the 
real world to trade official approval of shogunate policies for some privilege 
or benefit. 
<P>Often, there are several retired emperors alive at one time. Though they lack 
the semi-divine status of the ruling emperor, their political influence is still 
strong in the court and can be a force to be reckoned with. Often these retired 
emperors, or members of their circle of nobles, get involved in plots to 
strengthen the imperial influence or rebuild a political/military power-base for 
the throne. 
<P>In the Heian period, the "retired" emperors were the actual government at 
times. Often a young emperor abdicated on his own to avoid the ritual and get 
down to the real business of governing. 
<P>Below the prines and princesses of the imperial family are the ranks of 
greater and lesser nobles, ministers, and bureaucrats of the imperial court. 
Since status in the kuge is dependent on the antiquity of the family line, 
newcomers are very rare. These immensely educated and sophisticated nobles are 
often poor in terms of material wealth; much poorer than their social inferiors, 
the ruling <I>buke</I>. Many are reduced to peddling their influence at court in 
return for the resources to maintain their lifestyles. This is not universally 
true. The kuge were very wealthy in Heian Japan, and even in later periods many 
still had significant wealth. Their main problem was control of land. The kuge 
held vast stretches of land during the Heian period, guarded by stewards while 
the kuge relaxed in the capitol. Eventually, the stewards stopped remitting 
taxes to the capitol and noble power declined. But even in the worst days many 
kuge still had some land remitting income. 
<P>The real rulers of Nippon are the buke, the caste of the samurai. This caste 
includes the samurai and jizamurai. In some senses, the ronin may be included as 
well. A petitioner for the title (and rank) of shogun must be born into a 
samurai clan. 
<P>The government of the samurai, called the <I>bakufu</I>, is headed by a 
shogun. The shogun is, for all practical purposes, the supreme ruler of the 
country. When the shogun and his clan are strong, his word is law, enforced by 
the clan armies. When the shogun and his clan are weak, various samurai lords 
rule freely in their own domains. The strongest prepare for the day when they 
may overthrow the shogun and petition the emperor to name the successful rebel 
(usually at this point encamped outside Kyoto with an army) as the new shogun. 
<P>Like all governments, the bakufu has a bureaucracy. Like many governments 
throughout history, as the central authority grows weaker, the bureaucracy grows 
more complex and corrupt. The ministers of the bakufu are appointed by the 
shogun, usually for life or until they incur his displeasure, which may very 
well be the same thing. Some ministers serve as the shogun's personal 
representative overseeing important sections of the country. Others serve in an 
advisory council, each responsible for a government office dealing with a 
specific area of concern such as the economy, agricultural planning, road 
maintenance, or military strength. Serving the deputies and ministers are 
various underlings ranging from administrators of whole provinces down to local 
police forces and tax officials. Even under a strong shogun, the further from 
the seat of government, the more likely officials are to exercise their 
authority for their own ends and comforts. Most shoguns maintain a network of 
spies, magistrates, and informers who operate outside the regular bureaucracy as 
a check against excesses and a guard against rebellion. 
<P>In many ways, the shogun and his clan are first among equals. The great 
landholding lords, the <I>daimyo</I>, have their own clans, advisory councils, 
military forces, and even buraucracies paralleling those of the bakufu. Whithin 
their lands, the daimyo are the law. Only the strongest of shoguns dare overrule 
them. To qualify for the status of daimyo, a clan leader had to be a samurai, 
have income from his land of at least 10,000 koku per year, and receive official 
sanction by the shogun or the emperor. New daimyo were created periodically, and 
old ones vanished, as their clans lost their power or were shattered. At any 
given time, there were usually between 200-300 daimyo in all of Nippon. 
<P>Samurai serve within their clans, owing fealty either directly to the clan 
lord (who may be a daimyo himself, or simply owe fealty to a daimyo= or to one 
of his subordinates. They are soldiers for the army and guards for palaces and 
castles, as well as middle managers and manpower for the hundred and one tasks 
involved in the day-to-day life of the clan. Income and status within the 
samurai caste vary widely. 
<P>Ranking below the "true" samurai are the <I>jizamurai</I>. They are 
landholders in their own right, much like European country squires and poor 
landed knights. Jizamurai are very possessive about their holdings, always 
fearing the rapacious desires of greater lords. At times they band together for 
mutual defense against attempts by nearby daimyo to seize the jizamurai 
holdings. On occasion such groupings become permanent and a new samurai clan is 
born. The jizamurai virtually disappeared during the Tokugawa period, when they 
were given the choice of being true samurai or becoming true peasants (losing 
their swords). Before that time, they were a force to be reckoned with. 
<P>In early times, the term <I>ronin</I> was used to refer to a peasant that had 
absconded from the land, usually to become an <I>ashigaru</I>. The more-used 
latter meaning refers to a samurai deprived of masters and/or land. Many 
jizamurai became ronin after 1600 A.D. 
<P>The <I>heimin</I> caste is the backbone of the Nipponese economy. It includes 
the farmers, artisans, and merchants. Within the caste the highest social rank 
is accorded to the poorest class, the farmers. They produce the rice upon which 
the nation lives. Next come the artisans, who produce tangible results from 
their labor. Lowest, and richest, are the merchants, who are seen as parasites 
who fatten on the work of others. 
<P>Oppressed heimin often form leagues called <I>ikki</I> to resist intolerable 
conditions. When peaceful overtures fail, such leagues may resort to armed 
rebellion. Such rebellions are almost always doomed, with great loss of life to 
its supporters and execution for its leaders. Yet even in such a defeat the 
heimin sometimes win their point, as the embarassed samurai lord accedes to 
their original requests once order is restored. 
<P>Some farmers are quite wealthy. During the Late Warring States period they 
prospered and became nearly independent of the ruling classes (who were involved 
in death struggles among themselves). Some ikke proved so strong that they 
controlled whole districts and provinces for years at a time. The oppression of 
the Tokugawa period was a Bakufu reaction to this free spirit. 
<P>Among the heimin dwell the <I>yakuza</I>: criminals, gamblers, bullies, and 
the occasional "Robin Hood." These men organize themselves into "clans" on the 
samurai model. The head of a gang is known as the <I>oyabun</I>, a title with 
all the connotations of a Mafia "godfather." The members are bound by a code of 
group loyalty and obedience to the oyabun, serving him as samurai would serve 
their lord. A yakuza failing his oyabun does not commit seppuku as a failed 
samurai might. Instead, he cuts off a joint from one of his fingers (usually the 
left hand little finger) as a symbolic suicide, and offers it to the oyabun. 
Acceptance preserves the yakuza's life. Rejection indicates that the oyabun 
feels the failure is deserving of death and a real suicide is expected. 
<P>Below the heimin are the <I>eta</I>, a caste of people whose livelihoods are 
considered unclean or unsuitable. Any occupations which deal with dead animals, 
such as butcher and tanner, as well as those which deal with the dead or the 
taking of life, such as undertaker, sexecutioner, or gravedigger, fall into the 
unclean category. Entertainers, travelling actors, and even the highly regarded 
courtesans of the "willow world" ply trades which are unsuitable for proper 
folk. The lives of eta are full of misery, with little hope of improvement 
unless they run away to a new part of the country and conceal their origins. 
Players and gamemasters should think carefully before saddling a player with the 
burdens of an eta character. 
<P>Outside the formal structure of society are several significant groups of 
people. Buddhist clerics have no official status, yet are usually regarded 
somewhat more highly than the heimin. Physicians and famous scholars fall into a 
similar social niche. The samurai show their regard for such individuals by 
granting them permission to war two swords and bear two names. Ronin (masterless 
smaurai) are casteless as well. Any respect shown to them is based more on fear 
than on admiration. Many consider them even worse than the bandits and criminals 
who creep around the edges of Nipponese society. 
<P>Perhaps the most feared of the casteless folk are the <I>ninja</I>, dwellers 
in the dark night. This fear causes many folk to be cautious and circumspect 
around someone demonstrating ninja skills or suspected of being a ninja. If the 
person is not really a ninja, any blatant accuser will be greatly shamed and 
dishonored. If the person is a ninja, the accuser may not have much longer to 
live, even if the accused is killed. Ninja have relatives who will avenge them 
and mysterious ways of learning the secrets of their enemies. 
<P>Neither being a ninja nor employing a ninja is a crime. Yet a ninja, or 
person openly associated with one is suspect and shunned by most of society. A 
ninja caught in a criminal or treasonous act is subject to immediate and 
shameful execution. Anyone hiring a ninja for a criminal act is as guilty as the 
actual perpetrator, if a connection can be proven. 
<H1>Living Conditions</H1>Nipponese houses are usually small, wooden-framed 
buildings with outer walls of plaster. They are built on short pilings that 
raise them from the ground to allow air circulation. Additional air spaces are 
present in the space between the ceiling and the roof. Many of the outer walls 
are movable, allowing the house to be opened to the elements. For inclement 
weather, windows and outer doors have sliding or hinged wooden covers called 
<I>amado</I>. In pleasant weather, doors and windows are opened during the day 
to air the house and discourage the mildew fostered by the humid climate. 
Heating is provided by movable charcoal burners called <I>hibachi</I>. 
<P>An entryway at the front of a house provides a covered area where shoes and 
outdoor gear are removed before entering the house proper. The outer half of 
this area is floored with packed earth. After removing his shoes a visitor steps 
up to the hardwood floor of the house. Just inside the house proper is a sword 
rack ready to receive the katana of guests. 
<P>The floors of the rooms are covered with rice-straw mats called 
<I>tatami</I>. These measure 3 feet by 6 feet and are two and a half inches 
thick. A room's size is measured in the number of mats needed to cover the floor 
(e.g. 4-mat, 6-mat, or 8-mat room) and are always of a geometry to allow the 
placement of full-sized mats. Rooms are separated by wooden walls or by sliding 
panels constructed of wooden lattices and paper panels. Heavy panels with opaque 
paper (<I>fusuma</I>) serve as room dividers while lighter panels fitted with 
translucent rice paper panels (<I>shoji</I>) function as doors and windows. 
Sometimes extra sliding tracks are provided to allow rearranging of the pattern 
of walls within a house. The floors of corridors between rooms are of polished 
hardwood. 
<P>The furnishings of a Nipponese house are sparse. A typical room has little 
more than a low table and some sitting cushions. Rooms serve double duty; at 
night any room may become a bedroom when mattresses (<I>futon</I>) and hardwood 
pillows are brought out from a chest of drawers or a closet. A room which is 
reserved for a particular occupant might have a dresser or cabinet for storage 
of personal items. Items of decoration or mementoes are often displayed on 
walls. The main room of a house invariably has a recessed alcove, slightly 
raised from floor level, called the <I>tokonoma</I>. It is designed for the 
display of artworks, flowers, or decorative scrolls. In a religious household, 
another alcove will house the family's shrines, the <I>kamidana</I> for Shinto 
and/or the <I>butsudan</I> for Buddhism. A shelf, above head height, often runs 
around the walls of the room and is used for storage. A warrior's household will 
usually have a lacquered armor chest wherein is stored the owner's martial 
equipage. The suit of armor itself might be on display in a corner or folded 
within the box. 
<P>The kitchen is usually located at the rear of the house and has an entrance 
to access the family's garden plot. The floor of the kitchen is of polished 
hardwood where it connects with the house and packed earth near the door to the 
outside. A storeroom oftens opens off this part of the room. 
<P>A partially or completely separate building houses the bathtub, toilet, and 
washing facilities. 
<H2>Typical Manorhouse</H2>The typical manorhouse residence of a samurai lord 
consists of several buildings and gardens surrounded by an eight-to-ten foot 
wall. The size and elegance of these features varies according to the wealth and 
social standing of the owner. Wealthier lords' homes boast more rooms of the 
types described above as well as special rooms reserved for specific functions. 
All of the rooms are most certainly larger and grander in their materials, 
furnishings, and decorations. 
<P>The major building has rooms of receptions or audiences, guest rooms, and the 
rooms regularly used by the family. Often the women are sequestered in a 
separate part of the house. Servants' quarters are located near the center next 
to cooking and maintenance facilities. A veranda usually extends around the 
building. 
<P>Retainers are housed in communal long-houses around the edges of the 
compound. Such houses are often incorporated into the outer compound wall. 
Priviledged or rich retainers might maintain their own separate residences. 
<P>Other buildings in the compound can include stables and appropriate workspace 
for the blacksmith, a teahouse, a bath house, a small shrine, storehouses, and 
possibly even a Noh stage. 
<P>The gate to the compound can give an indication of the owner's approximate 
rank and wealth. Government regulations set forth the styles and decoration 
types suitable for a samurai's rank. There may also be lesser gates, but these 
are rarely ostentatious. All gates are guarded by the lord's samurai, even after 
they are closed at dark. 
<H2>Typical Castle</H2>Early castles in Nippon are built simply as military 
strongholds to provide strategic defense points. Most are built on hills or in 
the mountains. Later castles are built to be residences as well as forts, many 
of them on small knolls or even on flat ground. In all cases, Nipponese 
engineers work to maximize the terrain advantages provided by the castle's site. 

<P>Outer defenses consist of moats (dry as well as wet) and high wooden or stone 
walls on the interior side. Walls and moats are arranged in "rings," with 
additional passages and open areas to give a maze-like effect. Gates in 
successive rings are always off-set to further confuse and delay attackers. 
Ramparts support wood and plaster walls to protect the defenders. These walls 
have holes to allow the defenders to use their bows. Sometimes the walls are 
double-sided and roffed to provide additional protection and to allow continuous 
harassment of attackers even after a wall's gate has been breached. The main 
keep is often supported by lesser keeps which are incorporated into the overall 
structure of the castle. 
<P>In the center of the castle stands a great keep, a multi-storied structure. 
It stands on a high, slope-walled stone foundation in which corridors and rooms 
are sometimes hollowed for storage, treasuries, armories, and escape passages. 
The upper levels are of wood and plaster construction. Like all plaster used in 
Nipponese castle construction, this outer surface is treated to be 
fire-resistant, resulting in a brilliant white finish. The first level of the 
upper keep is provided with chutes and trapdoors to allow defenders to rain down 
rocks and other debris to impede attackers. The upper levels are progressibely 
less fortified since they are usually out of reach of enemy archers. They are 
used as living quarters. 
<P>In Nippon, magical defenses are incorporated into most castles. Due to the 
great size of Nipponese castles, lords can sometimes only provide such 
protection for parts of the castle. Most common are spells to foil the magical 
assaults of attackers; other spells might provide warnings of armed intruders. 
<P>A castle's true strength is the samurai who defend it. 
<H1>Clothing</H1>A samurai normally wears a wide-sleeved, robe-like garment 
(<I>kimono</I>) and a divided skirt (<I>hakama</I>). A sash (<I>obi</I>) is worn 
around the waist, and into it are tucked the samurai's swords. The hakama may be 
worn loose or gathered together below the knee and tied closely around the lower 
leg. Split-toed socks (<I>tabi</I>) are worn along with straw sandals 
(<I>wariji</I>). Formal occasions call for the addition of a vest-like garment 
called <I>kamishimo</I> which bears the heraldic symbol (<I>mon</I>) of the 
samurai's allegiance. 
<P>A lady does not wear the hakama or kamishimo. Instead her kimono is of 
floor-length or longer. She often wears a second kimono, of complementary 
colors, to give a layered effect. Her sash is very wide and usually tied in an 
elaborate bow. Formal wear calls for more expensive versions of everyday styles 
and further layers. Women adventurers often wear male garb. 
<P>Everyday wear is likely to be made of cotton and sometimes linen but formal 
versions are of imported Chinese silk. Both materials are often printed in 
decorative patterns or repetitive designs. The kimono may be any color but 
warriors favor subdued hues. The hakama likewise varies in color but is usually 
darker than the kimono. Black and other very dark colors are favored. A 
samurai's obi is almost invariably white. Ladies usually sport pastel shades and 
bright colors. A lady's obi is often as colorful as the rest of her outfit. In 
Nippon, white is the color of death as well as purity. It is worn for formal 
seppuku. Samurai expecting to die in battle often lace their armor with white 
cords. 
<HR>
<I>For clothing, anything between cotton and natural silk will do. A man who 
squanders money for clothing and brings his household finances into disorder is 
fit for punishment. Generally, one should furnish himself with armor that is 
appropriate to his social position, sustain his retainers, and use his money for 
martial affairs. <BR>
<CENTER>(The Precepts of Kato Kiyomasa)</CENTER></I>
<HR>
Bat wather gear consists of a straw raincoat, which makes a person resemble an 
ambulatory haystack, and high-soled wooden clogs instead of regular sandals. The 
clogs prevent wetting the feet in puddles but can require a delicate balancing 
act to keep one's feet. Oiled paper umbrellas are used as well. 
<P>Buttons are not used at all. Clothing is tied to secure it in place. 
<P>The Nipponese wear little jewelry. Elaborate combs and pins for a lady's hair 
are almost the only types to see regular wear. Rings are unknown and other 
jewelry (earrings, necklaces, medallions, etc.) is rare. Adornment may be 
carried or worn in the form of fans, parasols, elaborate sword furniture, small 
lacquered or enameled boxes for sundries, and toggles (<I>netsuke</I>) which 
keep pouches from sliding through the sash. 
<P>Male samurai shave the upper, front portion of their heads which makes them 
look as if they are balding. The rest of the hair is left long but tied into a 
queue at the back of the head. This is worn sticking up in the "tea whisk" style 
or folded forward then back again over itself in the more popular style. Boys 
and young men leave a forelock, which is split and dressed towards either 
temple. The forelock is shaved at the boy's coming-of-age ceremony. Ladies wear 
their hair long in a single ponytail commonly gathered at the nape of the neck, 
but occasionally as low as the small of the back. For dress-up occations, 
elaborate coiffures of multiple loops are socially required. 
<H1>Customs</H1>The Nipponese adhere strongly to several customs which are alien 
to Westerners. 
<H2>Ronin</H2><I>Ronin</I>, or "wave men," are so named because they wander the 
land of Nippon aimlessly, back and forth like the waves of the sea. They are 
samurai who no longer have a master. A samurai can find himself in this 
situation due to discharge of service for real or imagined crimes, the 
reassignment of his territory to a rival, the destruction of his clan, or his 
lord's death. Becoming ronin is not irreversible; a ronin might find another 
lord and become samurai again. Rather than face the loss of honor in becoming 
ronin upon the death of a lord, some samurai elect seppuku. 
<P>Ronin are outside the normal society structure, yet they keep their attitudes 
of samurai superiority. In group-conscious Nippon, they are perennial outsiders. 
They are distrusted for this and feared as well. Their martial skills make them 
dangerous to any who cross them, especially since they are without the direction 
of a lord and outside the normal constraints on behavior. 
<P>Many ronin are desperate men, destute of material wealth or spiritual solace. 
Some attempt to earn an honest living by teaching their martial skills or hiring 
themselves out as bodyguards. Others merely bully their way through life or turn 
to outright brigandage. 
<P>The most famous story about ronin is the <I>Chushingura</I>, the tale of the 
forty-seven ronin. The forty-seven were retainers of a lord who was maneuvered 
by a rival into committing seppuku. For a year, the retainers lived as ronin 
while awaiting their chance to attack the mansion of the rival lord. Their 
attack was successful and they presented the head of the rival to their lord's 
grave. The shogunate ordered them to commit seppuku. This they did, having 
fulfilled their duty to their lord. They have been honored since as true 
samurai. 
<H2>Katakiuchi</H2>There are strict rules for conducting a <I>katakiuchi</I>, a 
legal vendetta, in Nippon. The vendetta may only be directed against the person 
who has killed or caused the death of a person close to the avenger. The right 
or wrong of the original death is immaterial once the katakiuchi permit is 
issued. The avenger must be of equal or lower social status than the person whom 
he wishes to revenge. Thus, a lord may not revenge a vassal, an older brother 
may not avenge a younger, and a father may not revenge a son. Once the 
katakiuchi is registered, the avenger may not return home without proof of his 
success. The avenger must ask for a leave of absence from his lord to register 
and complete his katakiuchi. 
<P>The permit for katakiuchi is issued by the lord of the province in which the 
target resides. If he refuses, no vendetta may take place in that province and 
the target is safe as long as he stays in that province. When permission for 
katakiuchi is granted, all pertinent data is enterd into a document which the 
avenger must carry with him to present to officials once the vendetta is 
completed. The killing must be deliberate, not accidental, on the part of the 
avenger or the katakiuchi is uncompleted. The deliberate killing of the target 
by a third party renders the katakiuchi uncompletable. An unregistered or 
improperly registered katakiuchi killing leaves the avenger subject to a charge 
of murder, although sympathetic samurai officials often drop the charges. 
<P>Governmental regulations and clan custom provide motivation for katakiuchi. A 
son often may not be allowed to inherit while his father's slayer still lives. 
Similarly, a younger brother may have to avenge an older in order to receive his 
portion of a fief. In many clans, the person to be revenged is considered to 
have lost honor for having been so unprepared or unskilled as to be slain. This 
lost honor reflects on those eligible to avenge him. Katakiuchi would restore 
his honor. 
<P>Samurai who have successfully completed a katakiuchi are often rewarded by 
their lords with gifts or increased stipends. They may be offered better 
positions with other lords. Successful avengers have demonstrated samurai 
virtues and skills. 
<P>Other, more extensive, blood feuds (<I>fukushu</I>) exist in clan-oriented 
Nippon. A group may elect to register a vendetta against the slayer or slayers 
of a member of their group or for an insult. The target(s) must be notified of 
the fukushu andof the names of all those listed as targets. Otherwise the rules 
of katakiuchi apply. Officials often limit the number of avengers who may 
attempt fukushu, or apply other restrictions to minimize what could easily 
become a slaughter. 
<P>The rigid rules described above are from the Tokugawa period. Earlier periods 
were more relaxed, and frequently the perpetrator of a vendetta sought nobody's 
permission. 
<H2>Kirisutegomen</H2><I>Kirisutegomen</I> is the custom of "killing and going 
away." It refers to the samurai's right to kill a member of the heimin or eta 
castes who has acted other than as "expected." Surliness, discourtesy, and 
inappropriate behavior are not "expected" of the lower castes. Samurai may be 
held by officials, pending investigation of whether the victim was indeed 
deserving of the samurai's action. 
<P>In Nippon, anyone may defend himself from attack. A lower caste member 
successfully defending himself from a samurai will be questioned but is usually 
released since the samurai, having lost, certainly did not embody samurai 
virtues. Most lords will not grant katakiuchi rights against such a lower caste 
person. 
<P>Kirisutegomen, like formal katakiuchi, is a product of the Tokugawa period. 
Though samurai could (and often did) kill commoners for minor reasons in earlier 
times, kirisutegomen wasn't quite so common when commoners had swords, too. In 
1590, Hideyoshi conducted a sword hunt to deprive all heimin, priests, etc. of 
their weapons. This paved the way for the stricter class distinctions which 
rapidly followed. 
<H2>Sword Etiquette and Customs</H2>The sword, particularly the katana, is 
believed to be the "soul" of a samurai. Fine blades are often handed down for 
generations within clans and families, with each successive wielder adding to 
the sword's glamor. Samurai often ask for well-known blades of defeated enemies 
after a battle, as their reward for service to their victorious lord. Since a 
samurai's honor is bound to his sword, if he loses it he is in a sorry state. 
Unless he recovers it, his honor is lost as well. 
<P>Normally only the buke wear the two swords (dai-sho). The kuge have the right 
but usually disdain such a vulgar display of martial attitude. Physicians also 
have the right, but often cannot afford them and so do without or wear wooden 
mock-ups. Heimin (other than ashigaru soldiers in service to a lord) are 
sometimes permitted to carry a single sword, usually a wakizashi, when 
travelling. Such a traveler is required to carry a document stating this 
permission, his starting point and his destination. Before the Tokugawa period, 
in areas where control was loose, heimin carried swords quite frequently. A good 
rule of thumb for heimin sword-bearing is the power of the central government 
and local daimyos (i.e., are they strong enough to suppress the peasants in 
their district?) 
<P>Even police are usually not sword-armed. In the Tokugawa period, only 
precinct heads of police were samurai. All others were heimin and not all of 
them were permitted swords. All carried jittes, which announced their office and 
doubled as a nice sword-breaker. Earlier police were similar. The Heian-era 
police were led by nobles, but the actual work was still done by heimin, because 
of the noble's distaste for such unruly work. To the nobleman, the position was 
just a sinecure. 
<P>Swords are worn stuck through the obi (waist sash). The scabbarded blade is 
normally worn with the edge towards the ground, signifying peaceful or at least 
non-hostile intent. Worn edge-up, the sword is in position for an iaijutsu draw 
and is inherently more hostile. Turning the blade from a normal position to 
edge-up is often considered an aggressive gesture. 
<P>The katana (and other weapons such as spears, bows, etc.) is removed upon 
entering a house. Often a servant, handling the sword with a cloth so that he 
will not soil it, receives the scabbarded blade and places it in a sword rack. A 
samurai will retain his short sword, carried in his right hand or placed at his 
right side where it cannot be brought into play quickly. When entering a 
building belonging to a lord other than his own, a samurai would expect to have 
all weapons removed, to be returned when he leaves. 
<P>Swords receive great respect. In showing off a famous blade, the owner 
presents it to the viewer with the edge towards himself. The viewer should draw 
it no more than an inch or two from the scabbard unless the owner urges him to 
draw it further. Only with additional urgings should it be removed completely 
from the scabbard and then only with the edge of the blade away from all 
present. 
<H2>Seppuku</H2><I>Seppuku</I>, also known as <I>harakiri</I>, is a form of 
ritual suicide used by the samurai. It can be meted out by a lord as punishment 
or chosen by an individual for a number of reasons. A samurai must request 
permission from his feudal superior in order to commit seppuku. 
<P>Samurai convicted of significant crimes are usually ordered to commit 
seppuku. This is a privilege of their caste, allowing them to commit suicide 
rather than face shameful execution. For particularly heinous crimes (such as 
arson or treason to the emperor), a samurai might be forbidden seppuku and 
executed as a commoner. 
<P>Seppuku is not the proper solution to every dilemma faced by a samurai, 
especially if it leaves some harm unavenged or is an attempt to avoid an 
unpleasant task. It is a coward's act to commit seppuku to avoid a duel or 
vendetta. 
<HR>
<I>One should not torture himself over a single mistake. What is essential is 
one's presence of mind hereafter. In the Lun Yu it says, "When one makes a 
mistake, he should not be hesitant to correct it." It says further, "Making a 
mistake and not correcting it, this is a real mistake." <BR>
<CENTER>(Opinions in Ninety-Nine Articles by Takeda Nobushige)</CENTER></I>
<HR>
An insoluble conflict (such as being obligated to perform a deed which would 
bring intolerable shame, while not performing it would be dishonorable) and 
avoidance of a dishonorable task set by a feudal superior are reasonable grounds 
for seppuku. Seppuku is an accepted solution to preserve endangered honor. The 
most common case is to avoid capture or a dishonorable death at the hands of 
foes in battle. Battlefield seppuku was often carried out with little ceremony. 
<P>Seppuku is normally considered to restore lost personal honor when performed 
as atonement for the actions or inactions which brought about the dishonor. 
<P><I>Kanshi</I> is a type of seppuku intended to reprove one's lord. A loyal 
samurai win the good of his clan at heart might choose this act to open his 
lord's eyes to wicked, foolish, or dishonorable acts. The perfect devotion to 
the lord's best interests shown by such a samurai is held in high esteem. A 
samurai need not receive his lord's permission to commit kanshi. 
<P><I>Funshi</I> is a type of seppuku designed to display hatred of a foe whom a 
samurai is unable to harm. The samurai makes a public declaration of the wrongs 
committed by the foe, in the hope that the public shame will serve the samurai's 
need for revenge. Officials rarely deny requests for vendetta to survivors of a 
samurai who has committed funshi. 
<P>Another type of seppuku is <I>junshi</I>. When a great leader died, many 
loyal retainers would commit suicide rather than outlive their beloved leader. 
This practice was often involuntary during legendary history. The Tokugawa 
Shogunate outlawed junshi as a waste of human resources, and enforced this by 
executing the wife and children of junshi-offenders. This practice has popped up 
in modern Japanese history as well. When the Emperor Meiji died in 1912, General 
Nogi of Russo-Japanese War fame committed suicide along with his wife to follow 
the emperor. 
<P>The formal ceremony usually takes place in a quiet spot surrounded by the 
beauties of nature. All participants and observers wear formal clothes. The 
principal, dressed in white, kneels with chosen second standing slightly behind 
him and to his left. After composing himself, the principal slits his stomach 
with a short sword or dagger. The full ceremony consists of three cuts, across 
from left to right, up, then diagonally into the heart. The second, to prevent 
any unseemly display of pain by the principal, strikes with his katana, cutting 
off the principal's head. 
<P>A female samurai performs a variation known as <I>jigai</I>. Before 
commencing the act, she ties her ankles together to maintain a modest posture in 
death. Instead of slitting her belly, she cuts her own throat with a dagger. 
<P>In extreme cases any form of suicide, when approached with a proper samurai 
attitude and full intent beforehand, could be considered seppuku. 
<H2>Dueling</H2>Duels are common in Nippon. They may be fought to settle an 
argument, redress an insult (real or imagined), gain honor and renown, or prove 
the superiority of a favored martial approach. As long as witnesses are present 
to state that a duel was entered into freely by both parties, the duel is legal. 

<P>Duels may be fought on the spot or set for an arranged time and place. They 
are often arranged for a time and place where the combatants will be 
undisturbed. The European method of using seconds as go-betweens and stand-ins 
is not followed, although supporters of the duelists may be present for moral 
support or to insure a fair fight. 
<P>Duels may be fought with real weapons or wooden practice weapons. In either 
case, the fight may continue until first blood, until one party conceeds the 
superiority of the other, or until death according to the wills of the 
combatants. 
<P>Some clans forbid dueling among their members to avoid useless bloodshed that 
could weaken the clan. Enmity and jealousy sometimes still ends in a duel, 
although most such rivalries result in political infighting instead. 
<H2>Boasting</H2>Samurai are proud of their lineage and their deeds. At the 
start of a battle or combat, a samurai will often announce his name and clan as 
well as a short list of great deeds he or his ancestors have done. His opponent 
is likely to do the same. This encourages the first to add more great deeds to 
his announcement, preferably at the expense of the opponent's clan. Consider 
this challenge from a battle in the Hogen war. 
<HR>
<I>"I once captured Ono Shichiro the chief of the brigands on Mount Suzuka in 
Ise province, and have thus received the emperor's commands to become 
vice-commander in chief of his army. My name is Kagetsuna. Watch my arrow and 
see whether or not it strikes you!"

Boasting serves as an identification of the samurai who will, he hopes, do 
something noteworthy in the combat. It bolsters his own courage and may unnerve 
the opponent who is about to fight such a fierce and accomplished scion of a 
renowned and feared warrior lineage. 
<H2>Recreation</H2>Competitions of all sorts are popular among the samurai. 
These usually take the form of displays of prowess, in either the martial or the 
gentler arts. Contests in archery, poetry, and horsemanship are among the most 
popular. 
<P>Some popular sports began as religious rituals. <I>Sumo</I> developed from 
part of a fertility ritual into a betting sport replete with popular champions. 
Accuracy contests for mounted archers developed from an ancient Shinto form of 
divination through study of the horses' footprints. 
<P>Two-player strategy games such as <I>go</I> and <I>shogi</I> are popular. Go 
occupies a social niche similar to that of chess in medieval Europe. Some card 
games are played, as well as various dice games. Almost all forms of games 
involve betting on the outcome or make betting integral to their play. Gambling 
halls are common in the cities and even inns may have a regular gambling room. 
Gambling is often run by professionals under the control of the yakuza. 
<P>Dancing and singing are popular at festivals and holiday celebrations. 
Itinerant actors and puppeteers travel freely through Nippon staging shows. 
Large cities have theaters where plays are regularly performed. 
<P>Cities have pleasure districts where all sorts of entertainments can be 
found. Most notable among them are the elegant geisha houses where a man may 
find a full evening's worth of dining, drinking, entertainment, and other sorts 
of amusement. 
<P>Moon viewing is a pasttime learned by the samurai from the kuge. Participants 
spend an evening dining and drinking in a refined atmosphere. They then retire 
outside to observe the moon. Those of poetic bent are expected to compose 
extempore verse for the occasion. 
<P>Another placid pasttime is the <I>cha-no-yu</I>, or tea ceremony. This is an 
elaborate and strictly defined ritual for the making and drinking of tea. Many 
samurai mansions have special, small buildings in their gardens reserved for 
such ceremonies. 
<H2>Liquor</H2>Rice beer, mildly alcoholic, is common throughout Nippon, 
especially among the lower classes. 
<P><I>Sake</I>, a rice wine, is more popular with the buke and others who can 
afford it. It is properly drunk from small cups after it has been heated to body 
temperature. 
<P><I>Shochu</I> is a strong beverage distilled from sake dregs. It is commonly 
available only in specialized drinking establishments and is only popular with 
serious drinkers. 
<P>Various fruit brandies are also available. 
<H2>Retirement</H2>It is common for a member of the kuge or buke castes to 
retire from daily life in his later years, to shave his head and become a monk. 
The person takes the vows of a priest of his chosen religion, usually Buddhist. 
His behavior is subject to the strictures of Buddhism. Rather than actually 
taking on the religious activity of a normal priest, the retired person devotes 
time to meditation or the arts. Becoming a monk in this fashion is a statement 
that the person is preparing for his death rather than embarking on a new course 
of life. Such a course is an admirableone for a samurai who has lived a full, 
adventurous life. 
<P>Some samurai (particularly devious, politically oriented lords) profess to 
retire and become "monks", yet remain active in the world. Such characters may 
become initiates or priests of their religion and still lead an active political 
and military life. The realties of such a life will often leave such a character 
in sin or a state of pollution so that he will have no access to divine magic. 
In this he resembles the sohei of some Buddhist sects; but unlike the sohei, he 
follows his own will and does not have the sanction of religious superiors for 
actions not in accord with standard religious doctrines. Such actions may in 
fact incur the displeasure of those same religious overlords, leaving the "monk" 
cut off from the gods - although his military and political powers may more than 
make up for the lack. 
<P>A character may, at some point in his life, desire to take a more religious 
path for reasons other than retirement. Such a freely chosen course may be taken 
as long as the character can meet the requirements to become an initiate or 
priest of the chosen religion. He receives the benefits of, and must observe the 
rules of, his religion. 
<P>Some samurai offer or are ordered to "shave their heads" as a punishment 
rather than commit seppuku. Such monks usually choose reclusive sects and strive 
to forget their former lives. A player character forced to this course has 
effectively left the campaign. 
<P>Characters forced to a religious course by an encounter with a deity may be 
considered to have received it either as a final punishment or merely a 
redirection of the character's life, depending on the circumstances and the 
character's actions to that point. In the former case the character leave sthe 
game as if he had been ordered to shave his head. In the latter, the player must 
strive to have his character meet the requirements of priesthood and devote his 
efforts to the religion of the deity encountered. A player not wishing to have a 
priest for a character may opt to have the character join a reclusive sect and 
begin a new character.
