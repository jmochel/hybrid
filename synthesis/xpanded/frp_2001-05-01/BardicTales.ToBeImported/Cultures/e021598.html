    </em> <h4 align="center">by <a href="staff.htm#cGMK">Geordie Keefe</a></h4>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>The samurai has long been a subject of fascination to westerners, but has been at least
    as misunderstood as the pop-culture spawning ninja. Samurai were never mindless automatons
    or honor-crazed warriors. Their environment shaped the behavior that seems so foreign to
    many, but did not destroy the individuality within. The legendary devotion to honor and
    disdain of life of the samurai were only reactions (often distorted by popular legend) to
    the dangerous lives they led. What truly motivated the samurai can not be learned from
    those reactions alone, but from a multitude of ambitions and feelings, some of which I
    hope to unveil.</p>
    <p>Herein I hope to show the actual motivations and emotions of the samurai. With samurai
    history largely affected by legend and romantic exaggeration, some of my interpretations
    may be more outrageous or conservative than those that would be made by a professional
    scholar on the matter. I hope for the reader's patience and appreciation of the difficulty
    of the subject.</p>
    <p>I do not intend to expound any tremendous revelation on the nature of the samurai in
    this essay. Only to exorcise any opinions about the samurai which I hold to be common
    misconceptions. Samurai (from the Japanese <i>saburo</i> - to serve) being a fairly vague
    term, for these purposes I will mainly use it in reference to any member of Japan's elite
    warrior class, predominantly from around the tenth to seventeenth century.</p>
    <h3>A Brief History</h3>
    <p>To lay a foundation for the samurai culture requires some knowledge of their background
    and environment. Though impossible to go into depth on such a subject here, I will breifly
    cover Japanese history in the time of the samurai, touching on some of the more
    significant events for this essay.</p>
    <p>Professional warriors have existed in Japan almost as long as people have existed
    there; practically necessitated by the inhospitable nature of Japan. Supplementing this,
    peasant conscription (taken from the Chinese practice) was quite common by the third
    century. At the end of the eighth century, such conscription was halted in favor of a
    permanent professional military, taken from the sons and brothers of district magistrates,
    and called <i>kondei</i>. Large military forces were mostly unnecessary, as Japan had
    little contact with hostile neighbors (excepting the Emishi and the Mongols, discussed
    below), and large armies were prone to poor discipline and suffering from (as well as
    causing) famine. The <i>kondei</i> showed many signs of being the progenitors of the
    samurai, being an elite fighting group, mostly specialized in mounted archery. Contact
    with the Emishi brought them even closer to the familiar model of the samurai.</p>
    <p>Througout the eighth century the Imperial Court conducted a campaign to conquer the
    'barbarians' of northern Japan, called Emishi. Though their customs were different, there
    are some reasons to believe the Emishi were physically similar (if not identical) to the
    Japanese. Success in this unprovoked invasion rose and fell; the Japanese had greater
    numbers, but the excellent archery and guerrilla warfare of the Emishi evened the odss.
    Their techniques were so effective that the Japanese adopted the one-edged sword and light
    armor of the Emishi, and possibly some archery techniques. This era also saw the origin of
    Japan's highest military rank, the <i>Sei-i-tai shogun</i> ('Great Barbarian-Subduing
    Generalissimo'), bound to play a pivitol role later in Japan's history. Development of the
    crossbow turned the tide against the Emishi, who generally conceded integration into
    Japan.</p>
    <p>From the Kanto area where the campaign against the Emishi had taken place came many of
    Japan's most influencial warriors. Minamoto Yoshitomo came from here, and used the Kanto
    area as a power base in his conflict against the Imperial court's most influential
    followers, the Taira. Where Yoshitomo failed, his son Toritomo succeeded. After defeating
    the Taira in 1185, Yoritomo took the reigns of power from the court, and later had them
    pronounce him <i>Sei-i-tai shogun</i>. Increases in productivity (and subsequently an
    excess of goods) in recent centuries had laid the foundation for the samurai, and Yoritomo
    cemented it. Samurai became a wealthy landowning class, answerable to a chain of superiors
    that led to Yoritomo's Kamakura shogunate, not the Emperor.</p>
    <p>In 1274 Japan faced its first major outside threat, an invading fleet from the Mongol
    empire. Though skilled fighters, the Japanese samurai were accustomed to an almost
    ritualistic form of battle; pronouncing their lineage and accomplishments to the enemy, in
    hope of drawing out a worthy opponent for single combat. The well-organized Mongol
    invaders took the advantage, but stubborn resistance and sea storms forced their
    withdrawal. Seven years later they returned with an even greater force, and though better
    prepared this time there was little the Japanese forces could do to stop them. By sheer
    luck (attributed to divine intervention), storms rose that devastated the Mongol fleet. To
    defend Japan against future incursions, military strength was increased and the samurai
    gained rights to raise troops and provisions from temple and aristocratic estates. Samurai
    on the whole reached a new pinnacle of power, but not so the shogunate. Since the
    defending samurai gained little loot and no land from the invading Mongols, they looked to
    the shogunate to compensate them. Attempts to do so weakened the Kamakura shogunate, and
    failures to do so drained support from it, until finally it was overthrown by the Ashikaga
    family.</p>
    <p>Though the Ashikaga were not as powerful as the Minamoto, Japan did enjoy almost a
    century of relative peace under them. This ended with the Onin war, lasting from
    1467-1477, when central power in Japan was effectively destroyed. Following this was a
    century of mayhem and warfare, as regional samurai rose as <i>Daimyo</i> ('big names',
    comparable to feudal lords), and seized all they could. Though samurai remained the ruling
    class, this time also saw a return of conscription, and with it the large, unruly armies
    of Japan's earlier days.</p>
    <p>Bloody though it may have been, this time produced some of the finest warriors and
    military minds in Japanese history. In particular Oda Nobunaga, who unified Japan again;
    his successor Hideyoshi; and finally Tokugawa Ieyasu. Though all were excellent military
    leaders, only Ieyasu managed to establish a dynasty and have himself proclaimed shogun.
    Under the Tokugawa shogunate followed a two and a half century reign of peace. Samurai
    turned from warcraft to bureacracy, retaining only the image of their former ways. When
    the Meiji restoration came in 1868, most samurai were prepared to abandon even that,
    ending their long rule over Japan.</p>
    <h3>Misconceptions</h3>
    <p>Two of the main misconceptions about samurai are their fanatical loyalty and their
    total lack of fear of death. Both have basis in fact, but can be refuted. For starters,
    fanatical loyalty was largely based on self-interest.</p>
    <p>What was probably the greatest influencer of samurai was a cross between reputation and
    honor; often referred to as <i>na</i> (name). More than just integrity, it was the
    foundation for the life of a samurai. Without a dignified reputation, a samurai was
    nothing. Loyal adherance to a single lord was often motivated by such a self-interest.
    Improving one's reputation would improve one's standing, lands, and other benefits;
    cowardice or disloyalty could have them taken away, and a samurai uprooted for such
    reasons would often die in misery and poverty. Betrayal, however, could set one higher
    than before in a rival camp; a tarnish to honor, perhaps, but an improvement in status.
    Some scholars have suggested that a sense of duty was completely secondary to honor and
    reputation. When Saeki Tsunenori charged to his death supporting Minamoto Yoriyoshi, he
    was followed by several of his vassals. Faced with being condemned for cowardice, they
    chose to protect their honor and reputation, even to the death.</p>
    <p>Charging boldly into death is another common attribute of the romantic samurai. Though
    such cases appear to have been over-exaggerated, and retreat and surrender
    under-exaggerated, the samurai definitely did hold a fearless attitude toward death. On
    the other hand, often when they held such an attitude it was because the alternative was
    death anyway, in addition to a loss to one's <i>na</i>. No discussion of the samurai and
    death can be complete without a reference to <i>seppuku</i> (ritual suicide); a sure sign
    of the fearlessness of the samurai, but still adhering to the reasoning I've mentioned.
    Two predominant reasons for committing <i>seppuku</i> were to avoid capture and to atone
    for criminal acts. Since capture generally meant death, preceded by torture and
    humiliation, suicide was considered a far better alternative. This was not unique to
    Japan; it was also a fairly common alternative in ancient Rome and other places.
    Similarly, certain crimes held a death sentence, but a samurai could choose to take his
    own life, avoiding damage to the family reputation and the humiliation of a public
    hanging. Though initially an excrutiatingly painful act, as <i>seppuku</i> grew 'in
    vogue', it became sufficient for the samurai only to show that he was resolved to die. As
    soon as he had picked up his sword or touched it to his belly, his <i>kaishakunin</i>
    (second) would cut his head off. At one point, even the sword was abandoned; the samurai
    would take a symbolic item (often a fan) to show his resolve, whereupon his second would
    commit the actual dirty work.</p>
    <p>One flaw in my argument is in the act of committing <i>seppuku</i> to follow a lord or
    master into death. Though understandable in defeat, this act became exceedingly common in
    the peaceful years of the Kamakura shogunate. Perhaps it was a sign that the samurai honor
    was not as selfish as some scholars propose. Still, after a while it became so common that
    it was damaging to the reputation <i>not</i> to do so. Undeterred at first by the
    disapproval of the shogun, this practice was finally put to an end when the shogunate made
    good on its threats to severly punish the heirs of all involved.</p>
    <p>Bravery in the face of death may also have led some to wrongly perceive that the
    samurai gave no value to life. An often exaggerated fact is that samurai had the ability
    to kill any commoner they wished for the slightest offense. This may have been true, but
    actual cases of doing so are infrequent. Samurai could not afford to hurt their name with
    a reputation for killing needlessly. Buddhist values and dependence on the common people
    also made such acts unnacceptable, though the predominant reason may have been the
    simplest: commoners did not often give the samurai reason to take offense.</p>
    <h3>Ideals</h3>
    <p>Any condemnation I make of the samurai should not be taken as a sign of any moral
    bankruptcy on their part. On the contrary, lapses in their morals are quite
    understandable, as the samurai operated under a heavy load of ideals. The samurai were
    encouraged to follow Buddhism, despite their bloody business and the threats of hell that
    followed from it. They were expected to show total devotion to tehri lord and to their
    parents, with the occasional risk that they would be forced to choose one side over the
    other. It wasn't for nothing that people compared duty to a mountain!</p>
    <p>The main ideals of the samurai can best be found (in my opinion) in Yamamoto
    Tsunetomo's <i><a
    href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=4770011067/theeclecticseizuA/">Hagakure</a></i>.
    It is an inspiring, straight-forward book, that returns often to the ideal Yamamoto cites;
    &quot;The way of the samurai is death&quot;. However, the book should be taken with a
    grain of salt, as its writer was never actually in combat. Yamamoto (like so many others)
    greatly romanticizes the selfless loyalty and honor of the samurai. Undoubtably, so many
    do so because writing otherwise would make for an unappealing book. Still, whether selfish
    or not, one of the great ideals of the samurai has always been to face death without fear.
    To do otherwise would be a great disgrace to his reputation.</p>
    <p>The value of that reputation for a samurai can not be overemphasized. It was by ones
    reputation that one achieved rank and the land attached to it, and by land that one
    supported the vassals that were the foundation of power. For the most part, samurai were
    judged by birth, ability, and reputation; after the Onin wars, birth became less
    important, allowing Hideyori and others to rise out of nothing to the top. Ambition to
    improve one's reputation was possibly the greatest driving factor in the samurai's
    history. That ambition was another burden to the samurai, for while pride was acceptable,
    ambition was stifled (quite naturally) from above. The value of this reputation was so
    important that many show surprise at the rapid collapse of the samurai during the Meiji
    restoration. At this point, reputation was waning in value, but the ambition that drove it
    was still there. They felt that well educated and aggressive samurai could feed their
    ambitions better if free to pursue the profit-making formerly denied to them. Some were
    proved wrong, but others were right.</p>
    <p>In behavior, the samurai were expected to behave much like the classic knights of King
    Arthur: respectful, dignified, compassionate, gallant, truthful, etc. The reality was
    often otherwise, as shown in the acts of Miyamoto Musashi. Often rude and arrogant,
    Musashi was noted for not even having the grace to bathe regularly. This, however, may
    have been a response to his having been ambushed twice in a bath; once being captured, the
    second time fighting his way out. Musashi exemplified the difference between an ideal
    samurai and a successful one; he kept himself alive.</p>
    <h3>The True Face</h3>
    <p>In many noble acts, the samurai acted in self-interest, but this does not mean that
    everything they did was selfish. While many samurai of his age were turning to bureacracy,
    Musashi followed a life dedicated to sword-fighting. This is not flawlessly noble,
    however; sword-training was still a lucrative trade at the time, and it should be
    remembered that Musashi was notoriously eccentric. Nobility was often shown in filial
    devotion as well, though this too was often distorted to selfish ends. Families would
    sometimes take both sides of a war, father on one side, oldest son on the other, to ensure
    success for the family (and hopefully a pardon for the loser). However, many instances of
    sacrifice and devotion appear to have been from honest love. The samurai were much like
    the people of other lands and times; some were selfish, some were not.</p>
