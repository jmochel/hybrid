<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Shogun,</b></font><font
size="4" face="Arial"> </font><font size="2" face="Arial">in
full, <i>seii tai shogun</i> (Jap., barbarian-subduing
generalissimo), title of the military dictators who ruled Japan
almost continuously from 1192 to 1867. The term was first used in
the Nara period (710-794), for generals sent against restless
tribes in the north-east. It then lapsed until Minamoto Yoshinaka
claimed it when he seized the capital Kyoto and cowed the
imperial court in 1183. After his death, the emperor awarded the
title in 1192 to Minamoto Yoritomo, already overlord of Japan,
giving him standing right to crush anyone he deemed to be
disturbing the peace, and to appoint provincial officials to
supervise the country. This new regime was known as the Kamakura
shogunate, since Yoritomo kept his <i>bakufu</i> (literally
&quot;tent government&quot;) at Kamakura, away from corrupting
court life in Kyoto. After Yoritomo's death in 1199, his line
died out, and was supplanted by his in-laws, the Hojo, who
installed aristocrats as puppet shoguns while governing as
regents. Interrupted by the anti-Hojo &quot;restoration&quot; of
1333-1336 led by Emperor Go-Daigo, shogunal rule was restored by
the Ashikaga, who governed in alliance with the daimyo, until
daimyo rivalries exploded around 1470. This period was known as
the Muromachi shogunate after the Ashikaga residence in Kyoto's
Muromachi district. The last Ashikaga shogun abdicated in 1588,
but power had already passed to Oda Nobunaga and Toyotomi
Hideyoshi, military hegemons of Japan. Tokugawa Ieyasu then
became shogun in 1603. Tokugawa shoguns governed for over 250
years, a period called Edo after their capital Edo (now Tokyo).
Tokugawa rule lasted until 1867, when its impotence against
Western encroachment led to a radical rebellion to
&quot;restore&quot; direct imperial rule, the Meiji Restoration.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Minamoto Yoritomo</b></font><font
size="4" face="Arial"> </font><font size="2" face="Arial">(1147-1199),
Japanese warrior and founder of the shogunate&#151;a feudal form
of government that lasted nearly 700 years. Born into the
Minamoto family, a powerful military clan of imperial descent,
Yoritomo was exiled as a youth after an abortive rebellion in
1160 against the rival Taira family in which his father died. He
married into the family of one of his jailers, the Hojo clan, who
later became shoguns after his death. In 1180 he joined another
Minamoto rebellion and established headquarters at Kamakura. His
cousin Yoshinaka drove the Taira out of the capital Kyoto in
1183, but when his forces caused unrest in the capitalYorimoto
crushed him with the help of his brilliant half-brother Minamoto
Yoshitsune. Yoritomo now set up an independent government at
Kamakura to control his samurai followers, which was duly
recognized by the imperial court. In 1185 Minamoto forces under
Yoshitsune smashed the Taira in the naval battle of Dannoura.
Jealous of his half-brother, Yoritomo then began hounding him,
using imperial sanction to appoint constables and stewards
throughout Japan to seek out the fugitive. Yoshitsune was forced
into suicide in 1189, and these new officials became the limbs of
Yoritomo's national government. Keeping his base in Kamakura,
Yoritomo declined to usurp the throne, but took for himself in
1192 the ancient title of shogun (&quot;generalissimo&quot;),
giving him the perpetual right to act independently against any
rebel. The Minamoto clan held power only until 1219, when the
line died out and was replaced by the Hojo, but Yoritomo's
shogunate set the pattern for governmental structure in Japan
until the Meiji Restoration of 1868.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Ashikaga (family),</b></font><font
size="4" face="Arial"> </font><font size="2" face="Arial">Japanese
family that occupied the office of shogun from 1338 to 1573,
known as the Muromachi period because the shogun's palace was in
the Muromachi district of Kyoto. The Ashikaga were descended from
the Minamoto family which established Japan's first shogunate in
1185. The line's founder, Ashikaga Takauji, rebelled in 1333
against the last Hojo shogun in favour of Emperor Go-Daigo.
Following a power struggle under Go-Daigo's new regime he
rebelled again, set up a rival emperor from the alternative
northern branch of the imperial family at Kyoto in 1336, and had
himself appointed shogun. Civil war continued until 1392, when
one of Go-Daigo's successors renounced his claim to the throne.
The Ashikaga then tried to reunify the country, but were unable
ever to fully control the daimyo. Yoshimitsu (reigned 1369-1395)
was the most effective Ashikaga shogun, playing off the leading
daimyo, but under Yoshinori (reigned 1429-1441), the Ashikaga
lost control of the eastern Kanto region. Ashikaga Yoshimasa
(reigned 1449-1474) was unable to stop the devastating Onin War
(1467-1477) between the great daimyo, and after he abdicated in
1474 to devote himself to the arts, a succession dispute hastened
the family's decline. The Ashikaga shoguns became puppets of the
contending daimyo in the bitter fighting of the 16th century, the
so-called Epoch of Warring States. The Ashikaga shogunate was
finally brought down by the warlord Oda Nobunaga, who first
installed then (1573) toppled the last Ashikaga shogun, Yoshiaki
(reigned 1568-1588). Despite their uneven political record, the
Ashikaga shoguns, especially Yoshimitsu and Yoshinori, were great
patrons of the arts, responsible for the brilliant Muromachi
culture and for such masterpieces as Kyoto's Golden Pavilion. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Daimyo</b></font><font size="4"
face="Arial"> </font><font size="2" face="Arial">(Jap.,
&quot;great holders of private land&quot;), feudal lords who
dominated Japan from the 12th to the 19th century. They arose as
leaders of the samurai (warrior) class, who during the peaceful
Heian period (790-1185) administered provincial estates for the
civil nobility residing in the capital Kyoto. In 1192 a member of
this class, Minamoto Yoritomo, established a military
dictatorship as shogun. He and his successors, the Hojo and the
Ashikaga shoguns, rewarded followers with lucrative
administrative rights over noble estates, creating the daimyo
families. All were potential rivals for power unless checked by
central authority. When this collapsed in the 15th and 16th
centuries, the great daimyo destroyed each other and were
replaced by sengoku (Warring State) daimyo, who feuded constantly
and actually owned their lands, which they ruled from castles.
Unity was finally restored by the daimyo leader Oda Nobunaga and
his successors Toyotomi Hideyoshi and Tokugawa Ieyasu, who
founded the Tokugawa shogunate in 1603. Under the Tokugawa there
were between 200 and 300 daimyo families, all virtually
autonomous within their own estates but subordinated to the
shogun and obliged to leave their families as hostages in Edo
(Tokyo) and to attend him regularly there. The daimyo were
officially defined as lords whose lands yielded over 10,000 <i>koku</i>
(1,800,000 litres) of rice annually. The daimyo class was
abolished in 1871, after the fall of the shogunate, and its
members absorbed into a new pensioned nobility. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Meiji</b></font><font size="4"
face="Arial"> </font><font size="2" face="Arial">(1852-1912),
emperor of Japan (1867-1912), born Prince Mutsuhito and the 122nd
emperor in the traditional count, whose accession to the throne
marked the beginning of a national revolution known as the Meiji
Restoration. In 1868, soon after Prince Mutsuhito became emperor,
taking the name Meiji (&quot;enlightened government&quot;),
radical nationalist groups working for a stronger Japan united
under the emperor, and toppled the Tokugawa shogunate, replacing
it with a unified administration headed by the sovereign. As part
of the new regime's policies, Meiji became the first emperor to
live in Tokyo rather than Kyoto, the traditional imperial
capital. Although the emperor in time became an influential force
in the government, he functioned mainly as a symbol of national
unity, leaving the actual business of governing to his ministers.
His presence was essential to the new government as a source of
legitimacy, as a sanction for its transformation of Japan, and as
the centre of the authoritarian cult of State Shinto which it
introduced. During his reign, Japan became an industrial power
able to compete with the nations of the West. The Meiji shrine in
the centre of Tokyo was built in his honour.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Tokugawa,</b></font><font
size="4" face="Arial"> </font><font size="2" face="Arial">Tokugawa,
dynasty of Japanese shoguns who ruled the country from 1600 to
1868, called the Edo period after the Tokugawa capital at Edo
(modern Tokyo). Tokugawa Ieyasu founded the line when he accepted
the title of shogun from the emperor in 1603, after pacifying the
country in 1600, and law codes issued in his name in 1615
underpinned its structure. Most daimyo had sworn fealty to
Ieyasu, and Tokugawa estates comprising a quarter of Japan's
farmland made him effectively supreme daimyo. Tokugawa authority
over other daimyo was consolidated by obliging them to leave
wives and families as permanent hostages at Edo, and to attend
the shoguns in the capital every second year. Though virtually
unchallenged rulers within their estates, the daimyo held their
lands in fief from the Tokugawa, who could (and did) confiscate
them in punishment. The emperors lived in luxurious impotence in
Kyoto, subsidized and monitored by the Tokugawa. To preserve
stability, society was formally divided into four
classes&#151;samurai, farmers, artisans, and merchants&#151;and
contact with the world beyond Japan heavily restricted. Coins,
weights, and measures were standardized, road networks improved,
and detailed legal codes and admonitions issued. The Tokugawa
peace, and the constant traffic of rich daimyo to and from Edo,
brought Japan unprecedented prosperity, making it one of the
world's most sophisticated pre-modern commercial societies, but
the resulting population boom outstripped natural resources,
leading to endemic peasant unrest. Also, the rigid Tokugawa
administration, which surrounded the shogun with ministers and
advisers, impeded response to growing colonialist encroachment.
Finally, pro-imperial radicals from remote daimyo domains in
western Japan unreconciled to Tokugawa overlordship toppled the
dynasty in the Meiji Restoration. The 15th Tokugawa shogun fell
in 1868, and became a member of the new Meiji aristocracy.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Hojo,</b></font><font size="4"
face="Arial"> </font><font size="2" face="Arial">Japanese family
of Taira descent that ruled Japan as hereditary regents (<i>shikken</i>)
from 1199 to 1333, a period known as the Kamakura Shogunate from
the shogunal base at Kamakura. The Hojo gained prominence under
the first shogun, Minamoto Yoritomo, who married into the family.
His father-in-law, Hojo Tokimasa, became the regent for
Yoritomo's young heir in 1199. By 1219, when the main Minamoto
line was cut short by assassination, the Hojo were entrenched in
power, and soon set up the legal and institutional structure of
shogunal rule. In Japanese fashion, however, they left intact the
puppet shogunate, which in turn pulled the strings of a puppet
emperor. The clan ruled ably until the late 13th century, leading
national resistance to the Mongol invasions of 1274 and 1281, but
they later tended to become inept and dissolute. The last Hojo
regent killed himself in 1333 during the restoration led by
Emperor Go-Daigo which led to its replacement by the Ashikaga
shogunate.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Okazaki,</b></font><font

Japan on southern Honshu, in Aichi Prefecture, on the Yahagi
River near Nagoya. A road junction on the Tokaido rail line, it

Okazaki Park is the feudal castle that was the birthplace of
Ieyasu, founder of the Tokugawa shogunate. Population (1990)

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Samurai,</b></font><font
size="4" face="Arial"> </font><font size="2" face="Arial">warrior
class in Japan, or a member of that class. Samurai first arose as
provincial administrators acting for absentee estate-owning
courtiers who remained in the capital Kyoto. In the unruly
provinces, these officials were recruited from local warrior
clans bound by bonds of fealty, and led by offshoots of the
imperial family, such as the Taira and Minamoto family. By the
beginning of the feudal period in the 12th century, the term had
come to denote the military retainers of a daimyo, who was a
feudal baron under the shogun, or military governor, of Japan.
The replacement of the Hojo shogunate with the Ashikaga shogunate
in the 14th century led to an even more feudal system, where
samurai held lands awarded by their daimyo lords, and collected
taxes from peasants. During the turbulent 15th and 16th
centuries, the samurai formed the backbone of the clan armies
whose feuds convulsed Japan. The Tokugawa shogunate, which
finally restored stable government in 1603, segregated the
samurai in castle towns. The now samurai formed a distinct class
in the rigid Tokugawa system, wearing two swords as a symbol of
their caste and following a rigid code of ethics known as
bushido. In the peaceful Edo period, the samurai became shogunal
or diamyo officials, or simply idle stiperdiaries. Poverty led
some to renounce their status or take up trades; others became
important scholars or artists. In 1867 the last shogun resigned,
and the samurai class lost its privileges in 1871 when the whole
feudal system was abolished. The daimyo returned their lands to
the emperor, both nobles and retainers were granted pensions, and
the practice of wearing swords was prohibited. In 1878, the names
<i>daimyo</i> and <i>samurai</i> were changed to <i>kazoku,</i>
or nobility, and <i>shizoku,</i> or gentry, respectively.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Ronin,</b></font><font size="4"
face="Arial"> </font><font size="2" face="Arial">class of
masterless samurai, who had lost their place in the normal
loyalty pattern of Japanese feudal society. Samurai could become
ronin for various reasons, such as the death of their lord, their
own transgressions, or defeat in battle. Although some ronin,
once they had lost their fiefs, became farmers or even monks,
others found it difficult to adjust to their new status and
tended to become a disruptive element, sometimes resorting to
banditry. The peace established by the Tokugawa shogunate in 1603
drove many to take up professions. The famous incident of the 47
ronin took place in 1703. While attending the shogun at Edo (now
Tokyo) in 1701, the young daimyo Asano Naganori, lord of Ako
domain, attacked Kira, the shogun's master of etiquette, who had
supposedly provoked him beyond endurance, inside the shogunal
castle. For this crime, he was ordered to commit hara-kiri, and
his estates were forfeited. Now ronin, 47 of his followers swore
vengence on Kira, and spent two years planning their revenge.
They stormed Kira's mansion, killed him, and presented his head
at Asano's grave. The ronin were ordered to commit suicide, and
were buried near their master's grave. An example of bushido, the
samurai code of ethics, at its noblest, the incident became a
favourite theme of fiction and drama.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Bushido</b></font><font
size="4" face="Arial"> </font><font size="2" face="Arial">(Japanese,
&quot;the way of the warrior&quot;), code of ethics observed by
the warrior noblemen, or samurai, of feudal Japan. Like the rules
of chivalry that prevailed in medieval Europe, Bushido was based
on such virtues as rectitude, endurance, frugality, courage,
politeness, veracity, and, especially, loyalty to ruler and
country. Only through the exercise of these virtues could a
knight maintain his honour, and one who had forfeited honour was
compelled to commit suicide by hara-kiri. Fully developed by the
late 12th century, Bushido became a written code in the 16th
century. When feudalism was abolished (by about the middle of the
19th century), the code was abandoned, but its influence, mainly
on the army, persisted.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Feudalism,</b></font><font
size="4" face="Arial"> </font><font size="2" face="Arial">contractual
system of political and military relationships existing among
members of the nobility in Western Europe during the High Middle
Ages. (It had nothing to do with blood feuds; the two words came
to be spelled alike in the 17th century, but have no etymological
relationship.) Feudalism was characterized by the granting of
fiefs, chiefly in the form of land and labour, in return for
political and military services&#151;a contract sealed by oaths
of homage and fealty (fidelity). But lord and vassal were both
free men and social peers, and feudalism must not be confused
with seignorialism, the system of relations between the lords and
their peasants in the same period. Feudalism joined political and
military service with landholding to preserve medieval Europe
from disintegrating into innumerable independent seigneuries
after the fall of the Carolingian Empire.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Origins, </b>When the German
invaders conquered the western Roman Empire in the 5th century,
they destroyed the professional Roman army and substituted their
own armies, made up of warriors who served their chieftains for
honour and booty. The warriors fought on foot and lived off the
land. As long as they fought one another, they needed no cavalry.
But when the Muslims, Vikings, and Magyars invaded Europe in the
8th, 9th, and 10th centuries, the Germans found themselves unable
to deal with these rapid-moving armies. First, Charles Martel in
Gaul, then King Alfred in England, and finally Henry the Fowler
of Germany provided horses for some of their soldiers to repel
the raids into their lands. It is not certain that these troops
fought on horseback, but they could pursue their enemies faster
mounted than on foot, and as stirrups were then coming into use,
it is probable that cavalry actions began to take place in this
same period. They were certainly occurring in the 11th century. <i>See
also</i> Chivalry.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><i>Early System </i></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">War horses were expensive, and
training in their use took years of practice. To support his
cavalry soldiers, Martel gave them estates farmed by dependent
labourers, which he took from the church. Such estates, called
benefices, were given for the duration of the soldiers' service.
The soldiers were called vassals (from a Gaelic word meaning
servant). The vassals, however, being selected soldiers with whom
the Carolingian rulers surrounded themselves, became models for
the nobles who followed the court. With the breakup of the
Carolingian Empire in the 9th century, many powerful men strove
to assemble their own bands of mounted vassals, giving them
benefices in return for their services. Some of the weaker
landowners then found themselves obliged to enter into vassalage
and to concede their lands to the lordship of the more powerful,
receiving them back as benefices. The greater lords were expected
to protect their vassals, as the vassals were expected to serve
their benefactors.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><i>Classical Feudalism </i></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">These military relationships of
the 8th and 9th centuries are sometimes described as Carolingian
feudalism, but they lack some of the essential features of
classical feudalism, which developed in and after the 10th
century. It was only towards the year 1000 that the term <i>fief</i>
began to be used instead of <i>benefice,</i> and the change of
term reflected a change in the institution. Now the estate given
a vassal was commonly understood to be hereditary, provided the
vassal's heir was satisfactory to the lord, and provided he paid
an inheritance tax called a relief. The vassal not only took the
oath of fealty, which everyone owed to his lord, but also a
special oath of homage to the feudal lord who invested him with a
fief. Thus, feudalism was a political as well as military
institution, one based upon a contract between two individuals,
both of whom held rights in the fief.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><i>Reasons for the Feudal Pattern </i></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Warfare was endemic in the feudal
period, but feudalism did not cause warfare; warfare caused
feudalism. Nor was feudalism responsible for the collapse of the
Carolingian Empire; rather, the failure of that state made
feudalism necessary. The Carolingian Empire collapsed because it
was based on the rule of one man, who did not have institutions
sufficiently well developed to carry out his will. The empire's
disappearance threatened Europe with anarchy: thousands of
individual seigneurs who would be ruling their people entirely
independent of any suzerain authority. The bonds of feudalism
reknit the local seigneuries into a loose unity, under which the
seigneurs gave up only as much of their freedom as was essential
to effective cooperation. Under the leadership of their feudal
lords, the united vassals were able to fend off invaders and then
to create feudal principalities of some size and complexity. When
feudalism proved its worth on a local basis, kings and emperors
adopted it to strengthen their monarchies.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Maturity, </b>Feudalism reached
its maturity in the 11th century and flourished in the 12th and
13th centuries. Its cradle was the region between the Rhine and
the Loire, but in the late 11th century rulers of that region
conquered southern Italy and Sicily, England, and, with the First
Crusade, the Holy Land. To each place they took their feudal
institutions. Southern France, Spain, northern Italy, and Germany
also adopted some degree of feudalism in the 12th century. Even
central and eastern Europe came under its spell to a limited
degree, especially after the Byzantine Empire was feudalized
following the Fourth Crusade. But the &quot;feudalisms&quot; of
ancient Egypt and Persia, or of China and Japan, were not related
to European feudalism and generally were only superficially
similar. Perhaps the Japanese samurai most resembled medieval
knights, particularly under the Ashikaga shoguns (1336-1573), but
the relationships between lords and vassals in Japan were
different from those of Western feudalism.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><i>Characteristics </i></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">In its classical form Western
feudalism assumed that most or, in England, all of the land
belonged to the sovereign prince&#151;be he king or duke, marquis
or count&#151;who held it &quot;of no one but God&quot;. The
prince then granted fiefs to his barons, who made their oaths of
homage and fealty to him and were required to give him political
and military service according to the terms of the grant. The
barons, in turn, might grant portions of their fiefs to knights
who swore homage and fealty to them and served them according to
their grants. Thus, if a king granted a fief of a dozen
seigneuries to a baron and required the service of ten knights,
the baron could grant ten of the seigneuries to ten knights and
thus be prepared to provide the required service to the king. Of
course, a baron might seek to keep all his fief in his demesne
(his personal domain) and keep his knights in his hall, feeding
and arming them out of his own pocket; but this was resisted by
the knights, who wanted to be seigneurs themselves. Knights might
acquire two or more fiefs, and then they too might find it
desirable to subgrant what they needed to provide the service for
which they were obliged. By such subinfeudation, a feudal pyramid
was created, with the suzerain at the top, each mesne lord below,
and a feudal force of knights to serve him at his summons.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Complications occurred when a
knight accepted fiefs from more than one lord, but the
institution of liege homage was invented to enable him to declare
one of his lords his liege lord, whom he would serve personally,
while he would send his vassals to serve his other lords. It was
also the rule in France that &quot;the lord of my lord is not my
lord&quot;; thus, it was not rebellion for a subvassal to fight
against his lord's lord. In England, however, William the
Conqueror and his successors required their vassals' vassals to
take oaths of fealty to them.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><i>Duties of a Vassal </i></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Military service in the field was
fundamental to feudalism, but it was far from all that the vassal
owed to his lord. When the lord had a castle, he might require
his vassals to garrison it, a service called castle-guard. The
lord also expected his vassals to attend his court in order to
give him advice and to participate in judgments of cases
concerning other vassals. If the lord had need of money, he might
expect his vassals to give him financial aid. During the 12th and
13th centuries many conflicts between lords and their vassals
arose over just what services should be rendered. In England it
was the Magna Carta that defined the obligations of the king's
vassals; for example, they did not have to give financial aid
except on the occasion of the marriage of the king's eldest
daughter, the knighting of his eldest son, and the king's own
ransom. In France it was common to find a fourth occasion for
feudal aid: a lord's crusade. Giving advice also led to a demand
by the vassals that their assent be sought on those of their
lords' decisions that involved them, whether it be war, marriage
alliance, taxation, or legal judgment.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><i>Inheritance and Wardship </i></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Another area of feudal custom that
required definition was that of succession to fiefs. When fiefs
became hereditary, the lord reserved an inheritance tax called a
relief, and the size of the relief was often a matter of
conflict. Again, in England, the Magna Carta established the
relief as £100 for a barony and £5 for a knight's fee;
elsewhere, custom varied from fief to fief. Lords reserved the
right to secure a useful and loyal holder of a fief. If a vassal
died and left a son who was of age and a good knight, the lord
had no reason to object to his succession. If the son was a
minor, however, or if the heir was female, the lord would want to
control the fief until the heir came of age or the heiress
married a man the lord approved of; thus arose the lord's right
of wardship for a minor or female heir and his further right of
marriage, which might, in some fiefs, lead to his choosing the
partner himself. The widow of a vassal had a lifetime right of
dower in her husband's fief (commonly a third of the value), and
this also led to the lord's interest in her remarriage; in some
fiefs he had a full right to control such a remarriage. In the
event of a vassal dying without issue, the relationship of his
heirs to the lord could vary: brothers were usually acceptable
but cousins might not be. If no heirs were acceptable to the
lord, the fief was declared an escheat and returned to his full
control; he could then keep it in his demesne or grant it to any
knight he chose to make his vassal.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><i>Breach of Contract </i></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Because the feudal relationship
was contractual, false actions on either side could cause breach
of contract. When the vassal failed to perform required services,
the lord could bring charges against him in his court before the
other vassals, and if they found their peer guilty, he would be
declared to have forfeited his fief, which would return to the
lord's demesne. If the vassal chose to try to defend his land,
the lord might have to go to war against him to win control of
the forfeited fief. But the fact that the vassal's peers had
found him guilty meant that they were morally as well as legally
obligated to enforce their judgment, and it was a rare vassal who
would war against his lord and all his peers. On the other hand,
if a vassal felt that his lord had failed to live up to his
obligations, he could defy the lord&#151;that is, formally break
faith with him&#151;declaring he would no longer accept him as
lord but would continue to keep the fief as his own demesne or
take it to another lord who might accept him as vassal. Because
the lord often regarded defiance as rebellion, defiant vassals
had to have strong support or be prepared for a war they might
lose.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><i>Royal Authority </i></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Monarchs during the feudal period
had other sources of authority besides their feudal suzerainty.
The renaissance of classical learning included the revival of
Roman law, with its traditions of powerful rulers and territorial
government. The Church looked on rulers as divinely ordained, and
by anointment gave them a sacred right. The resurgence of trade
and industry brought into being towns and a powerful urban class
that looked to princes to maintain the freedom and order required
for business activities. These townspeople also demanded a role
in government in keeping with their wealth. In Italy they
organized communes that won control of the countryside from the
feudal nobles and even forced them to live in some of the cities.
North of the Alps the townspeople sent representatives to the
monarchs' councils and developed parliamentary institutions to
give them a voice in government equal to that of the feudality.
With the taxes from the towns, the princes were able to hire
civil servants and professional troops. Thus, they were able both
to impose their will on the feudality and to make themselves
largely independent of the service of their vassals.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Decline, </b>During the 13th
century feudalism reached the zenith of its development and then
began to decline. Subinfeudation had reached the point where
superior lords had difficulty obtaining the service to which they
were entitled. Vassals typically preferred to give monetary
payments&#151;called scutage, or shield money&#151;instead of
personal military service to their lords, and the lords
themselves tended to prefer the money because it enabled them to
hire professional troops that were often better trained and
disciplined than the vassals. Moreover, a revival of infantry
tactics and the introduction of such new weapons as the longbow
and the pike, made cavalry tactics less certain of victory. In
the 14th and 15th centuries the decline of feudalism accelerated.
During the Hundred Years' War, the chivalry of France and England
fought bravely and gloriously, but the battles were largely won
by professional men-at-arms and especially by the archers on
foot. The professionals fought in companies whose leaders took
oaths of homage and fealty to a prince, but under contracts that
were not hereditary and usually for a term of months or years.
This &quot;bastard feudalism&quot; was but a step away from
purely mercenary fighting, and in Italy the Renaissance <i>condottieri</i>,
some of whom were Englishmen trained in transalpine war, had
already made that transition.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Role in Political Development, </b>The
fief was embedded in the customary law of western Europe, and the
incidents of feudalism, such as wardship and marriage, escheat
and forfeiture, continued to flourish after feudal military
service died out. In England feudal tenures were abolished by
statute in 1660, but they lingered on in parts of the Continent
until the customary law was replaced by Roman law, a process
completed by Napoleon. Roman law substituted other legal notions
for feudal ones on the Continent, but in England the common law
continued to be basically feudal. Wherever English people settled
in the modern era, they took their common law with them and
established feudal principles all over the world. English
constitutionalism is fundamentally feudal, based on the contract
theory of government. When John Locke wrote his treatises on
government in the 17th century, he was seeking to generalize for
all persons the feudal contract that limited the rights of the
suzerain over his vassals and retained for them the German
warrior's independence. The United States Declaration of
Independence was a classic act of feudal defiance, as the
Continental Congress enumerated the tyrannical acts of the king
and declared the colonists no longer bound by their allegiance to
him. Nineteenth-century liberalism and 20th-century
libertarianism owe their basic premises to feudalism. In sum,
feudal ideas were a vital part of the political development of
Western civilization, reconciling authority with liberty by way
of contract.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Hara-Kiri</b></font><font
size="4" face="Arial"> </font><font size="2" face="Arial">(Jap.,
&quot;belly-cutting&quot;), Japanese practice of ceremonial
suicide by disembowelment, a method originally restricted by
custom to nobles and later adopted by all classes. The term is
also used to signify any suicide performed for the sake of
personal honour. Hara-kiri originated in feudal Japan, when it
was used by samurai, or warrior noblemen, to avoid the dishonour
of capture by their enemies. It later became virtually an
indirect method of execution, whereby a noble on receiving a
message from the mikado, or emperor, that his death was essential
to imperial welfare, performed hara-kiri.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">In most cases of so-called
obligatory hara-kiri, a richly ornamented dagger accompanied the
imperial message, to be used as the suicide weapon. A specified
number of days was allotted to the offender for his preparations
for the ceremony. A red-carpeted dais was constructed in the home
of the offending noble, or in a temple. At the beginning of the
final ceremony, the nobleman, dressed in ceremonial costume and
attended by a group of friends and officials, took his place on
the dais. Assuming a kneeling position, he prayed, took the
dagger from the representative of the emperor, and publicly
avowed his guilt; then, stripping to the waist, he plunged the
dagger into the left side of his abdomen, drawing it slowly
across to the right side and making a slight upwards cut. At the
final moment a friend or kinsman beheaded the dying nobleman.
Subsequently, the blood-stained dagger was customarily sent to
the emperor as proof of the death of the nobleman by hara-kiri.
If the offender committed voluntary hara-kiri, that is, acted on
his own guilty conscience rather than by order of the emperor,
his honour was considered restored and his entire estate went to
his family. If hara-kiri had been ordered by the emperor,
however, half the property of the suicide was confiscated by the
State.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">As practised by persons of all
classes, hara-kiri frequently served as an ultimate gesture of
devotion to a superior who had died, or as a form of protest
against some act or policy of the government. The practice
eventually became so widespread that for centuries an estimated
total of 1,500 deaths occurred annually by this method; more than
half of these were voluntary acts.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Hara-kiri as an obligatory form of
suicide (self-execution) was abolished in 1868. Incidences of it
as a form of voluntary suicide are rare in modern times. However,
many Japanese soldiers in recent wars, including World War II,
resorted to hara-kiri to escape the perceived ignominy of defeat
or capture.</font></p>
