Welcome to "The Wanderer's Road", home of the <em>Ronin</em>, vagabonds, brigands, and other nomads who appear in the pages of USAGI YOJIMBO. There is actually no one location of The Wanderer's Road, as it stretches the length of 17th Century Feudal Japan, from Hokkaido to Kyushu.  Most of the activity which occurs in <em>Usagi Yojimbo</em>, occurs on the main island of Honshu. The Wanderer's Road is a road leading to no physical destination, but rather a mental or spiritual one. "The Road to Hell", "The Warrior's Pilgramige"... these are but mere pathways along the infinite journey that is The Wanderer's Road.

First Issue Appearance: <em>Albedo</em> Vol. 1, No. 2<br>
Caste: Ronin Samurai<br>
Profession: Bodygaurd for hire<br> 
Fighting Proficiency: Katana and Wakizashi, archery, hand-to hand combat,
bujutsu.<br>
Anthropomorphic Identity: Rabbit<br>
Clan Allegiance: Formerly Mifune<br>
Famous Quote: "RYAAAAAAA!!!"<br>
Character Profile: Usagi is a gentlemen among samurai, particularly RONIN,
who have a habit of being corrupt at times. Born in a quaint village in
the Northern Province, he became a vassel to Lord Mifune, shortly after
learning the way of the Samurai from Sensei Katsuichi. As a samurai, he
was a true example of loyalty. Unfortunately, his arch nemesis, Lord Hikiji,
destroyed his life as a samurai by defeating his Lord Mifune at the Battle
of Adachi Plain. Since then, Usagi has been a ronin, a masterless samurai.
During his travels around Feudal Japan, Usagi has met up with many people,
both friends and foes. Usagi is on a warrior's pilgramage, to hone his skills
as a samurai. His skills with the blade are unbelievable. He is able
to single handedly defeat multiple adversaries in minutes. But he in not
invincible. Most notably is the scar over his left eye, made by the infamous
Lord Hikiji. Usagi seeks peace, but hires himself out as a bodygaurd for those
in need. Tends to help the innocent and weak. Very warm-hearted and generous.
Prefers to avoid a fight if he can, but never runs from a battle.<br>

<B>Character Profile:</B>Gennosuke began life in difficult fashion, 
he and his mother following his father on a mission of revenge on 
behald of Lady Asano of clan Shirageta. Gen was taught how to fight
by his father, but came to resent him because of his cold samurai 
ways.

he turned his hand to bounty hunting. 
	<P>Gen 'befriended' Usagi while attempting to con him into 
helping him kill a group of bandits. Gen is extremely good at 
his chosen profession, and while he claims to have no sense of honour 
there is something about Gen that makes those that are his friends 
convinced that he is neither heartless or stupid. He is a loyal to 
his money, but no matter how much he denies it, he is loyal to his 
friends first.

hunter; a loner dependant upon no one. Chasing the reward on General 
Fujii's head, he met up with Gen and after a little jockeying, settled
 into an uneasy truce. The two of them met up with Usagi, who was after 
Fujii to retrieve his swords and the three of them, along with their 
guide, Hanago track down the outlaw. 
	<P>Once Fujii was killed, Inukai took Hanago hostage so 
that he could claim the entire bounty for himself. A dishonourable act, 
however Inukai is shown to have ulterior motives which prove him a 
little less heartless and cold than he would have people believe.

<B>Clan Allegiance:</B> None <br>
<B>Famous Quote:</B> You cannot hide your true nature from
 the gods! <br>
<p>
<B>Character Profile:</B> Jei is somewhat of an enigma. His true origin
 is unknown, but he claims to be a messenger from the gods, sent to 
seek out and destroy the evil in his world. No one is sure whether he
 really is a divine emissary or just a samurai that has lost all traces
 of sanity. Besides his demonic eyes and chilling voice, adding weight
 to his argument is his apparent reincarnation after his first battle
 with Usagi Yojimbo. Discrediting his claim is the fact that he 
attacked Usagi Yojimbo, known for his noble and benevolent manner. 
Perhaps there is something buried within Usagi that is not apparent 
to those close to him. Jei's body was seemingly obliterated by a 
lightning strike, yet he returned, some time later to kidnap Usagi's 
son; Jotaro and gain his revenge on Usagi. Usagi Prevailed once again 
on this occasion, with Jei being hurled over a clif, his own yari 
embedded in his side, however it is not known whether he was killed 
or not. It seems he has been spotted alive and may be after Usagi, 
who's death Jei is convinced will make him a god. Insane or not, Jei 
seems to have at least some supernatural ability and is a master 
with the Yari. Few can stand against him.

Falling madly in lust with Usagi, Kimie begged Usagi to take her with

explained the hardships of a life on the road. 
	<P>Her betrothed, Nobu was overcome by jealousy, and tried 
with partial success, to rally the town against the wandering Samurai. 
Usagi had his own problems however, with the Shi assassins and Kimie, 
wanting to see him in action, is taken hostage by one. Nobu comes to 
the rescue, allowing Usagi to kill the assassin, but nobu, not content 
with this, challenges Usagi to a duel. Usagi stares the boy down with 
barely controlled bloodlust in his eyes and leaves. Kimie's romantic 
notions are shattered and she winds up marrying Nobu.

his best to look after the youth the lord left as his heir. Other advisers, 
jealous of his position, framed him in a scandal that ruined his reputation

	<P>Usagi saved a messenger of the magistrate from thugs and was shown 
the old samurai's hospitality. Talking at length with him and his manservant 
Monshiro, Usagi discovered that the old man had a terminal illness. Oyaneko, 
frustrated at his inability to defeat this sickness, desired death as a 
warrior, and surprised Usagi as he left the town, challenging him to a duel 
in  a lonely mountain pass. Although blades were crossed, Usagi refused to 
kill the old man, and Oyaneko could not needlessly cause the death of a 
friend. He returned to his town to serve his people.
	<P>Three weeks later, Oyaneko passed on, not long after the
