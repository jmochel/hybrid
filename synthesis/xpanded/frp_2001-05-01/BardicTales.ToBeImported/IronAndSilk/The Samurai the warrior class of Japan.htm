<H2>
The warrior class of Japan.</H2>
&nbsp;<B><FONT COLOR="#000099">From the latter part of the Heian era (794-1185),the
warriors of Japan were called <I>bushi</I> (buu-she), a term that had been
introduced from China. In earlier times, court officials who waited upon
the emperor were known as <I>saburo-bitto</I>, from the word <I>saburo</I>,
which means "to serve" or "wait upon." Bushi assigned to guard the emperor
came to be known as <I>saburai</I>. By the thirteenth century, hereditary
warriors, as well as officials serving princes, court ministers, and other
persons of high rank, were called <I>saburai</I>.</FONT></B>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR><B><FONT COLOR="#000099">Saburai originally referred only to higher
class warriors and court officials. Eventually it was changed to <I>samurai</I>
just to make it easier to pronounce. Japan's famous class of samurai warriors
was further strengthened by an institution established in 1185 by Minamoto
Yoritomo , a few years before he set up the country's first shogunate government.</FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000099">War played a central part in the history of
Japan. Warring clans controlled much of the country. A chief headed each
clan; made up of related families. The chiefs were the decendents of Japan's
imperial family. The wars were usually about "land." Only 20% of the land
was fit for farming. The struggle for control of that land eventually gave
rise to the Samurai.</FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000099">The Samurai rose out of these continuing battles
for land among three main&nbsp;<IMG SRC="batle readying samurai2.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=198 WIDTH=149 ALIGN=LEFT>clans:
the Minamoto, the Fujiwara and the Taira. The Samurai eventually became
a class unto themselves between the 9th and 12th centuries A.D. They were
called by two names: Samurai (knights-retainers) and Bushi (warriors).
Some of them were related to the ruling class. Others were hired men. They
gave complete loyalty to their Daimyo (feudal landowners) and received
land and position in return. Each Daimyo used his Samurai to protect his
land and to expand his power and rights to more land.</FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000099">Achieving military success in the country,
Yoritomo obtained permission from the emperor to establish a system of
<I>shugo</I> (shuu-go) or "guards". for all of the districts and provinces
as a means of keeping order.</FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000099">The position of shugo gradually became hereditary
and consolidated the development of an elite class of professional warriors.
As the generations passed, these warrior families became clans and grew
to be more powerful than the hereditary lords they served (most of whom
were descendants of noble families from Kyoto). These shugo gradually came
to be known as samurai (which is another reading for "guards"). They developed
a code, based on Confucian and Zen Buddhist principles, that came to be
known as <I>bushido</I>, or the Way of the Warrior. This code was to dictate
virtually every aspect of their lives and influence the total culture of
the country until modern times.</FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000099">The essence of the samurai code of bushido
was total loyalty to the feudal lord; a willingness to give their lives
in the defense of their lord , his honor, and their own; a strict regimen
of martial training; and a sternly refined etiquette that governed their
actions and behavior in all things.</FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000099">Part of the code of the samurai was to commit
suicide rather than be captured in war or dishonored by failure those who
did fail became known as ronin (masterless samurai) and were shunned by
socailty for there failer and dishonour They became beggars, drunks, and
assassins, shunned and feared. Many committed ritual suicide. Many others
threatened to do so at the houses of wealthy lords, embarrassing the lords
into giving them money or food. The code of the samurai applied to the
women, as well as the men, in this elite class.</FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000099">One special category of samurai were the <I>hatamoto</I>
(hah-tah-moe-toe), the higher ranking warriors who were the <I>shogun's</I>
personal guard. During the Tokugawa Shogunate (1600-1867), the hatamoto
were direct vassals of the shogun, and their annual revenue was fixed at
a minimum of 10,000 bushels of rice.</FONT></B>

<P><IMG SRC="TOSHIRO.JPG" BORDER=2 HEIGHT=303 WIDTH=235 ALIGN=RIGHT><B><FONT COLOR="#000099">
Ancient Yayoi warriors developed weapons, armor and a code during the ensuing
centuries that became the centerpiece for the Japanese Samurai. Early weapons
included bows, arrows and swords. Armor included a helmet that protected
head and neck, a breasplate that protected the chest, arm and shoulder
protectors, and a belly wrap. Later armor included protection for the legs
and thighs. Armor changed as the type of battles changed. A big change
occured in the 5th century when horses were introduced to Japan. Another
change occured in the 15th century because of the constancy of war and
the introduction of guns into battle. The code developed from the Chinese
concept of the virtues of warriors doing battle with the Samurai. The samurai
called their code of chivalry Kyuba no michi ("The Way of Horse and Bow")
and Bushido ("The Way of the Warrior").</FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000099">The Samurai became expert in fighting from
horseback and on the ground. They practiced armed and un-armed combat.
The early Samurai emphasized fighting with the bow and arrow. They used
swords for close-in fighting and beheading their enemies. Battles with
the Mongols in the late 13th century led to a change in the Samurai's fighting
style. They began to use their sword more and also made more use of spears
and naginata. The Samurai slowly changed from fighting on horseback to
fighting on foot.</FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000099">In the late 16th century, it became common
for the Samurai to wear two swords (daisho). One was long; the other short.
The long sword (daito - katana) was more than 24 inches. The short sword
(shoto - wakizashi) was between 12 and 24 inches. The Samurai often gave
names to their swords and believed it was the "soul" of their warriorship.
The oldest swords were straight and had their early design in Korea and
China. The Samurai's desire for tougher, sharper swords for battle gave
rise to the curved blade we still have today.</FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000099">The sword had its beginning as iron combined
with carbon. The swordsmith used fire, water, anvil and hammer to shape
the world's best swords. After forging the blade, the sword polisher did
his work to prepare the blade for the "furniture" that surrounded it. Next,
the sword tester took the new blade and cut through the bodies of corpses
or condemned criminals. They started by cutting through the small bones
of the body and moved up to the large bones. Test results were often recorded
on the nakago (the metal piece attaching the sword blade to the handle).</FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000099">Samurai came to have strong influence in the
central political offices by the end of the 11th century, taking the place
of the noble class. During the Japanese feudal era, the military government
was headed by the Shogun, the supreme seigneur of Samurai. The Samurai's
highest priority was loyalty to the Daimyos who ruled under the Shogun.</FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000099">After the privileged class of samurai was abolished
in 1868, the word <I>shizoku</I>, which is the Chinese pronunciation of
the same word, was substituted and extensively used until 1945, so that
formal samurai families were still distinguished from the common people.</FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000099">Even today, in some rural areas of Japan, the
descendants of samurai feudal lords are treated with special respect reminiscent
of the Tokugawa Shogunate, which officially ended in 1867.</FONT></B>
