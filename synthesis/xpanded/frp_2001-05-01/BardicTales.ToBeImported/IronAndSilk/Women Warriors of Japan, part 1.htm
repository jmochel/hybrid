<H3><A NAME="Introduction">Introduction</A></H3> 
<P>The entry of Asian martial arts into the Western world has happened to coincide, through no particular design, with the transformation of women's role in society. For a multitude of reasons, women of the late 20th century have risen into prominence in business, science and as players on the political stage. The victimization of women in domestic violence and sexual/physical assault is still rampant, but it is increasingly countered, both through legislation and political activism, and by women on a personal level through the active pursuit of fighting skills to defend themselves. Women are involved in ever greater numbers in martial arts and self-defense training. </P>
<P>An identification with one's predecessors is a strong desire in most people. One models oneself on a mental image of an ideal, which is often incarnated in heroic myths or tales. For many women, particularly those interested in Japanese martial practice, there is the image of the woman warrior bearing a glaive-like weapon, <A NAME="footone">the</A> <I>naginata</I><SUP><A HREF="wwjnotes.html#endone">1</A></SUP> in the protection of her home, and even on the field of battle. Although a glorious image, it is difficult to separate fact from fancy in an examination of the role of arms-bearing women in past eras of Japan, particularly due to the almost complete dearth of historical records. </P>
<H3><A NAME="History">Early History </A></H3>
<P>The battle-tales of Japan, chronicles of wars in the Heian, Kamakura and Muromachi periods focus almost completely on the deeds of the nobility and warrior classes.  These tales, passed down by blind bards much as Homer's <I>Iliad, </I>present warriors as archetypes: the tragic Loser-Hero, the Warrior-Courtier, the Traitor, the Coward, etc. Women warriors are almost never described or even mentioned. </P>
<P>Women's roles in such tales are slight: the Tragic Heroine who kills herself at the death of her husband, the Loyal Wife who is taken captive, the Stalwart Mother who grooms her son to take vengeance for his dead father, the Merciful Woman whose "weak, feminine" qualities encourage a warrior chieftain to indulge in unmanly empathy, dissuading him from killing the family of his enemy, who later grow up to kill him, and the Seductress, who preoccupies the warrior leader, diverting him from his task with her feminine wiles.  Finally, almost casually mentioned, are women in the mass: slaughtered, or "given" to the warriors as "spoils-of-war." That they were surely raped and often murdered was apparently considered too trivial a fact to even mention in later warrior tales, once the conventions of the <I>genre</I> had been codified, just as the wholesale burning and pillaging of peasants' farms was considered such a matter of course that it ceased to be mentioned, as if such repeated references would only disturb the flow of narrative. Unless one is willing to imagine a conspiracy of silence in which women's role of the battlefield was suppressed in both historical records and battle-tales, it is a fair assumption that <I>onna-musha</I> (women warriors) were very unusual. This is borne out, I believe, by the <U>prominence</U> given to the few women about whom accounts are written.  Interestingly, in the cases of both of the most famous of these women, the <I>naginata</I> was not their weapon of choice.</P>
<P>These most famous women warriors are Tomoe Gozen and Hangaku, sometimes called Itagaki.  In the <I>Heike Monogatari, </I>Tomoe Gozen was a general in the troops of Kiso Yoshinaka, Yoritomo's first attack force. She was described as exceptionally strong and hauntingly beautiful, with pale white skin, like that of a court lady. Her last act, on the verge of Yoshinaka's defeat, is the subject of many plays and poems. She was ordered to retreat because Yoshinaka stated "It would be a disgrace to have it said that Lord Kiso was accompanied by a woman in his final <A NAME="foottwo">battle</A>."<SUP><A HREF="wwjnotes.html#endtwo">2</A></SUP> Rather than simply leave, however, she instead rode directly into a group of the enemy, singling out the strongest. She matched his horse's stride, reached over, sliced off his head with her sword and cast it aside. There is a legend that she was taken captive by Wada Yoshimori and had a son, Asahina, who became the strongest warrior of the later Kamakura era. Tomoe, has not, however, ever been proven as a historical figure, and not for lack of trying. She has exerted a fascination upon the Japanese for hundreds of years in the startling image of a beauteous woman who was also a breaker of wild horses, and the equal of any man. Tomoe is claimed by more than a few <I>naginata </I>traditions as being either their founder, or one of their primordial teachers. There is, however, no historical justification for such a claim. It is, instead, merely an attempt to associate their tradition with a powerful, romantic figure who lived long before their system was even dreamed of.</P>
<P>Hangaku, daughter of the Jo, a warrior <I>(bushi)</I> family of Echigo province, was known for her strength and accuracy with the bow and arrow. During an uprising of Echigo against the central government, she held off the enemy from the roof of a storehouse. After being wounded in both legs by spears and arrows, she was captured, then released in the custody of a famous warrior. There is an account of her later defending the Torizakayama Castle with 3000 soldiers. The enemy numbered 10,000 and she was defeated and killed.</P>
<P>Thus, at least in the earlier periods of the Heian and Kamakura periods, women who became prominent or even present <I>on the field of battle</I> were the exception rather than the rule. This does not indicate, however, that most women were powerless. There is a common image of Japanese femininity based of the accounts we have of those women of the Imperial court, swaddled in layers of kimono and rigid custom, preoccupied with poetry and moon viewing. Such a picture obscures just who the <I>bushi</I> women were, during the ascendancy of their class.  They were originally pioneers, helping to settle new lands, and if need be, becoming fighters, like women of the old western territories in American history. Some <I>bushi </I>clans may even have been led by women at one time or another.  This can be inferred in that women the legal right to function as <I>jito</I> (stewards), who supervised land held in absentia by nobles or temples who did not reside there.</P>
<P>It is believed that <I>bushi</I> women were trained mainly with the <I>naginata</I> because of its versatility against all manner of enemies and weapons, and also, in consideration to the situations in which they would most likely have to take up arms. It is believed that women, generally speaking, defended their homes rather than going off to battle, so it was important to become skilled with a few weapons which offered the best range of tactics to defend against marauders who often attacked on horseback. Therefore, it is believed that women were sometimes adept with the bow for long range effect, and often with the <I>naginata</I>, which was an effective weapon against horse riders at closer range.  In addition, in hand-to-hand fighting on foot, most women are weakest in close quarters where men can bring their greater weight and strength to bear. A strong, lithe women, armed with a <I>naginata, </I>could keep all but the best warriors at a distance, where the advantages of strength, weight, or sword counted for <A NAME="footthree">little</A>.<SUP><A HREF="wwjnotes.html#endthree">3</A></SUP></P>
