<P><FONT color=#000080 size=+1>1. The Emperor</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=5><B>A</B></FONT>lthough the Emperor is the logical apex of this 
structure, most of his time was spent ensconced away from the lower classes who 
were not allowed to lay eyes upon him. In fact, the emperor-figurehead was 
thrilled by any opportunity to leave the Palace and be moved through the streets 
of Heian-Kyo (Kyoto). Ordinarily, his time was spent 'observing' and was never 
allowed to actually do anything. Therefore, many Emperors ultimately become 
Monks, because it allowed them more personal freedom.</P>
<P>The position of 'Emperor of Japan' is truly a historical cipher. Imperial 
power soon came to be destabilized, which heralded the rise of 'classic' 
Japanese feudalism. As the so-called 'Omnipotent Non-Competent', it soon comes 
to pass that his authority is delegated to Regents (<B>Sessho</B>) and the 
<B>Shogun</B> (Japan's top military oligarch).</P>
<P>It could be said that the Emperor is typically controlled by the previous 
Emperor, who historically had been controlled by the <B>Fujiwara</B> family. The 
Fujiwara continually married into the Imperial line to retain sway as 
aristocrats, and rushed headlong into the political fracas that was the court 
microcosm.<BR><BR>

<P></P>
<P>The old hierarchy was not simply abandoned with the establishment of the 
Yamato government; they were in fact re-formed into the <B>kuge</B>, a social 
class of inherited nobility that was intertwined with powerful positions in the 
central government. Since Japan's beginning, a wide social disparity has existed 
between the floating grandeur and culture of the Capital versus the harsh 
reality of life in the provinces. </P>
<P>Immediately below the Emperor socially (and it must be said that some argue 
the existence of a more lateral relationship) were the <B>kuge</B>, being both 
Imperial Descendants and Court Aristocrats. Their lives consisted of detailed 
court ceremony, which was designed to occupy all the spare time they 
had.</P><BR><BR>

width=266></P>
<P>Below were the <B>buke,</B> or the hereditary/official military classes 
established around 1100. The years 1185-1400 make up a transitory, proto-feudal 
period where the central provinces of Japan were set up as geographic extensions 
of the Kuge. As farmers, the original buke living in distant provinces rebelled 
against high taxation, and from them came a form of proto-samurai: farmers who 
could be called to battle in short order (similar to the American 'Minutemen'). 
The <B>buke</B> class, then, encompasses the gamut of warring types, including 
all from the lowest foot-soldier (<B>Ashigaru</B>) to the most illustrious 
governor-general (<B>daimyo</B>). The <B>Samurai</B> are the driving force of 
this feudal society, and as such is a most appropriate case-study for 
understanding the nature of Japanese feudalism.</P><BR>

<P><FONT color=#000080 size=+1>4. The Bonge</FONT></P>
<P>At the bottom of the official hierarchy are the masses of commoners 
(<B>Bonge</B>), who were also known as <B>Kootsunin</B>, <B>Hyakushonin</B>, and 
<B>Eta/Hinin</B>, who were the social 'untouchables' (to allude to Indian 
castes) also known collectively as <B>Burakamin</B>.</P>
<P>These poor unfortunates have the lowest social ranking besides the Ainu, who 
are considered to be 'wild barbarians' anyway. Non-Burakamin commoners were 
therefore eager to distinguish themselves any way possible, and were thus 
stratified into 3 basic categories:</P>
<UL>
  <LI><B>Ryoke</B> - Landowners and Independent Farmers
  <LI><B>Gesakunin</B> - Renters and Tenant Farmers
  <LI><B>Zomin, Nuhi, Genin</B> - Craftsmen and Laborers</LI></UL>
<P>These commoners were to constantly struggle with those who did not work the 
land. For example: after 1200, 95% of Japanese people were supporting the rice 
needs of the elite 5%, which was indicative of their social and economic 
decline. In fact, the farmers would riot regularly; <B>Ji-Samurai</B> 
(proto-Samurai) were then called upon to control them, which presaged the birth 
of the Samurai as an official class.</P>
