<P><FONT size=+2>T</FONT>he organization of land into a standardized system was 
one of the developments necessary to allow the rise of Japan's militarist 
society. Historically, the traditional <B>uji</B> (clans) had maintained 
themselves through basic agriculture while dominating the collective political 
environment. More people and planning were needed, however, in order to create 
the paddy system for rice cultivation (which was developed in the centuries 
before 600 <FONT size=-1>CE</FONT>). </P>
<P>In 645, the Japanese adopted the Chinese 'equal-field' system, whereby all 
rice land was nationalized. The Japanese made modifications to this before 
implementation, which were called the <B>Taika</B> ('great change') reforms, 
whose key goals were asserted in 646. </P>

width=277>They were triggered by the death of the ruling Prince Shotoku in 622, 
whose incapable son accessed the throne and was summarily slain. A new emperor, 
Kotoku, was installed and a new family, the <B>Fujiwara</B>, was created; this 
new family was to breed with and politically dominate the throne for many 
hundreds of years.</P>
<P>The Taika reforms defined extensive sociopolitical changes. Their goal was to 
reestablish Imperial authority and return to the late Emperor Shotoku's plan to 
establish an effective and fair government based on the Chinese models. <IMG

width=245>All private lands were seized and collated for future Imperial 
redistribution, along with all rice lands, according to the aforementioned 
Equal-Field System. To set a royal example, the new prince Naka (who later 
became the Emperor Tenji) donated all his lands to the state.</P>
<P>A new capital was needed; to accomplish this a bureaucracy was necessary, 
along with roads, taxes, a standing army, communication, and an infrastructure. 
In order for the old clans (Uji) to accept this arrangement, they had to be 
bought out by installing them as high-level officials in the new government.</P>
<P>A national capital was then established at Nara (710-784), and this Chinese 
land/taxing system was utilized to provide revenue. All existing rice paddies 
were considered public land that could be freely redistributed by the Emperor, 
and a census was conducted in 670 to determine the nature of the population.</P>
