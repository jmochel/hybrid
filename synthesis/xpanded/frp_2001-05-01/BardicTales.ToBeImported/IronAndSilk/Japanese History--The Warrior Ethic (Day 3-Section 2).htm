inconceivable to the western mind) was all-important in common practice, as a 
warrior would fight bitterly to his last sinew if ordered by his liege to do so; 
in fact, samurai literature dictates that each day one should awake with his 
mind prepared to die that very day. </P>
<P>Consequently, warriors often had to be forcibly blocked from throwing their 
lives away in the heat of battle. The way of the samurai was of death, and of 
desperateness. </P>
<P>This also manifested in unjust (and lethal) hostility that became 
increasingly prevalent as the samurai declined. </P>
<P>This social decline was due to the ultimate futility of their existence as 
their society began to morph into an increasingly accelerated tangent due to 
modernization and westernization, combined with hundreds of years of peace.</P>

<P><B><FONT color=#000080>BUKE&nbsp;HIERARCHY</FONT></B></P>
<P>The highest social rank for a buke to hold (below the <B>shogun</B>) was to 
be a <B>daimyo</B> or 'great name'. These were the provincial military governors 
famous for being patrons of an artistic and cultural explosion that occurred 
around 1600. </P>
<P>This year also marked the formative Battle of Sekigahara; the victors, led by 
<B>Tokugawa Ieyasu</B>, established a new shogunate and between 250-260 feudal 
governors, or daimyo. Daimyo existed in three basic forms: </P>
<UL>
  <LI><B>Shimpan</B> - "Related Lords" - Honorable family members
  <P></P>
  <LI><B>Fudai</B> - "Inner Lords" - Hereditary lords who controlled <B>Han</B> 
  (fiefs) and assisted bakufu policies
  <P></P>
  <LI><B>Tozama</B> - "Outer Lords" - Powerful lords who were indifferent or 
  hostile, and were dealt with carefully
  <P></P></LI></UL>
<P><B>Shimpan</B> lived close to the capital, which was now in Edo (modern-day 
Tokyo) and held significant offices in the civil government (though they lacked 
any real power).</P>
<P><B>Fudai</B> were the lords who had previously been vassals of the 
<B>Tokugawa</B> family before the pivotal Battle of <B>Sekigahara</B>; Tokugawa 
Ieyasu was the last of <B>the 3 Unifiers</B>, and the man who finally succeeded 
in establishing the new shogunate. Fudai <B>han</B> (fiefs) were essentially a 
living buffer that would encircle the central core under bakufu control; in 
return, <B>fudai</B> also occupied important positions in the government. </P>

<P><B>Tozama</B> were the remaining ujikami (clan chieftans) who were rivals of 
Ieyasu, and acknowledged his title of Shogun.</P>
<P>The arrival of the Americans in 1853 upset the delicate balance of threats 
that the bakufu maintained between <B>kuge</B> intrigue and <B>daimyo</B> 
uprisings. This then triggered the restoration of the Meiji Emperor in 1868, 
after 'revere the Emperor and expel the barbarians' became a popular 
catch-phrase.</P>
