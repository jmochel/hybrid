size=+1><B>CRAFTSMEN</B></FONT></P>
<P>In Edo society, craftsmen and merchants were socially ranked even below the 
farmers, with the merchants at the bottom solely because of the money they made 
off of others' efforts. Craftsmen were classified into 3 main types which were 
then sub-classified:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Those with their own shop
  <P></P>
  <LI>Those who arrive on-site to perform work
  <P></P>
  <LI>Wandering Craftsmen (which had individual ranks based on why they wander)
  <P></P></LI></UL>
<P>At this time (17th c.), the most money was typically made in one of the 'five 
crafts': roofer, sawyer, stonemason, plasterer, and carpenter. Those in the same 
trade lived together in a certain area of town, and paid their taxes as much in 
goods and services as in cash. Therefore, when the 1850's came around and feudal 
Japan was faced with the reality of the west already undergoing the industrial 
revolution, there was a level of craftsmanship unheard of outside of Asia.

width=276><FONT color=#000080 size=+1><B>MERCHANTS </B></FONT>
<P>The merchants were much-maligned by the civil government and grew more feared 
in correlation with their growing incomes, which in turn correlated with growing 
social influence. In a phenomenon similar to the Italian Renaissance, the 
capital generated by the merchants spawned a related culture. </P>
<P>Merchants dealt not in rice but in coin, and utilized four metals: gold 
(oban, koban, ichibu kin), silver (chogin, mame-ita, monme), copper (zeni), and 
iron. They had square holes in the center based on the Chinese system, and were 
carried on strings of hemp.</P>
<P>Like all other classes, merchants were strictly sub-classified but the 
critical difference was that they made up their own rules (compared to the other 
classes, who were defined by the military). Merchant dogma directed one to work 
dilligently and avoid things like the following:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Sponsoring charity wrestling tournaments
  <P></P>
  <LI>Trips to <B>Kyoto</B>
  <P></P>
  <LI>Sports, incense-discrimination, or poetry
  <P></P>
  <LI>Familiarity with <B>geisha</B> (prostitutes) and/or actors of the 
  <B>Kabuki</B> (lower-class)</B><FONT face=arial>variety
  <P></P>
  <LI>Lessons in <B>iaijutsu</B> (art of the quick draw) or sword-fighting
  <P></P></LI></UL>
<P>There is a particularly fascinating feudal development that relates to 
merchant culture: at roughly the same time as the northern Italians (and perhaps 
a bit earlier: 1400-1500s), money replaced rice as the primary means of exchange 
at Sakai, the merchant village established on foreign trade and not feudal 
relations.</P>

<P><FONT color=#000080 size=+1><B>THE RONIN</B></FONT> 
<P>To be <B>Ronin</B> (masterless) was not necessarily dishonorable to the 
individual; in fact, 'seven times down, eight times up' is a traditional 
anecdote describing how a lord would (periodically throughout a samurai's 
career) dispatch certain bushi on a year-long wandering mission. In the ranks of 
employed warriors, however, one without a master was a social outcast due to his 
personal autonomy, which was unheard-of in all strata of Japanese society. The 
Ronin, however, came to treasure his freedoms and found it possible to 
spiritually grow beyond the limitations he previously railed against.</P>
<P>The Ronin, then, are what represent the 'renaissance' fighting man in 
classical Japan. They were adventurers, seekers of psychological and physical 
challenge, and stood out in diametric contrast compared to the rigid 
stratification of Japanese society-at-large. They were men of great value, who 
had been socially ostracized due to the fickle zephyr that is politics. In 
groups, time and again they proved their effectiveness against the organized and 
centralized military government, the shogunate of <B>Tokugawa Ieyasu</B>, also 
known as the <B>Bakufu</B>. This system of military government ultimately 
outlasted the Ronin as a collective; nonetheless, there will always be a decided 
historical romanticism in the notion of the highly skilled, self-sufficient 
outcast who had to constantly defend himself against mastered samurai, who had 
the social wherewithal to be offended by the presence of the masterless 
warrior.</P>

<P><FONT color=#000080 size=+1><B>NINJA</B></FONT> 
<P>An entire course could be dedicated to this subject because ninja are so 
widely misunderstood. To put it concisely, the ninja performed the military 
tasks that were so socially maligned that no samurai or ostensible warrior could 
perform them. Such missions included sabotage, surveillance, assassinations, 
infiltration, et cetera. Ninja lived in extremely tight and secretive family 
organizations, and the finest secrets of their art are probably lost (or at 
least hidden from the lay eye).</P>
