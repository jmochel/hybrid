<H3>Tendo Ryu: One foot on the Battlefield, One in the Modern World</H3>
<P>Perhaps the best source to understand the role of martial training within Edo period society and in subsequent periods of Japanese history is the historical records and practices associated with one or another traditional <I>ryu ha. </I> Tendo Ryu <I>naginatajutsu</I>, in particular, embodies many of the most significant changes in martial training from the late sixteenth century to the present, including: a transition from a warrior's art, incorporating many weapons to a martial tradition with a decided emphasis on a single one; the increasing emphasis on the <I>naginata</I> as a weapon associated with women in most people's minds; the transition of martial arts as combative training to a training of will and spirit; the use of martial arts in mass education; and the development of sportive forms of martial training.</P>
<P>Tendo Ryu was developed sometime in the 1560's, a time of chaos and warfare.  The founder was Saito Denkibo Katsuhide. Some traditions state that he studied with Tsukahara Bokuden, the founder of the famous Kashima Shinto Ryu. Legends of this school assert that Saito went into retreat at a shrine in Kamakura where, after 100 days, he received the secrets of Tendo Ryu from a god during a dream. Another tradition is that, one night, he got into a fight with a mountain ascetic, curiously reminiscent of the Biblical tale of Jacob wrestling with the angel of the Lord. After a battle lasting until dawn, Saito asked his opponent his school's name. Saying nothing, the man walked away towards the sun. In a moment of inspiration, Saito realized the name to be Ten Ryu, "Heaven's Tradition." At a later period, some offshoots began to refer to their school as Tendo Ryu, "The Tradition of the Way of Heaven."</P>
<P>Among other things, this story is illustrative of the fact that an "enlightenment" experience does not necessarily endow an individual with any moral virtues. Saito remained a flamboyant, pugnacious man. In some accounts, he is described wearing a kimono of feathers/ or in imitation of feathers, as if he were a mountain <I> </I>demon (<I>tengu</I>). He fought many duels and was successful enough with his school to be awarded a prize from the Emperor. His last bout was at age 38. Some time after killing his opponent, he was ambushed by the dead man's followers, shooting arrows at him from several directions. Using a technique basic to the Tendo Ryu even today, he was able to knock down many of the arrows with his spear, but finally was killed, "as full of arrows as a hedgehog has quills" as one modern writer put it. Someone who supposedly saw the fight, reported the strength of this arrow blocking technique to Saito's son who became the next teacher of the school. Ten Ryu later became a significant school in many areas of <A NAME="footsix">Japan</A>.<SUP><A HREF="wwjnotes.html#endsix">6</A></SUP></P>
<P>Ten Ryu had a rather violent history during Edo period and quite a few of its members were involved in well-known duels with people from other <A NAME="footseven">schools</A>.<SUP><A HREF="wwjnotes.html#endseven">7</A></SUP></P>
<P>As time passed, changes were made in the teaching methods and focus of this system.  The oldest records of the school include instructions for the study of sword and numerous other weapons, as well as battlefield tactics, fighting on horseback, hand-to-hand combat and esoteric philosophical teachings.  Significant changes occurred, however, under the tenure of Mitamura Kengyo, headmaster of one line of Tendo Ryu, in the late 1800's, who singled out the naginata, particularly for the training of women and girls.</P>
<P>Mitamura helped organize the Seitokusha, a school of Shinto and martial arts practice, in a effort to combat the steady influx of Western influence. In 1895, his group merged with the Dai Nippon Butokukai, a national regulating body of martial arts. After displaying his methods for group teaching in 1899, he was contracted by the large Doshisha women's school in Kyoto to teach on a regular basis. It was after this time that the Tendo Ryu came to be known as specializing in the study of the <I>naginata</I>. Women took prominence as teachers (most notably, Mitamura's brilliant wife, Mitamura Chiyo), and the practice weapon was made <A NAME="footeight">lighter</A>.<SUP><A HREF="wwjnotes.html#endeight">8</A></SUP></P>
<P>There are 120 two-person forms (<I>kata</I>) surviving, featuring the <I>naginata</I>, sword, chain-and-sickle <I>(kusarigama)</I>, stick <I>(jo)</I>, two swords, and short sword (<I>kodachi</I>). The person in the teaching position in these forms is always armed with a sword. (This position is called <I>uketachi</I>, which literally means "receiving sword." From this point, <I>uketachi</I> will be referred to as "instructor." ) This role is always played by the teacher or higher ranking student. The instructor's function is to serve as "cooperative opposition" to the student, thereby enabling them to hone their skills.</P>
<P>The vast bulk of the forms feature the <I>naginata</I> in the learner's position. (The person in the learning role is called shitachi , which means "user's sword" From this point, <I>shitachi</I> will be referred to as "practitioner") . It is unclear when these forms were developed, although it is quite unusual for older martial systems<I> </I>to contain so many forms, particularly emphasizing a single weapon such as the <I>naginata</I>. It is thus a fair surmise that more and more forms were probably added over time, as practitioners attempted to add either their personal stamp or more sophistication to the curriculum of the school.</P>
<P>The techniques are first practiced singly and after a time, with a partner. A number of years ago, I observed the mid-summer practice at the Shubukan Dojo near Osaka, where practitioners from all over Japan gather to practice together. One of my enduring memories of this school was the sight of perhaps one hundred women, under the direction of current headmistress Mitamura Takeko, granddaughter of Mitamura Kengyo and Mitamura Chiyo, cutting and thrusting through their basic techniques in sweeping arcs of perfect unity.</P>
<P>The basic forms are a series of crisp, spiraling movements of the <I>naginata</I> against the sword. These <I>naginata</I> forms often utilize cuts to the wrist or underarm. <I>Ichi monji no midare</I>, the technique Saito Denkibo is said to have used to cut down arrows 400 years ago forms the basis for many <I>kata</I>.</P>
<P>Although Tendo Ryu was developed during a time of war, many of the actual techniques discovered at that time have been lost. In spite of this, the people who practice Tendo Ryu today have been able to maintain a large part of the spirit and frame of reference of those times. The <I>kata</I> are practiced to instill a sense of fighting awareness. Mitamura Takeko calls it the "cut and thrust spirit." She believes that practicing in this way can help one to reach deep inside oneself. "I don't just practice the <I>naginata</I>, it is a part of me." She states that even though a student practices killing, "the gentleness and softness inherent in a woman is not lost. In fact, the training is aimed at focusing those traits into a strength which can be used for fostering and protecting as well as taking life."</P>
<P>The instructor usually initiates the <I>kata</I>, maintaining a spacing perhaps one half step outside that which would be appropriate to strike the practitioner. The Tendo Ryu found this necessary because otherwise, either trainee might easily be injured, and the <I>naginata's</I> movements may become cramped and abbreviated as they tried to safely accommodate their cuts so as not to strike the instructor standing within range. Thus, Tendo Ryu's forms are geared to the development of the <I>naginata's</I> technique, allowing the practitioner to cut with full power and extension.</P>
<P>The instructor's intention, while trying to draw and lead the <I>naginata, </I>is by no means passive. The teachers constantly remind both sides to attack, not receive. There are two main <I>kiai,</I> (use of the voice and breath to create or foster certain feelings or reactions in oneself or one's opponents), one for calling or pulling your opponent toward you (TOH!), and the deciding <I>kiai</I>. This final <I>kiai</I> is executed in two ways; a short forceful "EH!" to accompany and strengthen cuts, and a piercing "spiraling" manner "Eeeehhh!" to enhance thrusts. Smoothness of breath, and the maintenance of postural integrity while breathing deeply is emphasized.</P>
<P>Some of the <I>kata</I> are very realistic about the limitations of the <I>naginata</I> . They feature the <I>naginata</I> and short sword to combat a sword. Since the <I>naginata</I> is not very effective in close fighting, it is thrown aside as the sword fighter gets inside it's arc. The short sword is quickly drawn and used to stab the swordfighter. This type of form harkens back to two sources: combat grappling (<I>kumiuchi</I>), in which fighters would use small weapons on the belt (called <I>koshi no mawari</I>  {literally - "around the hips"}or <I>kogusoku </I>{literally - "light armor"}) and the use of the dagger by women fighting an opponent who attempted to use his greater mass and skill at close combat to overwhelm her.</P>
<P>Some of the senior practitioners still train in the other weapons of the school. These include techniques with the chain-and-sickle, a five foot staff, which simulates the haft of a <I>naginata </I>with the blade broken off<I>, </I>and some very intriguing forms featuring two swords.</P>
<P>Tendo Ryu's main <I>dojo</I> is the Shubukan in Osaka, but there are powerful groups in many other areas of Japan. The members, almost all women, ranging from slender and young to stout and old, are not exceedingly formal. There is much laughter, affection and love. But during the practice of the <I>kata</I>, there is a sharpness and a focus found in few <I>dojos. </I>anywhere.<I> </I>Unlike some schools, which claim to have remained largely unchanged since their inception, it is likely that Tendo Ryu is far different than the original Ten Ryu practiced by the wild Saito Denkibo Katsuhide. Nonetheless, perhaps the best of his spirit still resides in the hands and hearts of the women of Tendo Ryu, a courage and integrity in movement anyone would do well to emulate.</P>
