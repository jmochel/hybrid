Megacorps

What are mega-corps ? What are my models ?

Fundamentally I have in my head a mixture of E.E. Doc Smiths "Subspace Explorers" 
Interstellar corporations, the kaibatsu and Robocop's evil corporation.

Nothin really new there but I would actually like to come up with some idea of how it 
would all work. 

How does the Confed keep corporations in check ? They are, after all, legal entities with 
representation on the council. One answer is the MI. And it is a realistic response in many 
situations. Very few worlds exhibit a lot of sympathy for a mega-corp that has gotten its 
hand slapped.  

What are they like ? Semi-feudal in many situations. Semi-autonomous as well.
To all intents and purposes a Mega-corp is a semi-totalitarian government that makes a profit.
(Ahhh the Republican ideal.) 

I have some ideas of what some of the companies are:

GMHD (Computers/Military/Biomed/Artifacts)
Interstellar (mining)
Galactic Metals aka GalMet (Mining)
Silverstone (Electronics/Computers)
Apple-Cray (Computers/Software) 
Warner Media (News)
Habideem (Spacecraft - non military)
Mohawk Power (Field Engineering/Power generation) 
Stellar Engineering (engineering automation/nanotech)
Mushima Star (rare metals mining/composites/material technology)
MARScience  (originally MARS Science Labs ) (cyberlinks/cyber enhancements)


Other suggestions ?
