   Hi all!

   I just discovered this newsgroup a little while ago.  It's a breath of
   fresh air.

   If anyone's interested, I have my own future history on-line, at
   <http://www.geocities.com/jiawen6/history.html>.  It's still rather
   unfinished, but I'd definitely appreciate comments and ideas from anyone
   on this list.  Please check it out.

   (Oh, I suppose I should give a little introduction to it.  It's
   basically for an RPG I'm designing, although the background consumes far
   more of my time than the system itself.  The future I'm working towards
   is one in which humanity has settled a rough sphere of about 50 LY from
   Sol; the date I'm working towards is 2221 A.D.  I'm trying to make it
   very realistic and plausible, save for the inclusion of FTL technology.
   In any case, please check it out.)

   I've checked it and bookmarked it.

   I think you're starting it too close to the present; but you can always
   consider it an alternate history, if too many things go "wrong".

   It's a bit close, that's true.  I guess the reason I did so was to make
   it as realistic as possible.  Also, the joy of electronic publishing is
   that I can change it any time I want to (until it becomes a paper
   publication, which I doubt will ever happen), especially when something
   I predicted becomes unlikely, uninteresting or just plain actually
   happens.

   By the way, I notice on your site that you're from Muplis.  Me, too!  (I
   haven't lived there for about ten years, but I still consider it my
   "home.")  Nifty!

   Anyway, please keep me up to date with any further ideas you may have,
   and thanks for the comments.

   So long as it can be changed easily....  There were a bunch of novels
   about future conflict between the US and USSR which came out for a few
   months after the Soviet Union fell apart.

   I don't consider myself "from" here; I'm from the Catskills.  But the Twin
   Cities is definitely home, now.

   Where in Minneapolis did you live?  And where do you live now?

   hi I've just looked through your history and was impressed.

   A couple of issues I'm interested in, being from New Zealand myself:

       you seem to have neglected the dissolution of the british commonwealth,
   which I would think would be necessary before some of your events take
   place.

       I was interested in why you chose to split NZ north & south rather than
   the more obvious racial split Mäori & Pakeha.  & how that vote would be
   considered unconstitutional when NZ has no formal constitution.

       oh and the aboriginal thing in Australia - I think the northern
   territories would be more likely than queensland, being as Qland's a state &
   NT isn't

   oh & india vs pakistan needs to be addressed.

   but in general I liked it, & hope you treat these comments as questions
   rather than criticism & that you may even take the time to discuss your
   reasoning with me.

   Do you think its dissolution is really necessary?  It feels to me like
   the Commonwealth has gone the way of the Royals -- vaguely respected,
   given lip service but effectively a thing of the past.  Or maybe the
   links among Commonwealth members are stronger than I thought?

   >

   About the Maori/Pakeha thing -- I guess like I felt I was already using
   racial conflict in the US, and because in my view, New Zealand is doing
   a much better job of addressing the problem than the US is.  I think I
   can see NZ getting Maori people more-or-less equal within a century or
   so.  Again, I may be vastly wrong about this.  To be honest, I know
   dreadfully little about New Zealand.  However, I thought I saw something
   somewhere about the economic disparity between North and South, and how
   that was causing grumbling.  Could be wrong.

   I honestly didn't know that NZ doesn't have a constitution.  However,
   this is something I would guess would happen within a century or so
   (that is, that New Zealanders would choose to enact a constitution
   within 100 years or so).  But I may need to change that...  

   >     oh and the aboriginal thing in Australia - I think the northern
   > territories would be more likely than queensland, being as Qland's a state

   Again, a very good point.  I'll think about it...  (Although I think
   aboriginal people might very well demand Queensland, knowing full-well
   that it's much more valuable than the NT -- or were you talking about
   governmental structure as being the reason the NT would be more likely
   to be granted?)

   > oh & india vs pakistan needs to be addressed.
   >

   Basically, Pakistan officially (i.e., via UN/LSN recognition) gets
   everything it considers its own already, when India splits up
   (balkanization, 2040's).  But you're right, I didn't actually write it
   out in the history itself.  Will do so soon...

   Thank you for your comments.  They're actually quite helpful.  Please
   tell me what you think (and everybody else pipe in, too!).

   both here and in Australia the move towards becoming a republic comes up
   every so often & does get some people riled up.  it will probably just take
   time, but longer than you leave before your north/south tension.  & if
   people are unwilling to abandon England I think they'd be even more
   reluctant to split the country

   fair enough.  I think greater ties with australia are just as likely though.
   & we're too mobile & homogenous to split (or seriously consider it) as soon
   as you predict, push it back by 50 years & it may be more likely

   the South island free trade zone you talk about may need a little
   researching.  current govt policy would have the whole country be something
   apporaching this by the time you put this.  true this is subject to those
   policies continuing for years, but with a MMP parlimentary system it is
   likely that some members of the present govt will form part of most

   I found your timeline interesting...

   Perhaps a little more detail involving the formation of the AAS might be in
   order....I would assume that the U.S.
   was in deep economic decline from (approx) 2010 on, perhaps starting with
   the L.A. quake in 2016....

   Unfortunately,  I think that if a series of disasters like that were to
   occur, there would be enough desperate
   people in the U.S. to make something like the AAS a reality...

   I look forward to reading more...

   That's one impressive timeline you've got there.

   Being a Swede I got interested in the Lapp (Sami) nationalist movement -
   which only got one or rather two lines (independence in the end) in the
   story. In light of the population explosion I find it rather unlikely
   that Sweden would grant independence to Lappland, a region that
   constitutes 27% of Sweden. The Lapps (Samis) number somewhere
   between 15,000 and 20,000 today and are only in majority in isolated
   pockets in the mountains. If the Sami would continue their reindeer
   herding within their _own_ territory not many hundreds would be able to
   support themselves. If the Samis migrated to the north of Sweden
   instead, to the Kiruna municipaly (5% of Sweden, comparable with 1/2 of
   Switzerlands area) where they already are 11%, I'd see the independence
   movement as more credible. The Kiruna region also happens to be the
   centre for the Swedish Space Corporation.

   Just constructive criticism :)

   The following are simply things that I noticed about your timeline, or
   points of my own.  Please don't take them harshly; they're merely
   suggestions.

   -- In the 2000s, you note an increase in Basque resistance after Spain
   joins the EU.  Spain is currently a member-state of the EU.

   -- Kurdistan is given sovereignty from Iraq and begins to liberate
   their fellow Kurds from Turkey.  What about Kurds in Iran or Syria?

   -- Peace is reached in Northern Ireland, which gains sovereignty.
   Whilst it is certainly possible that Northern Ireland could gain
   _autonomy_, its culture (IMO) is tied too closely to both the UK and
   Eire for it to become a sovereign state; it's sort of like granting
   sovereignty to the West Bank.  Northern Ireland is more likely to
   either remain as an autonomous member of the UK, or be absorbed by its
   southern neighbour.  With sufficient social reform in Eire, and if
   handled carefully, the latter possibility might occur with little
   bloodshed.

   -- In the 2010s, Quebec secedes from Canada and the maritime provinces
   form their own republic.  Admittedly, I'm no expert in Canadian
   internal politics, but I don't think that the maritimes would
   themselves secede so easily.  Should the Inuit claims to territory in
   Quebec succeed (and the Inuit choose to remain a part of Canada, a
   fairly likely possibility), there may even be a land corridor linking
   the two parts of Canada.  On the outside, should the US fragment, it's
   possible that they might join a "New England Republic" (admittedly,
   it's a long shot), but I don't really see them as a republic in their
   own right.

   -- Italy dissolves into ten independent states.  Should Italy dissolve
   (a not entirely unlikely possibility), I see it as splitting into
   perhaps three or four states at most -- a state in the northwest
   (centred on Milan), one in the northeast (centred on Venice), another
