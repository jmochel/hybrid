<h2>
Introduction</h2>
<b><i>Please read &#147;<a href="james.htm">A Word from the President</a>&#148; 
to learn more about the educational rationale we followed in creating this index.</i></b> 
<p>Annually Watchman Fellowship publishes an index issue of the <i>Watchman Expositor</i>. 
  The 2000 Index contains brief definitions, descriptions or cross references 
  on over 1,200 religious organizations and beliefs. This year&#146;s index is 
  expanded to include world religions (including Christianity) and related doctrines. 
  Watchman Fellowship is a Christian apologetics and discernment ministry (please 
  see <a href="about.htm">Publication Information</a>). Thus, many references 
  (&#147;Jesus,&#148; &#147;Gospel,&#148; &#147;Christianity,&#148; etc.) contain 
  definitions that reflect the beliefs of Watchman&#146;s staff. While Watchman 
  Fellowship does not hold to the beliefs of non-Christian religions and doctrines, 
  we also attempt to describe these beliefs factually, fairly and accurately. 
  Readers are asked to assist in this effort by suggesting corrections or improvements 
  (please read <a href="james.htm">A Word from the President</a>). 
<p>This is by no means a complete list of cults and religions. Watchman
Fellowship maintains over 10,000 files and a research library of over 25,000
books and periodicals on religions, cults, new religious movements and
related teachings. The absence of a religious movement from this index
does not mean that Watchman Fellowship endorses the organization.

<h3>
Some Definitions</h3>
By using the terms &#147;cult,&#148; &#147;occult,&#148; and &#147;New Age,&#148; 
Watchman Fellowship is in no way implying that the followers or leaders are necessarily 
evil or immoral people. It simply means that such groups seem to promote doctrine 
or practices which may be considered outside the realm of historic Christianity. 
<br>
<a NAME="Cult"></a>
<h4>
Cult</h4>
By its primary dictionary definition, the term cult just means a system of religious 
beliefs or rituals. It is based on a farming term in Latin meaning cultivation. 
Sociologists and anthropologists sometimes use the term cult to describe religious 
structure or belief patterns with meanings (usually non-pejorative) unique to 
their disciplines. In modern usage, the term cult is often used by the general 
public to describe any religious group they view as strange or dangerous. Thus, 
cult can describe religious leaders or organizations that employ abusive, manipulative, 
or illegal control over their followers&#146; lives. In addition to these usages, 
Christians generally have a doctrinal component to their use of the word. Cult 
in this sense, is a counterfeit or serious deviation from the doctrines of classical 
Christianity. Watchman Fellowship usually uses the term cult with a Christian 
or doctrinal definition in mind. In most cases the group claims to be Christian, 
but because of their aberrant beliefs on central doctrines of the faith (God, 
Jesus, and salvation), the organization is not considered by Watchman Fellowship 
to be part of orthodox, biblical Christianity. <a href="cults/index.htm">Research 
material</a> and <i><a href="profile/patrnpro.htm">Profile</a></i> are available. 
<br>
<a name="Occult"></a> 
<h4>
Occult</h4>
The term, &#147;occult&#148; comes from the Latin <i>occultus</i> or &#147;hidden.&#148; 
Generally the word is used of secret or mysterious supernatural powers or magical, 
religious rituals. The word &#147;occult&#148; in this publication is used to 
describe any attempt to gain supernatural power or knowledge apart from the God 
of the Bible. Generally it refers to <a href="#Wicca">witchcraft</a>, <a href="#Satanism">satanism</a>, 
<a href="#Neopagan">neo-paganism</a>, or various forms of Psychic discernment 
(astrology, seances, palm reading, etc.). <a href="occult/index.htm">Research material</a> 
available. 
<p><a NAME="New Age"></a><b>New Age</b>
<br>
  &nbsp;
<p>New Age is a recent and developing belief system in North America encompassing 
  thousands of autonomous (and sometime contradictory) beliefs, organizations, 
  and events. Generally the New Age borrows its theology from pantheistic Eastern 
  religions and its practices from 19th century Western occultism. The term &#147;New 
  Age&#148; is used herein as an umbrella term to describe organizations which 
  seem to exhibit one or more of the following beliefs: (1) All is one, all reality 
  is part of the whole; (2) Everything is God and God is everything; (3) Man is 
  God or a part of God; (4) Man never dies, but continues to live through reincarnation; 
  (5) Man can create his own reality and/or values through transformed consciousness 
  or altered states of consciousness. <a href="na/index.htm">Research material</a>

<p><a name="Adventism"></a><b>Adventism:</b> Widespread trans-denominational movement 
  inspired by William Miller's prediction that Jesus' "advent" (return) would 
  take place in 1844. Even after the Great Disappointment (the date's failure), 
  many people in the movement continued to believe. Some suggested revised chronologies 
  and new dates, eventually forming groups such as the <a href="#Watchtower">Watchtower 
  Bible and Tract Society</a>. Others, notably Hiram Edson and Ellen G. White, 
  suggested that the 1844 date was accurate but that a heavenly (thus invisible) 
  event had taken place. Their teachings became the basis of <a href="#SDA">Seventh-day 
  Adventism</a>, which eventually spawned its own offshoots, including <a href="#Armstrongism">Armstrongism</a> 
  and the <a href="#Davidians">Branch Davidians</a>. 
<p><b>Aesthetic Realism Foundation,</b> Eli Seigel, New York: Happiness
can be achieved through the harmony of opposites, e.g., realizing and accepting
that the world is both beautiful and horrific (see <a href="#Taoism">Taoism</a>).

art courses.

<p><b>Affective Education:</b> Also called value-free, or non-directive,
education. Influenced by the philosophy of Carl Rogers, affective education
programs attempt to facilitate the emotional development of children in
order to enhance the learning process, particularly focusing on self-esteem.
This contrasts with traditional educational paradigms that focus on cognitive,
or intellectual, practices such as reading, writing, and arithmetic. Affective
education has become particularly influential in drug awareness programs
for youth.

<p><b>Agnosticism:</b> The claim (denied by Romans 1:18&#150;20) that one has 
  no knowledge of God or the origin of the universe. Some agnostics make the claim 
  on a personal level, while allowing that such knowledge may exist but has never 
  been known by themselves. Others assert that such knowledge cannot be had by 
  anyone. Agnostics avoid the charge of <i>dogmatic <a href="#Atheism">atheism</a></i> 
  by acknowledging the theoretical possibility of God&#146;s existence. Yet virtually 
  all live as if the non-existence of God was an established fact, and are thus 
  <i>practical atheists</i>.

<p><a NAME="BaptReg"></a><b>Baptismal Regeneration:</b> The belief that regeneration 
  (i.e., the new birth), and therefore salvation or eternal life, is conditioned 
  upon water baptism. Most groups teaching this doctrine also add that proper 
  mode (immersion or sprinkling) and/or proper minister (one authorized by the 
  organization) is necessary. All Christians should be baptized (Matthew 28:19). 
  The teaching that baptism is a prerequisite for salvation, however, is considered 
  by many evangelicals to be a heretical compromise of the biblical gospel of 
  salvation by grace alone (Ephesians 2:8-10). The extreme version of baptismal 
  regeneration, which denies the salvation even of baptized Christians outside 
  some particular church group, is clearly heretical. See <a href="#SavWorks">Salvation

<p><a NAME="Celt"></a><b>Celticism, Celts:</b> The Celts were a group of related 
  tribes whose territory extended throughout Europe early in the first millennium 
  <font size="2"> AD</font>, but who are most commonly associated with the British 
  Isles. The Celts worshipped local deities (frequently associated with nature), 
  often served by a priestly class of <a href="#Druid">Druids</a>. Human sacrifice 
  was important to Druidic religion. Modern <a href="#Neopagan">neo-pagans</a> 
  frequently claims to be Celtic, although the modern beliefs and practices bear 
  little resemblance to ancient Celticism. 
<p><b>Celtic Christianity:</b> Augustine of Canterbury evangelized England in 
  the late 6th  early 7th centuries. His work was later taken by Patrick to Ireland, 
  who is largely credited with establishing the Celtic church. Celtic Christianity 
  was heavily influenced by the Roman Catholic Church, to which it was allied, 
  although many individuals claim a greater reverence for nature in the Celtic 
  tradition. Differences in practice within the Celtic church were gradually eradicated 
  during the Middle Ages as the Roman papacy asserted its authority over Ireland. 
  Modern groups that claim to revive Celtic Christianity are frequently a mixture 
  of <a href="#Protestantism">Protestantism</a> and <a href="#Roman">Roman Catholicism</a>, 
  with few legitimate ties to the early Celtic church. Nonetheless, these groups 
  should not be confused with <a href="#Neopagan">neo-pagan</a> groups that also

<p><a name="Christ"></a><b>Christ:</b> Based on the Greek <i>christos</i> meaning 
  &#147;anointed one,&#148; equivalent to the Hebrew &#147;messiah.&#148; Generally 
  used in the Old Testament of one who has been anointed with oil and/or set apart 
  for a specific mission, as was David, the king of Israel (see 1 Sam. 16:13). 
  Specifically used to speak of the promised messiah/savior of Israel and the 
  world. Christians believe this to be <a href="#Jesus">Jesus</a> of Nazareth, 
  who died to atone for human sin. Other religions believe in a succession of 
  Christ figures through history, sometimes including Jesus, who were great teachers. 
  New Age groups sometimes understand the term &#147;Christ&#148; as a reference 
  to the deity found in all humanity (the Cosmic Christ). Thus, Jesus was conscious 
  of his deity or &#147;the Christ within&#148; and others can have this same 
  &#147;<a href="#ChristCon">Christ-consciousness</a>&#148; by realizing that 
  they, too, are divine. Other religious leaders have historically claimed to 
  hold the office or ministry of Christ including <a href="#Unification">Unification 
  Church</a> founder Rev. Sun Myung Moon. Biblical warnings are given for &#147;false 
  Christs&#148; (Mark 13:22). Scripture also speaks of an antichrist and of antichrists 
  who stand against and/or instead of the true Christ (1 John 2:18).

  Followers, called Christians, were initially viewed as a sect of <a href="#Judaism">Judaism</a>. 
  It quickly developed as a separate religion as Jewish Christians became outnumbered

  became a diverse worldwide movement. Their scripture is the Bible, which contains 
  the Jewish Scriptures (Old Testament) and the Christian Scriptures (New Testament). 
  Except for <a href="#Cult">cults</a>, aberrant sects, and <a href="#LibChrist">Liberal

  Human beings are sinners who (without the grace of God received through faith

  Joseph Smith, Salt Lake City, UT: (Latter-day Saints, LDS, Mormonism) Main body 
  of Mormonism; recognizes Brigham Young as Smith&#146;s successor. Smith claimed 
  that the Father and Son appeared to him and called him to restore the true Church. 
  LDS Church teaches that God the Father was once a man and was exalted to Godhood. 
  God (and his heavenly Wife) begat billions of spirit children, the firstborn 
  of whom was Jesus. Lucifer was the leader of God&#146;s rebellious spirit children. 
  Those spirits who did not rebel become human beings in order to begin process 
  potentially leading to exaltation to Godhood. Jesus, however, became a God while 
  only a spirit. He organized our world and is Jehovah, the God of Israel. He 
  is a separate and subordinate God to Elohim, the Father. A distinction is made 
  between the Holy Ghost, who is a personage of Spirit, and the Holy Spirit. The 
  latter is a divine energy, force, or spiritual essence that fills the universe 
  and is used by all three members of the Godhead in the exercise and accomplishment 
  of their will. The Church rejects the orthodox doctrine of the <a href="#Trinity">Trinity</a>. 
  It also redefines <a href="#SavGrace">salvation by grace</a> to refer simply 
  to resurrection. Almost all humans will be resurrected into one of three kingdoms 
  of glory, the least of which is far superior to anything known in this life. 
  Entry into the higher kingdoms, and one&#146;s rank there, depends not only 
  upon the atonement of Christ, but also upon one&#146;s good works. Achievement 
  of the highest potential within the highest kingdom&#151;Godhood&#151;requires 
  complete &#147;obedience to all the laws and ordinances of the gospel.&#148;

  though presently imprisoned by matter, energy, space, and time (MEST). Salvation 
  is the recovery of spiritual freedom, ability, independence and serenity, including 
  freedom from the endless cycle of birth and death (reincarnation), and full 
  awareness and ability independent of the body, i.e., being &#147;able to control 
  matter, energy, space, and time.&#148; These god-like powers are achieved through 
  auditing, a process whereby &#147;engrams,&#148; (the mental recordings of past 
  moments of pain and unconsciousness), and other barriers to such states are 
  removed, abilities are regained, and greater awareness achieved. Auditing can 
  last for years and may cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. Teachings are

<p><a NAME="Freemasonry"></a><b>Freemasonry:</b> A fraternal order revived in 
  the early 18th century in England, loosely based on associations or guilds of 
  stone cutters (&#147;operative&#148; masons). Freemasonry (&#147;speculative&#148; 
  masons) sought to give philosophical, moral, or spiritual meaning to the lodge, 
  tools, and oaths of the stone cutters. Branches of Freemasonry include the Blue 
  Lodge, York Rite, Scottish Rite, and Shriners. Affiliated organizations include 
  the Order of the Eastern Star (for women), the Order of DeMolay (for boys), 
  and the Order of Rainbow (for girls). Most modern adherents maintain that the 
  organization is not a religion but a club or fraternity promoting high moral 
  values and good works. They believe, therefore, that Freemasonry is compatible 
  with and supplements Christianity and other religions. Critics counter that 
  Freemasonry involves secret blood oaths or curses, and that the writings of 
  respected early leaders (Albert Mackey, Albert Pike, etc.) are replete with 
  occult philosophy and religious doctrine contrary to Christianity. Despite Freemasonry&#146;s 
  promotion and funding of a number of worthwhile, philanthropic endeavors (free 
  Shriner children hospitals, nursing homes, etc.), many Christian individuals 
  and churches have condemned Freemasonry or warned of elements that they believe 
  are contrary to Christianity. These churches include the Presbyterian Church 
  of America, Southern Baptist Convention, Episcopal Church, Christian Reformed 
  Church, Church of the Nazarene, and Lutheran Church (Missouri and Wisconsin 
  Synods).

<p><a NAME="FundChrist"></a><b>Fundamentalist Christianity:</b> Generally a reference 
  to conservative Christians who believe five &#147;fundamentals&#148; of <a href="#Christianity">Christianity</a>: 
  the inerrancy of Scripture, the virgin birth of Christ, the substitutionary 
  atonement of Christ, the bodily resurrection of Christ, and the historicity 
  of biblical miracles. More specifically, the term is identified with the conservative 
  reaction, especially in America, to <a href="#LibChrist">liberal Christianity</a> 
  in the early 20th century. Core beliefs of the movement are virtually identical 
  with <a href="#EvanChrist">evangelical Christianity</a>. Some fundamentalists, 
  however, later distinguished themselves from evangelicals (or neo-evangelicals) 
  whom they saw as too compromising and ecumenical. More recently some have given 
  a new, negative meaning to the term &#147;fundamentalist&#148; using it as a 
  synonym for narrow-minded, bigoted, anti-intellectual or divisive Christians.

<p><b><a name="Investigative Judgment"></a>Investigative Judgment:</b> One of 
  the unique doctrines of the <a href="#SDA">Seventh-day Adventist Church</a> 
  that make the place of that church within <a href="#EvanChrist">evangelical 
  Christianity</a> questionable. First taught in <a href="#Adventism">Adventism</a> 
  by Hiram Edson, F.B. Hahn, and O.R.L. Crosier, it was accepted as &#147;present 
  truth&#148; by those who would later become known as <a href="#SDA">Seventh-day 
  Adventists (SDAs)</a> after it was confirmed and taught in visions received 
  by Ellen G. White. The doctrine teaches that in the Holy of Holies in the Heavenly 
  Sanctuary Christ is now conducting an investigation into the lives of all who 
  have ever professed belief in Christ. He is judging all their works, by the 
  standard of God&#146;s Law. All those whose lives fail to measure up to the 
  standard of the Law are rejected and condemned as not having true faith. Those 
  whose lives meet that standard and thus manifest the perfect character and righteousness 
  of Christ are recognized as having true faith, and so their sins are &#147;blotted 
  out.&#148; SDAs say, &#147;This judgment vindicates the justice of God in saving 
  those who believe in Jesus. It declares that those who have remained loyal to 
  God shall receive the kingdom.&#148; Evangelicals believe, and the Bible teaches 
  (Rom. 3:21&#150;26), that God&#146;s justice in saving sinners who trust Jesus 
  to save them is vindicated by the blood of Jesus&#151;His death in their place, 
  in their behalf. <a href="profile/sdapro.htm"><i>Profile</i></a> (on SDA) available.

<p><a NAME="Islam"></a><b>Islam,</b> Muhammad: Based on the teachings and life 
  of Muhammad (570-632 AD) in Mecca and Medina, Saudi Arabia (then Persia). Islam 
  is the second largest world religion, and has recently become the third largest 
  religious body in America with over 6 million adherents. Muslim-based sects 
  such as the <a href="#NatIslam">Nation of Islam</a> (which appeals especially 
  to African-Americans) and <a href="#Bahai">Bah&aacute;&#146;&iacute;</a> (which 
  proclaims the unity of the human race) have special appeal to many Americans. 
  Islam is composed of two major divisions &#151; the mainstream Sunni (the largest) 
  and the more radical Shi&#146;ites. The mystical tradition of <a href="#Sufism">Sufism</a> 
  includes many Sunnis and some Shi&#146;ites. The Arabic word <i>Islam</i> means 
  &#147;submission to the will of God&#148; and a person who submits is called 
  a Muslim. The Qur&#146;an (or, Koran), the Torah, the Psalms of the Old Testament, 
  and the Gospel of the New Testament are regarded as holy books. However, only 
  the Qur&#146;an is considered uncorrupted. Islam rejects the <a href="#Trinity">Trinity</a> 
  doctrine, the deity of <a href="#Christ">Christ</a> and His Sonship, claiming 
  that <a href="#Jesus">Jesus</a> was only a great prophet. Muhammad is considered 
  to be the greatest prophet, whose coming was allegedly predicted by Christ. 
  Islam adheres fiercely to monotheism. In addition to good works, salvation is 
  sought though observance of the Five Pillars: reciting &#147;there is no God 
  but Allah and Muhammad is His Messenger,&#148; praying five times per day, fasting, 
  giving alms (donations to the poor), and a pilgrimage to Mecca. Historically, 
  Islam experienced tremendous growth often by forced proselytism &#151; unbelievers 
  (infidels) were offered conversion or death. While many Muslims exhibit tolerance 
  towards other faiths, even today Islamic fundamentalism promotes <i>jihad</i> 
  (holy war), against those of other religious and political views.

  Christian belief that Jesus is the second Person of the <a href="#Trinity">Trinity</a>, 
  that he was and is fully God and fully man, that he was born of a virgin, died

<p><a NAME="Judaism"></a><b>Judaism:</b> World religion that traces its origins 
  to God&#146;s call to Abram (Abraham) to be the father of a great people who 
  would inherit the land of Canaan and be the means of blessing to all mankind 
  (Genesis 12). That people is identified as the children of Abraham&#146;s grandson 
  Jacob, who was renamed Israel. The foundation of Judaism is the Torah (Genesis 
  through Deuteronomy), which tells of the Israelites&#146; bondage in Egypt, 
  their miraculous deliverance in the Exodus, and the giving of the Law through 
  Moses. The Israelites returned to the promised land of Canaan and became a small 
  but powerful nation there under the rule of King David and his son Solomon. 
  After Solomon&#146;s death the kingdom split into a northern kingdom called 
  Israel and a southern kingdom called Judah (the name of David&#146;s tribe). 
  The northern kingdom was conquered and decimated by the Assyrians in 722 BC, 
  after which the term Judeans, or Jews, gradually came into use to refer to all 
  Israelites. The Jews suffered conquests by a succession of foreign powers &#151; 
  the Babylonians, Persians, Greeks, and finally the Romans in the first century 
  BC. Throughout this period the Jews developed a strong sense of national identity, 
  identification with the Promised Land, and anticipation of a coming Messiah 
  or <a href="#Christ">Christ</a> (&#147;Anointed One&#148;). These themes dominate 
  the rest of the Jewish Bible, which is identical with the Protestant canon of 
  the Old Testament. In the first century AD, <a href="#Christianity">Christianity</a> 
  originated with the belief that <a href="#Jesus">Jesus</a> was that promised 
  Messiah. The Jewish establishment at that time, however, rejected Jesus&#146; 
  claim to be the Messiah, and in fulfillment of his prophecy (Mark 13) the Jerusalem 
  temple was destroyed and the Jewish nation scattered (AD 70). What is now known 
  as the religion of Judaism originated after AD 70 as the rabbis, or teachers 
  of the Torah, developed a system of laws and interpretations of the Torah that 
  were eventually codified in the Talmud. Today Judaism can be identified as a 
  cultural, ethnic, or religious concept. There are three main branches of modern 
  Judaism: Orthodox (traditional, literal adherence to the Torah as interpreted 
  by the Talmud), Conservative (a middle position advocating traditional beliefs 
  and practices up to a point), and Reform (liberal, non-literal stance on the 
  Torah and Talmud; often non-religious or secular with emphasis on Jewish culture).

  while discounting the infallible authority of the Bible. Its origins are in 
  the German Enlightenment, notably in the philosophy of Immanuel Kant and the 
  religious views of Friedrich Schleiermacher. Liberals reject the stated authorship 
  and historical accuracy of many books of the Bible. They are skeptical concerning 
  many or all of the biblical miracles, preferring naturalistic explanations or 
  viewing miracle accounts as legend or myth. They often deny or reinterpret in 
  mythical terms such doctrines of <a href="#OrthChrist">orthodox Christianity</a> 
  as the virgin birth, atoning death, and even the resurrection of <a href="#Jesus">Jesus</a>.

<p><a NAME="Local&quot;" Church></a><b>Local Church, The,</b> Watchman Nee, Anaheim,

  (Watchman Nee). Growth and controversy developed during the administration of 
  their second leader, the late Witness Lee, who moved to America in 1962 founding 
  Living Stream Ministry. Among issues drawing criticism from <a href="#EvanChrist">evangelical 
  Christians</a> is the Local Church's use of the term &#147;mingling&#148; to 
  describe the relationship between God and believers (i.e., Christians become 
  both divine and human like <a href="#Jesus">Jesus</a>). Some evangelicals have 
  also charged that the church compromises the <a href="#Trinity">Trinity</a> 
  doctrine by confusing the Persons of the Holy Spirit and the Son in a way similar 
  to <a href="#Modalism">modalism</a>. The organization's exclusivity has also 
  comme under fire. According to Lee, each city can and should have only one church. 
  Denominationalism is seen as of the Devil. According to critics, the effect 
  is that Lee-led local churches, usually called by the name of their cities (e.g., 
  the Church in Anaheim or the Church in Chicago), become the only true expressions 
  of the Body of Christ. Thus, according to former members, all other churches 
  or denominations are seen as being outside the will of God or not true churches 
  at all. The Local Church has also gained a reputation for threatening legal 
  action to prevent unfavorable public evaluation of its movement. Even Christian 
  critics have been targeted, adding to the evidence that they do not consider 
  believers outside their movement to be true or obedient Christians (1 Corinthians 
  6:1&#150;8).

<p><a name="Marxism"></a><b>Marxism/Leninism,</b> Karl Marx, Frederick Engels, 
  V.I. Lenin: Atheistic philosophy of communism based on the &#147;class struggle&#148; 
  theory of socioeconomic evolution derived from dialectic materialism. Sometimes 
  confused by the uninformed with biblical mandates to care for the poor, and 
  the voluntary sharing of resources practiced by some primitive Christians. Marxism 
  advocates establishment of a classless, stateless society by revolutionary force; 
  it has always led, however, to totalitarian statism, and has never successfully 
  eliminated any class but the <i>bourgeoisie,</i> the middle class, leaving the 
  great majority of its subjects in poverty. It is militantly atheistic. Marx 
  wrote, &#147;The criticism of religion ends with the teaching that man is the 
  highest being for man&#148; He contended that man &#147;looked for a superhuman 
  being in the fantastic reality of heaven and found nothing there but the reflection 
  of himself.&#148; Wrote Engels, &#147;we have once and for all declared war 
  on religion and religious ideas and care little whether we are called atheists 
  or anything else.&#148; Citing Marx and Engels as his authorities, Lenin declared 
  that &#147;the philosophical basis of Marxism&#148; is &#147;a materialism which 
  is absolutely atheistic and positively hostile to all religion.&#148; His hostility 
  bordered on hysteria: &#147;Every religious idea, every idea of God, even flirting 
  with the idea of God, is unutterable vileness  vileness of the most dangerous 
  kind, &#145;contagion&#146; of the most abominable kind. Millions of sins, filthy 
  deeds, acts of violence and physical contagions  are far less dangerous than 
  the subtle, spiritual idea of a God decked out in the smartest &#145;ideological&#146; 
  customs. Every defense or justification of the idea of God, even the most refined, 
  the best intentioned, is a justification of reaction.&#148;

<p><a name="Mesmerism"></a><b>Mesmerism:</b> An 18th century movement begun in 
  France by the Austrian doctor Franz Anton Mesmer, who believed that <a href="#Astrology">astrological</a> 
  influence on humans was conveyed through a force or substance similar to magnetism. 
  He first began treating patients with magnets or charged fluids but quickly 
  modified his position, theorizing that cures were actually coming from an energy 
  or mysterious &#147;magnetic fluid&#148; coming from the hands, voice, or nervous 
  system of the practitioner. This invisible substance or magnetism was thought 
  to be similar to electro-magnetism and was dubbed &#147;Animal Magnetism.&#148; 
  Mesmer&#146;s pupils were later able to induce a &#147;magnetic sleep&#148;

<p><b><a name="Mind Control"></a>Mind Control: </b>(Thought Reform, brainwashing) 
  While evangelicals are lack consensus on the nature, extent or, in some cases, 
  even existence of Mind Control, the Bible does warns against seducers, deceivers, 
  and exploiters who employ methods that can bring about spiritual harm and/or 
  personal abuse. The Mind Control or Thought Reform model, as for instance developed 
  by <a href="#Lifton">Robert Lifton</a>, suggests that there are specific methods 
  of deception that can be employed by abusive spiritual leaders that may result 
  in a diminished capacity for critical thinking and suppression of autonomy in 
  their followers.&nbsp; These methods are believed to involve an intense social 
  influence conditioning program which may include a closed system of authoritarian 
  control, manipulative, group dynamics, a system of punishment and rewards, induced 
  dissociation or <a href="#Trance">trance</a> induction, information control,

  interpreted to mean that the subject is not responsible for the consequences

  however, pushes for a revolution to free themselves from male enslavement and 
  exploitation. Among those holding this ideology are some lesbians who attempt 
  to perpetuate an actual anti-male position. Theologically, radical feminism

  into a complete break with Catholicism. The reformers&#146; major doctrinal 
  issues included a rejection of: the authority of the following: the authority 
  of the Pope, church control of Bible translation and interpretation, a distinction 
  in value between laity and clergy, and salvation being a product of the church 
  and its sacraments (<a href="#SavWorks">salvation by works</a>). A more thorough

  When Smith died, those who accepted Brigham Young as the Smith&#146;s successor

  Christ of Latter-day Saints</a> (LDS). Those who rejected Young and accepted 
  Smith&#146;s son, Joseph Smith, III, remained in Missouri and became known as 
  the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (RLDS). The doctrines 
  of the two groups eventually became radically different. The RLDS have a slightly 
  different version of the Book of Mormon and Doctrine and Covenants, and they 
  reject the Pearl of Great Price as scripture. The RLDS do not hold to many of 
  the LDS distinctive doctrines, including the polygamy of the 19th century LDS 
  Church and the LDS belief (still held) that God was once a man. In recent years 
  the church has experienced divisions, with more conservative <a href="#Restoration">Restoration

  <a href="#Protestantism">Protestantism</a> are still seen most clearly in the 
  issues of the <a href="#Reformation">Reformation</a>. The 16th century reformers 
  distinguished themselves from Catholicism in two key ways. First, they saw the

  the Pope, church dogma or tradition. Second, the reformers taught <a href="#SavGrace">salvation 
  by &#147;grace</a> alone&#148; (<i>sola gracia</i>). They also insisted that 
  <i>sola gracia</i> could be faithfully maintained only by understanding the 
  <a href="#Gospel">gospel</a> to be the message of a free pardon and righteous 
  standing with God through &#147;faith alone&#148; (<i>sola fide</i>) in the 
  imputed righteousness of Christ. The Roman Catholic Church claimed (and still 
  claims) to affirm <i>sola gracia,</i> but anathematized sola fide, teaching 
  instead that grace is received and maintained by a combination of faith plus 
  works (religious rites, sacraments, or human endeavor).

  between innocuous speculation that extraterrestrial beings may have visited 
  Earth to quasi-religious devotion to the alleged presence and teachings of aliens. 
  Often these beings are believed to be non-physical (spiritual) entities who 
  are communicating telepathically (psychically) with contactees. Their messages

<p><b><a name="Word-Faith"></a>Word-Faith Movement:</b> A movement based in large 
  part on the teachings of E. W. Kenyon (1867-1948) that became a distinct movement 
  under the teaching and leadership of Kenneth Hagin, a Pentecostal faith-healing 
  evangelist. God himself is said to have created the world and to do all that 
  he does by speaking words of faith. Man&#146;s creation in God&#146;s image 
  is commonly understood to mean that human beings are &#147;little gods&#148; 
  capable of speaking creative words of faith. The fall of Adam into sin is interpreted 
  as having transformed Adam (and all unredeemed people) into Satan&#146;s nature 
  and as having transferred Adam&#146;s godhood or dominion on earth to <a href="#Satan">Satan</a>. 
  <a href="#Jesus">Jesus</a> is believed to have become man in order to restore 
  human beings to godhood as renewed &#147;incarnations&#148; of God. He is said 
  to have done this by dying spiritually as well as physically on the cross, suffering 
  in hell, and then while in hell becoming the first person to be &#147;born again,&#148; 
  before finally being raised from the dead. Those who believe in Jesus are supposedly 
  empowered to speak words of faith again, especially in order to obtain bodily 
  health and financial prosperity (both of which are supposedly guaranteed as 
  present possessions in the Atonement). . In contrast, traditional Christian 
  theology teaches that God and God alone can bring about whatever he chooses; 
  that man was created to reflect God&#146;s character and to implement his will, 
  not to be little gods; that man is fallen but not Satanic in nature; that God 
  is still in control of this world; that Jesus Christ alone is God incarnate; 
  that Jesus died physically, not spiritually, to redeem us; that Jesus therefore 
  was not born again; and that health and prosperity are promised to believers 
  in the future resurrection. In the meantime God heals and prospers people providentially 
  and miraculously when and as he sees fit. Most of the followers of the Word-Faith 
  teachers are Pentecostals and other <a href="#EvanChrist">evangelical Christians</a>.
