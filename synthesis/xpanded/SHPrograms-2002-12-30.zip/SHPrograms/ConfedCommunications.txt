Wahoo. A great starting point !

Lets talk about speed of communication.

*************************************************************************************************************
Note: I am answering these as if this is all cast in stone. In reality I am very open to the possibility that 
what I am laying out doesn't "sing" so feel free to come back with alternate realities..
*************************************************************************************************************

My goal is to have a mix of information rich core worlds and a frontier that can be used to shelter 
the shady types (those that don't enter the MI).

The confederation communication network in the confed is a mixture of several different 
"pipes".

Between the systems that can afford them there are high bandwidth/high speed transition point repeaters 
that use (starttrek science warning) tachyon beams for communication. The cost is high to allow for the 
positioning, timing and targeting software/hardware. Communication to these relays in normal is done via 
laser. Therefore it is typically (0.5 - 2.0) days for a communication to go between systesm. (0.25 - 1 day day on each side)
Physical courier in most cases will take 2-3 times that. Of course, while the bandwidth of the link itself is high, the 
incoming lasers and other forms may be more limited.

Systems that need emergency communications and are unwilling or unable to afford the 
cost of a full service relay will typically have a torp relay. A torp relay takes 
in communications via laser and transmits it to a simple (but expensive) unmanned torp 
which is launched through the transition point and which then transmits its message to the 
relay on the other side. The speed is almost the same as the full service but the cost of 
recovering and recoditioning the toprs is high and the bandwidth is lower than the full service.

Couriers exist at the frontier. Cost or Choice ? Both in many cases. In many Calvinist systems 
the full-service relay is not available for general use, only government use. "Bulk" mail comes via 
couriers. 

Commercial news and records services have started to pop into existence. Bulk updates are carried on couriers or merchants which 
are actually a higher bandwidth than most methods because memory is so dense and cheap and light compared to the transmission rate
achievable with laser. Warner Media is one of the biggest providers of that service. And people pay a subscription fee fpr the data and 
others pay to be certified for input into the system. Each bit of info is timestamped and priority stamped. A inputter of data
can ask that his entry superseed all previous ones for a fee.

So can someone run to the frontier and outrun their rep ? Absolutely. If they are wanted badly enough
there are private bounty hunters. And if the confed wants them there are the Marshalls.

But the frontier is measured in terms of jumps. And not even just the raw number but the number of 
jumps away from a full service relay. The "Wiccan" and "Calvinist" worlds are the most commonly assumed 
to be part of the frontier but both sets of systems have (mostly) full service relays.

In the case of records of a terrorist attack on another planet you will probably get a list of casualties and 
their names as well as the Media Service's ids for those people but full biography downloads will come 
by slowboat if they are paid for.

Like all empires that have frontiers language is definitely affected by this. Not only do you have the 
colonies that have been rediscovered and the language drift there, you also have the colnies that only have a 
slowboat or other transmission method. Theer will always be drift. As the core of the confed spreads outward 
(i.e. gets full service relays in place) along the transition lines there will be Australia like merging back 
into the main stream but the cuyltural diferences will remain. The drift will even be even more pronounced 
in those regions interconnected among themselves by high speed links but separated from the main core by a slowboat...

Most of this holds true cleanly for the Terran derived worlds. The other cultures have their own way of dealing with this. 
The Proximans have purchased a their own network from a Terran news servce and get full news feeds throughout the main channels 
of the Proximan empire. The Alphans have established Alphan only accessible relays that take feds from terran relays and 
allows Alphan vessels to download as necessary.

At the moment there are no standards other than the Confed's own tranmission service. The different news services have a 
vested interest in keep someone hooked on their software. The other races throughout the Confed are beginning to adopt 
Terran media formats. They seem to be more compact and well thought out (and yes, Alien porn is a big seller). There are 
standards comittees but it is expected that it will be years until some agreement is come to. Of course, the war may change that.

There are background news services such as AP. But most of them seem to be house organs for various 
goverments or organizations. The Kavenists run the only truly independent one but for some reason more 
information goes in than goes out.

Q. Do you need special wall plug adapters to plug in your Terran hairdryer when you are on Proxima?  
A. No, proxima runs on a power broadcast network so they provide adapter cells for powering most things.

Q. Do you need special data interface equipement?
A. Yes, and then some. At the moment there realy are only a small handful of terrans who have used 
proximan data processors. 

Q. Are some colonies so out of date that they are using obsoleted standards
from 20 years ago?  Imagine if you had to go connect to a computer that
could only support kermit and 5&1/4" floppies.  Are there cross the boards
incompatibility issues that effect travellers when they move from system to
system?
A. There are some colonies (many as a matter of fact) on which there are no 
computers. Data access is the most outstanding problem of the confed traveller 
(especially outside the core worlds.) Within the systems that have computers 
the problems are less pronounced. Most adhere to the Apple-Cray standards 
of Net Interchange (ACNI), GMHD's Exchange Mark Up (EMU) or the Silverstone 
Systems Intergalatic (SSI) markups.

Q. Are kaibatsu's common enough that there might be
whole communities that universally adopt a single brand standard?  Imagine
tring to live with a Win2K laptop in MacLand.  Are DataOp,... skills brand
specialized or brand specific?  I assume you would not have Windows DataOps
but is there a Familiarize with OS skill/filter?
A. Not really, sort of... GMHD, Silverstone and Apple-Cray all are in the business of selling 
modular hardware/OS components so that each Corp has its own standard set 
of components that make up its in-house OS. Exchange is relatively standardized 
but internals are not.
