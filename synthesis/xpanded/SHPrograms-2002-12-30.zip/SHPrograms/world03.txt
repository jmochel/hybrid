             Thoughts about SF-world building, Fermi question and such

             As many of you know, on Oct 26 I started off a discussion on SF Gen

             basically asking people which they preferred, Hard-SF or Soft-SF. R
             came back indicating that Hard-SF was preferred predominantly over 

             cinematic styles of Star Wars, Star Trek, and the rest of their Sof

             ilk. It wasn't so much the technological level of Star Wars (versus
             2001) which bothered people. It was more the logical discrepancies,

             "gonzotech" in Eric Tolle's words, and the "annoying shallowness" t

             paraphrase Phil Goetz. Neelakantan Krishnaswami argued that High-Te
             okay, but only insofar as it is rigorously thought out, not only in

             of technological repercussions but also in terms of the social and 

             ramifications. Even Erol Bayburt, who preferred the cinematic style
             Soft-SF, agreed that no matter how you bend (or break) science, the

             result must, at least, be internally consistent.


             All these responses got me to thinking that if rigorous internal

             consistency is so highly prized, then we've got ourselves a whopper
             problem right off the bat. What problem? Fermi's Question, of cours

             that was the central subject of my Nov 9 follow-up article.


             What is Fermi's question? Basically, stated, it's: "Where are they?


             "They" as in the extra-terrestrials. Enrico Fermi, the nobel- prize

             physicist purportedly posed this question at a social dinner many m

             ago, captivating his listeners with the perplexity of probabilities
             argue that extra-terrestrials ought to exist versus the apparently 

             fact that they are nowhere to be found. For us modern-day munchkins

             isn't so much of a problem. We can rationalize the dilemma in any n
             ways, the three most obvious being:



             (1) Extra-terrestrials don't exist, at least not in this galaxy. We
             one and only example of sentience anywhere in the Milky Way. The

             probabilities are just way less than people realize.


             (2) They do exist, but they can't visit us because of the impondera

             difficulties of interstellar travel. And while they might be able t
             communicate with us, they've never seen any point in trying.



             (3) They do exist, and they have visited us, but they want to leave
             alone for the time being and see how we do. If they do interact wit

             governments at all, it's behind the scenes, where they won't be not

             for us trying to tune in to their interstellar internet, there's re
             point in trying. They use real-time fractal compression and spread-

             communications and tachyon pulses and whatnot, so don't even bother

             not in the same league, much less the same ballpark.


             However, for the writer of a science fiction setting which is "rigo
             internally consistent" and yet has a high-speed, cinematic,

             starwars/trekish, go-anywhere-and-quickly sort of flavor, we find t

             of these rationalizations hold up. Number one doesn't hold up for o
             reasons. After all, there are aliens in Trek. Number two is weak. Y

             we're the only ones to discover warp drive? And number three... wel

             this were true, then any voyage into the unknown would stumble acro
             monstrously huge, tremendously ancient, and extraordinarily advance

             civilization. Obviously, since humans dominate a huge section of sp

             Star Trek as well as Star Wars, probably the single two most famous
             settings to date (which is why they are being used in this discussi

             would think that this is not the case.


             So the questions is, how do we rationalize this inconsistency?


             I mentioned one possible solution from Michael McCollum's Antares D

             forsake it as being too limiting on interstellar travel for my own 

             tastes. Bertil Jonell, one of the more renowned of the TML denizens
             replied with a whole laundry list of explanations. I've taken two o

             and perverted them slightly.


             (1) Berzerkers: Some ancient space-faring civilization, the first b

             the block, in fact, decided to send out a huge armada of Berzerker 

             These robots were capable of self-replication through some fixed nu
             iterations. They were also loaded with all manner of nuclear armame

             When they'd detect the first signs of a possible competitive civili

             usually though reception of radio broadcasts and whatnot, they'd mo
             over and drop a few bombs. End of problem. Well, due to some error 

             programming, the berzerkers in this section of the galaxy just sort

             stopped functioning for some reason (who knows, maybe they became
             self-aware and developed moral qualms), so all of a sudden, we get 

             races popping their heads up at roughly the same time, and we Human

             so happen to be in this wave. Stumbling across one of these high-te
             berzerker relics could be a major event of the campaign.


             (2) Battlefield Earth: Warring/Scheming High-Tech powers fight thei

             battles indirectly, through puppet societies and various low-end

             civilizations. Earth (or the "Terran Republic") becomes entangled i
             conflict. We are supported by one power and embroiled in a war with

             races which are supported by other powers. It may even be the case 

             Humanity was "uplifted" for this very purpose. In an odd sort of wa
             situation is reminiscent of that of Gods settling their petty dispu

             though the races which they created and which they control.


             Bertil had some other interesting ideas, but I omitted them as they

             resulted in settings with a far different feel from what I'm lookin

             Plus, a few of them seemed so bizarre that even Bertil admitted the
             cop-outs.


             Richard Baker suggested another idea which I'll touch on briefly.




             (3) The NanoVirus: Way back when the first two civilizations had th

             great war, some whacko conceived and released a nanite (a microscop
             machine) capable of infiltrating a lifeform of fairly broad paramet

             replicating and surreptitiously spreading through the lifeform's sp

             and after a given delay, killing all the lifeforms with which it ha
             into contact. Hence, not only did it destroy the first war's winner

             other civilizations came to inspect the ruins of that war, it infil

             and destroyed their civilizations as well. The downside of this ide
             that it is only a matter of time before it comes after us. "Spock, 

             this. These ancient records say that the Argoans were destroyed jus

             all those other civilizations.... by a little mach.... ack!"


             While Geoffrey Grabowski felt this idea smacked of political statem

             only qualm with it is that it doesn't leave enough room for *lots* 
             aliens co-mingling in a vast interstellar community.


             Anders Sandberg suggested another option having to do with current

             worm-hole theory. "If wormholes work as they appear to do in theory

             expanding wormhole empire will meet other empires at roughly the sa
             regardless of their age and distance!" (See Traversable Wormholes b

             Michael Price)


             I haven't yet taken a look at it, but I'm sure I will sometime in t

             future. As for other reading/viewing material:


                *Neil Mackie suggests 2001 Nights, a collection of Japanese grap

                 novels. An English translation is distributed by Viz comics.

                *Peter Tupper suggests David Brin's Uplift series which incident

                 served as the basis for a GURPS supplement by the same name. He

                 suggests David Gerrold's Chess with the Dragon.

                *Jim Cambias echoed Peter's comments regarding Uplift. He also s

                 a new television series: Earth 2.


             Just to finish up the recap of responses, John Kim was annoyed over

             intimation that SF campaigns should have aliens in order to be inte
             "SF campaigns can be about anything: espionage, colonization, myste

             police work, trading missions, horror, and loads more." John also s

             that advanced civilizations could stay hidden if they wanted to (fo
             example, the Q-Continuum, ala Star Trek fame).


             As to the second point, I feel it ranks down there on the list of c

             I think John actually felt this way as well, judging from his remar


             As to the first point, I apologize if I sounded like I was putting 

             anyone's campaign. I guess I'm wrapped-up in the idea of putting to

             an SF-setting with a StarWarzish flavor, and since that flavor nece
             aliens (and preferably lots of them), I've been steering the discus

             that direction.


             No disrespect intended to those of you who don't make use of aliens

             actually count myself among your number, as I've been steering away
             aliens for several years now mainly because the Fermi question has 

             such a bother.


             It is worth noting that J.D. Frazer posted some details regarding h

             century science-fiction cops campaign in response to the aliens iss

             was trying to show that you can have a perfectly good SF campaign w
             aliens, and it's true, you can. But, of course, for those of us who

             incorporate aliens due to whatever personal prejudices we hold dear

             bit of reasoning isn't extrodinarily helpful. Hence, while I felt h
             point (and John's) was somewhat off topic, I felt his basic reason 

             steering clear of aliens to be very much on topic. Enough so that I

             full quote.

             Unless, of course, we have a technological ceiling up ahead, which 
             derail this argument, at least insofar as the technology issue is

             concerned. And if social and economic aspects are tied to technolog

             one might argue, well... you can see my point easily enough. In any
             yes, having aliens in a campaign necessitates lots of work, at leas

             want to do it well. Is it really worth it in the end? I guess that 

             can only be answered on an individual basis. My supposition in star
             this thread was that it is worth it, or that it's at least worth ex



             At this point, however, I think I'll hang back and switch over to a
             thread, even though there were numerous other responses which I cou

             (including a rather Malthusian thesis proposed by Bertil that Fermi

             question may be solved by the notion of mandatory self-exterminatio
             that any given race, even a space-faring one, must outstrip its res

             and self-destruct as a mathematical inevitability due to the rather

             fact that spherical volume grows more rapidly than surface area as 
             of colonization expands in size). I leave you techno- junkies to ca

             this out on your pocket TIs.


             Now, as to that other topic I promised... ah yes... here it is. Wor

             Building.


             Ahem. This could take some time.


             In my follow-up article of Nov 9, I proposed a fairly generic

             classification scheme which, me being a humanities major (that is m
             perennial excuse, by the way), I felt was just vague enough to be u

             It went something like this:


                *Solar Companion: Not technically a world but not the main star 

                 a part of the close-binary pair.

                 Gas Giant: Fairly obvious. Great for wilderness refueling if we
                *
                 using hydrogen to get around.


                *Greenhouse: A world gone to hell because of too much greenhouse

                *Planetoid: A very small world, generally. Not necessarily round

                 atmosphere to speak of. Composed of rock or ice.

                *Belch Ball: You don't want to breath the atmosphere. Probably c

                 in the extreme.

                 Primordial: A very young world. Atmosphere varies.
                *

                *Geologically instable. Lots of volcanos and magma seas.

                 Desert World: Breathable atmosphere (at least with filter or
                *
                 compressor) but no water that isn't tied up as ice crystals in 

                 soil.

                *Exotic: Not an atmosphere you want to breath, maybe because it 

                 poisonous gasses or even lethal micro-organisms. But not a plac

                 can't otherwise walk around, so long as you have your own oxyge
                 supply. Note that an alien ecosystem may well be thriving.


                *Magma Ball: Ouch, this place is hot.

                *Vacuum Ball: Like the moon, essentially. Lots of rock. No atmos


                *Shallow World: Has atmosphere but not enough to breath, at leas
                 without descending to a very deep altitude. Mars could be an ex


                *Dead World: The place is certainly colonizable, but for one rea

                 another, life either never existed or went extinct long ago. Ma
                 an ice-world. Or maybe it's a near desert. Maybe the sun flared
                 knocked out the entire ecosystem. Or maybe a slew of meteors st

                 churning up enough dust that the sun was blotted out for decade

                *Garden World: Earth is a prime example. Not only can you breath

                 atmosphere without mechanical aid, but life, either native or
                 transplanted, thrives in abundance.


                *Water World: Over 90% covered by water and ice. Possibly a brea

                 atmosphere. Possibly a teaming native ecosystem which got
                 evolutionarily stuck due to the total lack of any freestanding

                 continents.


             I didn't get quite as many comments on this puppy, but I was surpri

             see that one reader did catch me red-handed in the act of plagiaris
             er... I mean research. Right! That's it. Research! :-)



             Mitch Gold, (if memory serves) the former moderator for
             rec.games.frp.archives, sent me a copy of the following planetary

             classification scheme which was posted to rec.games.frp many eons a

             which bears a suspicious similarity to the one I posted on Nov 9.

             In fact, this table was originally printed (to the best of my knowl
             a book entitled Worlds of the Federation by Shane Johnson. I chose 

             table as a basis for what I was doing, not so much because I like t

             classification system, but because I always feel this strange compu
             base my work on *something*, and this table happened to be sitting 

             of my when the compulsion hit me. In any case, my perversions of th

             were never approved by Paramount. :-)


             As for comments on the scheme, Bertil suggested looking into 2300AD

             briefly, and I have more to say about that later. Anders, meanwhile

             Never mind about technological inconsistencies. Never mind about Fe
             Question. Let's just talk about some simple chemistry. The majority

             popular SF is literally drowning in these sort of inconsistencies, 

             because the majority of the audience is scantily educated in such m
             they get away with it time and time again.



             The problem is so pervasive that even our popular SF-RPGs have succ
             Traveller, arguably the most popular SF-RPG, uses in its basic plan

             profile system a classification scheme for atmospheres which focuse

             primarily on density, not composition. When they finally got around
             handling atmospheric composition in the World Builder's Handbook (t

             being produced by DGP, not GDW), they came up with the following

             atmospheric taints: disease, gas mix, high oxygen, low oxygen, poll
             sulfur compounds. That's it. Honest. That's the whole damn list. We

             okay, I think "radiation" was mentioned on a separate chart, but ev

             including that, we're talking seven taints. Think about it. This bo
             entitled "World Builder's Handbook". Atmosphere is arguably the mos

             important component of a world. "So like, Jim, can we like breath o

             world or what?" And this is what they came up with. Okay, I'll stop
             ranting. No need for a tranquilizer. Really, I'm okay. :-)


             SJG goes into slightly more detail. For atmospheric composition we'

             Reducing (Methane, CO2, and/or Hydrogen), Oxygen- Nitrogen (with on

             most vaguely established percentage ranges), Polluted (pollen, ash,
             industrial pollutants, etc), Exotic (hydrogen, methane, carbon oxid

             nitrogen), Corrosive (ammonia, chlorine, fluorine, high-oxygen, nit

             sulfur compounds, and water vapor). However, this detail is never r
             fleshed out. What are the peculiarities of such atmospheric composi

             Under what conditions are you likely to find them. Do you really ne

             in order to sustain free-standing oxygen in an atmosphere? Which ga
             incompatible? In short, give me a process to follow.



             To give SJG the credit they deserve, they touch on a lot of these i
             and they make a good attempt at formalizing it all with a process, 

             still get the feeling that if what we're looking for is Hard-SF,

             detail-oriented, chemical mucky-mucking, we can go even further (an
             we can *always* go further).


             I decided to take Bertil's advice and take a look at 2300AD. This t

             provides us with a list of gasses along with their molecular weight

             no means to determine the percentages of dominance. Here's the list
             way.


               


                Molecular Hydrogen (H2)      2.0
                Helium (He)                  4.0
                Methane (CH4)               16.0
                Ammonia (NH3)               17.0
                Water Vapor (H2O)           18.0
                Neon (Ne)                   20.2
                Molecular Nitrogen (N2)     28.0
                Carbon Monoxide (CO)        28.0
                Nitric Oxide (NO)           30.0
                Molecular Oxygen (O2)       32.0
                Hydrogen Sulfide (H2S)      34.1
                Argon (Ar)                  39.9
                Carbon Dioxide (CO2)        44.0
                Nitrous Oxide (N2O)         44.0
                Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2)      46.0
                Ozone (O3)                  48.0
                Sulfur Dioxide (SO2)        64.1
                Sulfur Trioxide (SO3)       80.1
                Krypton (Kr)                83.8
                Xenon (Xe)                 131.3


             The basic idea is that you figure out your planetary diameter and d
             and from that you can figure out the minimum molecular weight retai

             Then you consult this little table, and you can figure out which ga

             have bled off into space. For Earth, I guess, that would be Hydroge
             Helium.


             2300AD does give rules for determining oxygen content, but they are

             much based on the world's hydrosphere. The presence or absence of l

             never figures into the equation. Likewise, there are no rules for
             determining the preponderance of other gasses. Nor are there rules 

             determine what effects these other gasses might have, if any.


             Looking toward net publications with my last lingering strands of h

             found that even Ross Smith's Planet Generation System which was pos

             a year ago makes no attempt to determine atmospheric gasses. Indeed
             together the sum of these four separate systems, there seems to be 

             argument issuing forth that such details are unnecessary, even cumb


             I think, going back to my original question of Oct 26, that this wa

             least part of the sort of question I was getting at. I mean, in Sof
             not only do we see lots of violation of various rules of chemistry 

             setting plays a subservient role to the story, but we also see a re

             disregard for the details of setting in general. I don't mean "disr
             in a negative sense. All I'm saying is that such details are viewed

             trivial... as entirely irrelevant and beneath consideration and per

             even a bit dangerous (after all, the less you say, the less there i
             foul up on).



             Consider, Classic Traveller used a single digit to represent a plan
             atmosphere, and they got away with it for an awful long time. I hea

             people on the TML (the Traveller Mailing List if you need some help

             this acronym) complain about all sorts of things, but the issue of
             atmospheric composition wasn't a memorable part of the discussion. 

             is that while many SF gamers would like to think of themselves as e

             "Hard-SF" over "Soft-SF", most don't want to be concerned with such
             matters as a planet's atmosphere. Far more fun to just "wing it", e

             there are freeware programs to generate and record such minutia.


             I remember a long discussion we had on the TML back in February of 

             regarding main world generation. I still have a copy of the discuss
             fact, which is why I'm able to remember the date. But the reason I 

             up is because Bruce Pihlamae said something conspicuously noteworth

             said, instead of looking at mainworld generation or even at star sy
             generation as a frozen process, that is, as a process which you und

             without any regard to the age of the star or the age of the planets

             about instead looking at it as an evolutionary process.


             For those of you who have generated characters in Traveller, you pr

             know what I'm talking about. You don't just roll attributes and pic
             as in many other games. You undertake a career. You make choices in

             career. And as you go through this process, not only do you generat

             character, but you also generate the character's career history. Ho
             appropriate it is, then, to transfer this concept over to star syst

             generation. Start with a cloud of dust breaking off from some stell

             nursery and take it through an iterative process. Time consuming if
             manually, but a computer could do it quickly and perhaps even gener

             results which make more sense than the results from a frozen proces

             they'd have to make sense, because they wouldn't be just random die
             They'd be part of a world's geologic history, and the process would

             sure they fit into that history.


             Well, as you can see, this whole issue of planetary generation can 

             somewhat cloudy. Here I've managed to ramble on about planetary atm
             for God only knows how long, and yet there are so many other factor

             consider, and the difficult part is that they're all interrelated. 

             instead of scooting on ahead into yet more mundane and possibly
             mind-boggling matters of world generation, I'm going to return to a

             of my original question of Oct 26. In short, do you as a gamer (eit

             player or gamemaster) prefer to deal with this stuff, or do you pre
             just ignore it? And how you answer that question, I think, says a b

             what sort of gamer you are. I personally can go either way. I find 

             my players don't give a rat's hindquarters, however, and I really d
             blame them. But your groups may be different, and whichever the cas

             like to hear about it.
