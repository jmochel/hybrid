      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Since the discovery 
        of the first extrasolar planet by Queloz and Mayor in 1995, theorists 
        get more and more data about the properties of extrasolar planets and 
        their systems.<br>
        Our solar system is not anymore the only one existing, it is not anymore 
        special. Most of the new found extrasolar planets have extreme properties: 
        Extrasolar planets were found with masses up to 15 Jupitermasses, semi-major 
        axis down to 0.04 AU and eccentricities up to 0.93.<br>
        So far, all extrasolar planets have been detected using the high-precision 
        radial velocity (Doppler) measurements, two of them with a direct transit 
        of the planet in front of the central star. While there are a lot of new 
        ideas for the detection, both directly using infrared techniques and indirectly 
        by microlensing effects, no extra solar planet could be found by any different 
        method. Planets with significantly lower mass than Jupiter cannot be detected 
        with current radial velocity and moreover planets with a large semi-major 
        axis and therefore long periods require a long time measurement of several 
        years. That is why less massive planets on greater orbital radii are expected 
        to be found in the next years. There is, however, evidence for two sub-saturn 
        massive planets.<br>
        Based on present knowledge, it is assumed that about 5% of solar-type 
        stars host massive planets, which means in other words the number of planets 
        in our galaxy can be up to one billion.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Planet formation is 
        highly correlated to star formation. Today theories assume planet formation 
        and star formation to take place in the same protoplanetary or protostellar 
        accretion disk. So let us first take a look at star formation itself:</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the so-called standard 
        model of star formation, stars form from gravitational instabilities in 
        interstellar clouds of dust and gas. If in a certain region of the cloud 
        the gravitational binding energy exceeds its thermal energy, the region 
        begin to contract. This is called the Jeans instability criterion. This 
        can happen due to a distortion by e.g. a shock wave due to a novae nearby. 
        After several time, a accretion disk is formed out of the cloud due to 
        angular momentum conservation. Dust and grain particles now settle to 
        the midplane in the disk.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">These accretion disks 
        are the birthplaces of planets. In a first step, dust and grain particles 
        hit and stick together in the disk and form objects with sizes up to several 
        meters, all of them orbiting the central star in the same direction. As 
        a comparable picture, one might think about the objects found in the rings 
        of Saturn. Further collisions lead to the formation of so-called planetesimals 
        with sizes up to one kilometer that interact by gravitation. Afterwards, 
        the gravitational interaction leads to changes in their orbits and growing 
        is possible by further collisions. Finally one gets so-called embryos, 
        that can have masses of about 10e-7 solar masses in the terrestrial region. 
        Out of these embryos form the later planets, depending on several circumstances 
        either terrestrial planets or giant planets are formed. Terrestrial planets 
        consist of rock material while giant planets are gas planets, which can 
        only form beyond the so-called snowy line, the ice-condensation radius, 
        which is about 4 AU. Fragmentation and collisions lead to the formation 
        of terrestrial planets, while giant gas planets form differently:<br>
        Following the so-called core instability model, a massive solid core located 
        beyond the ice-condensation radius can get large enough to accrete gas 
        out of the disk, and finally gets more and more massive.<br>
        As a result of all these accretion and collision processes, there are 
        a lot of less massive rock particles at arbitrary orbits, which form the 
        later comets.<br>
        Finally the planet formation process stops by the disappearence of the 
        accretion disk itself.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Based on the new data 
        of extrasolar planets, one gets into trouble describing the formation 
        of giant planets. As mentioned above high massive planet formation is 
        not thought to be possible for orbital radii less than the ice-condensation 
        radius, but high massive planets were discovered down to 0.04 AU. Furthermore, 
        planets with up to 15 jupitermasses were found, and it is not quite clear, 
        whether the standard model can describe the formation of such planets 
        by gas accretion. A high massive protoplanet can open a gap in the orbital 
        region by tidal interaction between the protoplanet and the disk. In detail, 
        gap opening occurs if the gravitational torques excerted by the protoplanet 
        exceed the internal torques due to the viscosity in the disk. However, 
        gap opening decreases the accretion rate since the material of the disk 
        is pushed away from the planet at the planet's orbital region. Therefore 
        it is of interest whether accretion can stop totally or if the resulting 
        decreased accretion rate still leads to high massive planets during the 
        estimated lifetime of the protoplanetary disk (which is about 10e6-10e7 
        years). Furtheron, it follows from analytical considerations that a embedded 
        protoplanet migrates in the disk as soon as the torques from the inside 
        of the disk and the outside of the disk differ. It is assumed, that giant 
        planets form on radii beyond the snow-line and migrate inwards, where 
        they will be stopped by a unknown mechanism (e.g. by interaction with 
        other protoplanets or magnetohydrodynamical effects). It is even possible 
        that giant planets form out of several smaller gas planets which migrated 
        inwards from radii beyond the snow-line and collided in the inner region 
        of the disk.</font></p>

        a protoplanetary disk with one or several embedded protoplanet(s) have 
        been simulated using <a href="sph.html">Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics</a>. 
        We have used a undistorted keplerian accretion disk as our initial particle 
        distribution. Most of the simulations were twodimensional, although threedimensional 
        disks were simulated but as no significant differences were found, the 
        threedimensional simulations were skipped due to longer simulation times. 
        For all simulations we used the code <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">v3sph3d<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">, 
        which has been developed by Roland Speith. <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">v3sph3d<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
