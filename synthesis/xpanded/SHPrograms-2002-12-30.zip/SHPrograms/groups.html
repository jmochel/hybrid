What exactly is the mandate for this newsgroup (<B style="color:black;background-color:#ffff66">alt</B>.<B style="color:black;background-color:#ff66ff">history</B>.<B style="color:black;background-color:#ff9999">future</B>)?

[Note that I have copied this posting to <B style="color:black;background-color:#ffff66">alt</B>.<B style="color:black;background-color:#A0FFFF">society</B>.<B style="color:black;background-color:#99ff99">futures</B>,

newsgroups also seem to be relevant to the contents of this posting].

For instance, I am a reader of a well-written and well-organized
revelatory book entitled _The Urantia Book_.  In it, a few of the
chapters (papers) are devoted to the long-term destiny of the human
race.  In short, the human race will continue to exist and to progress
culturally and scientifically, though not at steady rates.  The next
1,000 years will be especially tumultous from a cultural standpoint. 

The book seems to infer (though it never directlys tates this) that
interstellar travel is not feasible, at least at any time in the near
<B style="color:black;background-color:#ff9999">future</B> (the next 20,000 years, at any rate, IMO).  The real challenges
facing mankind are those of peaceful coexistence and global resource
management.  These challenges are only mastered over time, an
inevitable and inexorable byproduct of the evolutionary process.

The radically nonuniform development of our world is due to to our
bizarre and highly unusual early <B style="color:black;background-color:#ff66ff">history</B> (marred by events taking
origin in the Lucifer rebellion).  So, in addition to the usual
challenges facing our planet as the industrial and scientific age
spreads its influence, we also have to contend with cultures that have
not even progressed beyond the stages of tribal warfare (national
warfare is considered an advance over tribal warfare,
evolutionarily-speaking).

Additionally, the coalescing process of human groupings is portrayed
as a natural evolutionary byproduct.  Families lead to tribes.  Tribes
lead to states.  States lead to countries.  Countries lead to
multi-national alliances, which eventually lead to world government.


Here's a brief excerpt from paper 71, &quot;Development of the State.&quot;
This paper appears to be a guide to those persons who might be
involved with decision-making in some present or <B style="color:black;background-color:#ff9999">future</B> political

            2. THE EVOLUTION OF REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT

Democracy, while an ideal, is a product of civilization, not of
evolution. Go slowly! select carefully! for the dangers of democracy
are:

  1. Glorification of mediocrity.
  2. Choice of base and ignorant rulers.
  3. Failure to recognize the basic facts of social evolution.
  4. Danger of universal suffrage in the hands of uneducated and
     indolent majorities.
  5. Slavery to public opinion; the majority is not always right.

Public opinion, common opinion, has always delayed <B style="color:black;background-color:#A0FFFF">society</B>;
nevertheless, it is valuable, for, while retarding social evolution,
it does preserve civilization. Education of public opinion is the only
safe and true method of accelerating civilization; force is only a
temporary expedient, and cultural growth will increasingly accelerate
as bullets give way to ballots. Public opinion, the mores, is the
basic and elemental energy in social evolution and state development,
but to be of state value it must be nonviolent in expression.

The measure of the advance of <B style="color:black;background-color:#A0FFFF">society</B> is directly determined by the
degree to which public opinion can control personal behavior and state
regulation through nonviolent expression. The really civilized
government had arrived when public opinion was clothed with the powers
of personal franchise. Popular elections may not always decide things
rightly, but they represent the right way even to do a wrong
thing. Evolution does not at once produce superlative perfection but
rather comparative and advancing practical adjustment.

There are ten steps, or stages, to the evolution of a practical and
efficient form of representative government, and these are:

1. Freedom of the person. Slavery, serfdom, and all forms of human
bondage must disappear.

2. Freedom of the mind. Unless a free people are educated -- taught to
think intelligently and plan wisely -- freedom usually does more harm
than good.

3. The reign of law. Liberty can be enjoyed only when the will and
whims of human rulers are replaced by legislative enactments in
accordance with accepted fundamental law.

4. Freedom of speech. Representative government is unthinkable without
freedom of all forms of expression for human aspirations and opinions.

5. Security of property. No government can long endure if it fails to
provide for the right to enjoy personal property in some form. Man
craves the right to use, control, bestow, sell, lease, and bequeath
his personal property.

6. The right of petition. Representative government assumes the right
of citizens to be heard. The privilege of petition is inherent in free
citizenship.

7. The right to rule. It is not enough to be heard; the power of
petition must progress to the actual management of the government.

8. Universal suffrage. Representative government presupposes an
intelligent, efficient, and universal electorate. The character of
such a government will ever be determined by the character and caliber
of those who compose it. As civilization progresses, suffrage, while
remaining universal for both sexes, will be effectively modified,
regrouped, and otherwise differentiated.

9. Control of public servants. No civil government will be serviceable
and effective unless the citizenry possess and use wise techniques of
guiding and controlling officeholders and public servants.

10. Intelligent and trained representation. The survival of democracy
is dependent on successful representative government; and that is
conditioned upon the practice of electing to public offices only those
individuals who are technically trained, intellectually competent,
socially loyal, and morally fit. Only by such provisions can
government of the people, by the people, and for the people be
preserved.
