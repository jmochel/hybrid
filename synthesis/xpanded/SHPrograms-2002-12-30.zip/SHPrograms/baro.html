<h1>
The Baroclinic Instability in Protoplanetary Accretion Disk</h1>
by Hubert Klahr and Peter Bodenheimer
<p>Our global simulation shows that all the findings from local models
(see <a href="http://www.ucolick.org/~klahr/ttrund.html">Turbulence in
Accretion Disks</a>) can be confirmed. Actually the Reynolds-stresses are
even stronger than in the local simulations, as smaller wave numbers in
the azimuthal direction can be resolved.
<br>The wave number $ m = 1 $ seems to be the preferential mode of the
instability. A further discovery was the self-consistent formation of long
lived anti-cyclonic vortices as a direct result of the global baroclinic
instability. This may have major relevance for the formation process of
planets.
<p>The simulation (model 6) covers the entire $360\arcdeg$ of the circumference
of the disk and a radial section between 1 AU and 10 AU. The grid measures
$128\times128$ grid-cells, which are radially logarithmically distributed.
We can thus resolve azimuthal wave numbers between 1 and 128.
<br>The boundary conditions in the radial direction were changed from periodic
to simple non-reflecting outflow conditions (vanishing gradients),&nbsp;
not allowing for inflow. The density distribution again was $\rho \propto&nbsp;
R^{-1}$ (constant $\Sigma \approx 300$&nbsp; g cm$^{-2}$),&nbsp; and we
used a baroclinically unstable
<br>$K(R)$ as in model 3, which results from $H/r = 0.055$. The model was
first run into a stable 1D axisymmetric state, where the residual velocities
were less than
<br>$10^{-4}$ cm s$^{-1}$.&nbsp; Without a symmetry-breaking instability
and turbulence generation, this disk
<br>can not evolve and would stay perfectly laminar forever, as in&nbsp;
the ``dead zone'' described by&nbsp; Gammie (1996).
<p>The initial density distribution was then perturbed by&nbsp; random
noise of amplitude only 0.1$\%$.
<br>The initial state is practically axisymmetric. Figure 1 illustrates
the evolution of the flow in two
<br>space dimensions, over the full 360$\arcdeg$.

<i>Fig 1: Four snapshots of the evolution of surface density (colors: $500$
[red], $400$ [yellow], $300$ [green],&nbsp; to $100$ [blue] g/cm$^2$) in
the global model in polar ($r-\phi$) coordinates. The times&nbsp; are&nbsp;
a): 20, b): 95, c): 160 and d): 567 orbits at the outer radius. Contours
of equal temperatures are also shown.</i>
<p>After the first 20 orbits (700 yr at 10 AU; Fig.1) only littlestructure
has evolved.&nbsp; But with time a prominent anticyclonic vortex forms,which
reflects the assumption that $m=1$ is the preferred mode.
<br>Intermittently a&nbsp; second vortex also forms,&nbsp; and we assume
thattheir number is just limited by the narrowness of our disk and a lack
of matter. The vortex grows in mass and propagates radially outward,possibly
as a result of the gradient of backgroundvorticity and the fact that anticyclonic
vortices are a local sink in the global vorticity field.Anyway, as there
was never a radial drift ofvortices in barotropic flows reported, this
effect might also be linked to the baroclinic features of the flow. A detailed
investigation of this effect still has to
<br>be performed.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Figure 2 shows the situation after about $ 2 \times 10^4$ years in real
cartesian coordinates to give an impression of the global nature of the
simulation.

$500$ [red], $400$ [yellow], $300$ [green],&nbsp; to $100$ [blue] g/cm$^2$)
in the global model is projected in a cartesian frame after&nbsp; 567 orbits
at the outer radius, which corresponds to $\approx 2 \times 10^{4}$ yr.
Note that the condensation&nbsp; is partially artificially smeared out
in the $\varphi$-direction, which is a result of the low order advection
scheme. In reality one could expect the ``pre-protoplanet'' to be more
strongly confined.</i>

1.5 \times$ sound speed)&nbsp; in the global model in polar ($r-\varphi$)
coordinates after 567 orbits at the outer radius, which corresponds to
$\approx 2 \times 10^{4}$ yr. Plotted velocities&nbsp; in the $\varphi$
direction are obtained by subtracting the mean azimuthal velocity at each
radius, which explains why the vortex center seems to be displaced from
the density maximum.</i>
<p>A huge vortex has formed which has a factor 4 over-density with respect
to the ambient disk and a factor of 2 over-density with respect to the
initial local surface density. It is a high-pressure anticyclone that has
the property of collecting solid material in its center (Tanga et al.\
1996; Godon \&amp; Livio 1999b).
<br>At the same time the over-dense blob inherits a substantial fraction
of the disk gas, which isn't confined&nbsp; by self gravity but only by
the pressure gradient generated by the anti-cyclonic (less pro-grade) rotation.While
the initial nebula (from $1-10$ AU) had a mass of about $7.5 \times 10^{-3}
M_\sun$, there are only $4.4 \times 10^{-3} M_\sun$ left after $10^4$ years
which corresponds to a mass loss (radially inward and outward) of $3.1
\times 10^{-7}~ \mbox{M}_{\sun}~\mbox{yr}^{-1}$. We cannot tell in this
simulation how fast mass is being accreted onto the star as our computational
domain ends at $1AU$. The red blob collects a total of $4 \times 10^{29}
$&nbsp; g (67 M$_\earth$ or 0.2 Jupiter masses [M$_{\rm J}$]).&nbsp; Without
further addition of mass or cooling this object is not gravitationally
unstable, as the Toomre $Q$ in the disk is about 10 and the&nbsp;&nbsp;
local Jeans mass in the condensation is about 2.5 M$_{\rm J}$.
<p>We see that even in a disk which is not massive enough to fragment into
planets or brown dwarfs (Boss 1998), a kind of pre-protoplanet can form
simply as a result of baroclinicity and the resulting vorticity. The object,
which is not yet gravitationally bound, could evolve into a planet in one
of two ways: (1) it could&nbsp; efficiently collect solid particles in
the center and wait until the critical mass for gas accretion is reached,
or (2) it could concentrate enough gas and cool down efficiently to become
gravitationally unstable. In either scenario the time scale for planet
formation&nbsp; will be shorter than in cases without the vortices in the
disk. Additionally the vortex scenario can explain why there could be a
solid
<br>core in a planet even it formed by gravitational instability rather
than by accretion of solid material to form a core followed by gas capture.
