                The Grand List of Overused Science Fiction Clichés


       Those of us who have read or seen a lot of science fiction have seen
    certain story elements pop up over and over and over. Some of these
    elements were actually pretty good ideas, and when handled well make for
    a pretty entertaining story, but have become hackneyed from overuse by
    the unimaginative. Others came into being through the deliberate effort
    to avoid another cliché. Still other ideas were lame from the get-go, and
    should have been dismissed from the author's thinking.
       Clichés are not in themselves necessarily bad, but their overuse shows
    that the writer has forgotten what separates the strong tale from the
    hollow: "the human heart in conflict with itself," as Faulkner said.
    Where there is this conflict, the tale stands; where the conflict is
    absent, the tale falls flat, and in neither case does it matter how many
    ships get blown up.
       The sophisticated reader (one who reads more than just SF) will note
    that some of these clichés are not found solely in SF, but in other
    genres as well, and of course the lampooning of cliches is a time-honored
    part of good comedy.


       DISCLAIMER:  The use of masculine/feminine pronouns and assignment of
    gender roles is not intended to preclude a reversal of gender roles. It
    is, however, intended to offend those who think that the Y chromosome is
    the root of all evil. Nyah.

       This list is no longer "new and improved". The "improvements" were too
    much work to maintain.


      The Symbols:

           The green check marks those items which are not so bad, but have
    IMAGE  been used so many times that it takes a really strong treatment
           to lift them out of the slush pile. They will not destroy an
           otherwise well-written story, and some of the classics employ
           these elements (and employ them well).
           The yellow check marks those items which were mildly interesting
           the first time around, but simply provoke a response along the
    IMAGE  lines of "been there, done that" on the re-runs. Only a truly
           bizarre twist on these ideas can give them new life.

           The green cross marks those items which are baloney, but are
    IMAGE  tolerable for the sake of dramatic effect as long as the events
           of the story do not depend on them.

           The yellow cross marks those items which are lame, and support
           the plot in some way, but can be saved if there is a supporting
    IMAGE  justification. For instance, having a robot bleed oil when it
           gets shot is pretty lame; having a hydraulically-powered robot
           leak hydraulic fluid when shot is creditable.

           The red cross marks those items which flatly contradict the known
    IMAGE  laws of nature, introduce an irreconcilable contradiction,
           require the characters involved to have the IQ of a banana peel,
           or are abysmally stupid for some other reason.

    IMAGE  The Starfleet logo (found in the Best/Worst Examples column)
           marks those items for which Star Trek has been an offender.

    IMAGE  The piggy marks those items that are unconscionably sexist.

    IMAGE  The swastika marks those items that show racial, ethnic, or
           religious bigotry.

   centuries. 
      IMAGE

   fuddy-duddies complain. 

    * IMAGE IMAGE A problem involving an alien is resolved in a manner
   dependent on the unusual and heretofore-unknown location of the alien's
   reproductive organs. 

      IMAGE  The human abdomen is an ideal incubator for Alien Eggs/Spawn, and
    *
   this has no apparent effect on the host until the Alien Spawn erupts from
   their stomach in a messy fashion. 
      IMAGE

    1. IMAGE IMAGE  Super-intelligent computers blow up when the hero
       confuses them. 

       IMAGE
    2. 

   IMAGE
          Super-intelligent computers get confused when the hero says to them
   "everything I say is a lie" or some other paradoxical statement. 
      IMAGE IMAGE
    *             Space vessels lack fuses, circuit breakers, and surge
   supressors, so that the control panels explode when some distant portion
   of the ship is damaged. 

    * IMAGE IMAGE Computers get reprogrammed by someone who has no knowledge
   of the computer's operating system. 

      IMAGE
    *

    *
   Roman candles. 
      IMAGE
    *

   An item of technology is quickly reverse-engineered by a far less advanced
   group of researchers. 
      IMAGE IMAGE
    *             A group of aliens is smart enough to steal someone else's
   technology, but too stupid to make any improvements on it. 

    * IMAGE IMAGE A technological development progresses from half-baked
   theory to useful implementation in fifteen minutes instead of fifteen
   months. 

      IMAGE IMAGE
    *             After twenty years of crew members being tossed around like

   or transmitted like any other data. 

      IMAGE
    *
   IMAGE
          AI software is able to bypass the security protocols of the
   operating system in which it runs. 
      IMAGE IMAGE
    *             On-board computers always know exactly how long it will
   take for the malfunction to blow up the ship. 

    * .IMAGE  Computers that exist in the far future or are alleged to be
   'cutting edge,' will demonstrate less functionality than a Commodore 64. 

      IMAGE IMAGE
    *             Two races which have never contacted each other, cannot
   speak each other's language, and cannot possibly have worked out
   compatible protocols for transmission of image and sound can nonetheless
   communicate over their ships viewscreens upon first contact. 
      IMAGE IMAGE
    *             Twentieth century firearms are abandoned, even though the
   high-tech replacement is significantly more complex to engineer, more
   costly to build, and is not appreciably deadlier, longer-ranged, or more
   accurate. 

    * IMAGE IMAGE When an extra or a minor character is shot, they fall over
   immediately dead; when a major character is shot, they either survive with
   a nasty-looking wound, or they linger long enough to utter some parting
   words. 

      IMAGE IMAGE
    *             Lasers are visible when travelling through the vacuum of
   outer space. 
      IMAGE
    *        A robot that can't climb stairs is deployed in an aread where
   stairs are common. 

    * IMAGE  A tactical system that can only deal with targets visible to the
   naked eye is still considered worthwhile. 

      IMAGE
    *
   IMAGE
          "Reversing the polarity" is the solution to virtually every
   engineering problem. 

    * IMAGE  Laser beams travel about as quickly as an arrow. 

      IMAGE
    *        Heroes/ships can dodge laser beams because the beams travel about
   as quickly as an arrow. 
      IMAGE
    *

   Alien artifacts still work after being abandoned for a million years. 

    * IMAGE IMAGE Spaceships make a whoosh as they go by. 

      IMAGE
    *

   quantities. 

      IMAGE IMAGE
    *             Stars go shooting past the spaceship as it flies through
   space. 
      IMAGE
    *        A large dose of radiation results in super powers instead of
   super tumors.

   "evolve" into a more advanced form. 

      IMAGE IMAGE

   aging, hair that has already grown changes color to match. 

    * IMAGE IMAGE A space vessel is sent out on missions before its systems
   are fully operational. 

      IMAGE
    *
   The Hero knows how to defuse the bomb, but can't remember which of two
   wires to cut. 

      IMAGE
    *

   IMAGE  When a computer is working on a difficult problem, the increased
   power requirements cause the room lights to dim or flicker. 

    * IMAGE

   Robots that despite their size and function are designed with exactly the
   same features as a human (two arms and legs, ten fingers, two eyes, same
   joint system, etc.) 

      IMAGE  Somebody lifts a car (or some other heavy object) with his bionic
    *
   arm, even though the rest of his body is normal flesh and bone and
   couldn't possibly support the load. 
      IMAGE
    *        The plans for a complicated device can be downloaded onto a 1.44
   Meg floppy. 

    * IMAGE IMAGE Increasing a computer beyond a certain level of speed,
   memory capacity, or complexity causes it to become self-aware. 

      IMAGE IMAGE Creatures capable of changing their shapes can also alter
    *
   their mass while they're at it. 
      IMAGE
    *        A hole the size of a barn is made in the hull of a space ship;
   decompression of the ship's atmosphere takes a half minute or so. 

    * IMAGE  A hole the size of a dime is made in the hull of a space ship;
   decompression of the ship's atmosphere takes a half minute or so. 

      IMAGE  A large nuclear explosion can be obtained by putting several
    *
   smaller devices together. 
      IMAGE IMAGE
    *             The same energy beam which causes rocks, buildings and
   robots to violently explode produces only a puff of smoke and a bit of
   burnt flesh and clothing when used on a living being. 

    * IMAGE IMAGE The sewers/ventilation ducts provide easy access throughout
   the city/ship/castle. 

      IMAGE
    *
   All computers have madly whirling tape drives.

      IMAGE IMAGE
    *             When something explodes in space, the shock wave is
   ring-shaped. 
      IMAGE IMAGE
    *             When an orbiting space vessel is crippled or otherwise put
   out of action, it immediately starts falling out of orbit. 

    * IMAGE IMAGE A shape-shifter whose natural form is homogenous can be
   knocked out with a blow to the head when in humanoid form. 

      IMAGE IMAGE
    *             The narrow energy beam disintegrates the entire person it
   hits, and his clothing and possessions, but doesn't leave so much as a
   stain on the chair he is sitting in or the ground he is standing on.
