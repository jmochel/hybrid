   This leads to an increased cost of healthcare, loss of productivity and an
   increase in pain and suffering.

   Or we could just work to reduce family sizes (fewer births).

   I would not have wanted to go without immunization.  I think sterilization
   of those that cannot take care of their own children should be an
   alternative.

   How does that occur?  How do you teach those that are overpopulating the
   Earth that they are causing harm to the rest of us?

   So do the environmental problems!

   The purpose of disease is to weed out weak forms.  Biology 101.

   God and Mother Nature are in charge.  We need to get out
   of the driver's seat--then all will be well.

   So, you want to solve the environmental problems by causing the same
   problems?

   Is your brain out on loan?

   Q. If immunisation is refused and infant and child mortality rises, what
   will
   be the first thing women do? I'll give you a clue - it's the same thing they
   did when infant & child mortality was higher before - have more children.
   This means more strain on the hospital, more food consumed & resources
   used by children before they die.

   OR, we could educate the world, that space isn't infinite, and get them to
   reduce the family size. This would be in conjunction with increased
   immunisation
   and medical programs, to reduce infant & child mortality (especially in
   China
   and India).

   P.S. how do you tell the drug companies - sorry, you've got to dismantle
   your
   company & stop trading?

   do not assume humans are privileged species
   if we become extinct many of the worlds probelms will disappear
   and the next intelligent species may be more intelligent

   I certainly don't assume so. But I do possess the sruvival trait, of wanting
   to care for the current environment. I don't really think many of the
   "problems"
   are "problems with the world". Homo Sapiens, as the dominant species is
   unchecked. We can exist in more ecologies than just about any other species.
   We are at the top of the food chain, most of the time. But we have to be
   aware
   of the impact of our actions, the effect we have on the world.

   This is not dis-similar to the effect that elephants have on the woodlands
   they
   have inhabited in the past.The elephants ate fruits & sweet leaves from the
   trees.
   They demolished the trees, in order to get to these things. Now many of the
   places
   they use to live are grassland. The elephants didn't know that if they
   knocked down
   all the mature trees and ate the young shoots, that they would eventually
   destroy their
   food source.

   Another problem occurs, when illness wipes out a predator. The herboviores
   that
   the predators used to feed on then breed out of control, until they starve -
   including
   the fittest of the breed, who would normally have lived OK, after escaping
   the predator.

   Homo Sapines position isn't that much different. We have evolved to the
   point where
   there are no major species that hunt us. We have used our edge in
   intelligence to

   Don't you think it's about time for us to start acting like an intelligent
   species?
