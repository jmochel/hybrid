   Gender War?  One of the most pressing problems in the world?  Are we
   having an LSD-flashback from the sixties here, friend?  I don't recall
   getting my draft notice for that one.  I would recommend repeating the
   phrase: "I must wake up from this androphobic dream" several times
   until you're back to the real world.

   The above list is too short, and therefore leaves out other very
   pressing problems, such as economic, human rights and technologically
   related themes.

   High on the list should be finding an end to the self-interested-only,
   commerce-driven terrorism inflicted by the Group of 7 upon the rest of
   the planet's poorer societies.  Economics, though an imperfect science
   like sociology and psychology, among others, could be capable of
   permitting more creative solutions to the sharing of resources and
   wealth so that all could enjoy the very basic trappings of modern
   civilization: adequate education, health care, nutrition (including
   adequate supplies of potable water) and housing, among other social
   necessities.   Economics shouldn't only be about those playing the
   stock market, getting rich at the expense (financial and otherwise) of
   others.   And, economics shouldn't have ANYTHING to do with shurking
   ecological responsibilities.

   The Middle East conflict, now over 50 years old, is only ONE specific
   squabble, unless you're overly and too narrowly construing _The
   Apocolypse of John_ .   I think the world is getting rather tired of
   it all.  Although drastic, I think the only way to throw water on that
   fire is to send in several tens of thousands of UN troops, and drag
   each disarmed side kicking and screaming into their respective
   enclaves (boundaries to be decided by a neutral, international
   committee) and then leave ONLY when everyone makes nice.  If  the UN
   made the mess in the first place, it should be the one to clean it up,
   even if that means threatening the forfeiture of parts of the 1948
   decision (or the military-backed enforcement of those sections of the
   decision conveniently abandoned since that time).    Oh, and put
   Jerusalem under permanent UN control.  That ought to account for
   solving more than half of the problem.

   As for "Dubya's" desire to start another arms race, I'm sure there are
   a lot of disappointed folks out there.  It seems to me that it would
   be better to still have the ABM Treaty in force if only to have some
   kind of moral imperative with which to hold other powers responsible
   for possible transgressions.  Yes, SALT II is a relic of the Cold War,
   but by all means, let's work on another agreement, this time to be
   signed by all nations even remotely capable of constructing weapons of
   mass destruction and leave the old one to remind us of what we have
   accomplished in the past to that effect.  And, despite assurances to
   the contrary, all weapons systems are by definition offensive as well
   as defensive, so the Hawks in the White House are full of it as they
   spout the "purely defensive nature" of the missle system for which
   they have a large collective woody.

     Are we having an LSD-flashback from the sixties here, friend? WRONG.

   additional: approx. 25.000 children die every day as a result of
   polluted drinking waters. (a day!)(how many adults dying I have no
   figures about)

   I surrendered in the Gender War and I drink bottled water; therefore
   I'm OK.  How about you, Stem?

   When I was a child my mother often told me about the starving Chinaman
   when she wanted me to eat food I was not fond of.  I guess that
   Chinaman is still starving and always will be.

   > 2) The ecological threat to the planet's stability.
   Hmm, hasn't that always been there?  Floods, fires, earthquakes,
   hurricaines, etc?

   > 3) The growing threat of conflict in the Middle East.
   Jews and Arabs will always be at each others throats.  Get used to it.

   > 4) President Bush's plans for expanding the US nuclear defense system.
   Wow, You don't like defense?  Do you think if the bad guys could
   defend themselves against our missles, they wouldn't?  Get real.

                 They are all integral parts of the planet's stability, not
   threats to it.

              Good Grief. "the bad guys"?
      The whole point of a defense system is that it allows you to attack safely
   Thus star wars would be an offensive weapon.

   So next time you're in the vicinity of a hurricaine or earthquake you
   won't feel threatened?
