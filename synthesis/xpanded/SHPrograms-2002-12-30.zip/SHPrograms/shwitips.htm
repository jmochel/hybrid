This is a friendly place where we reject the idea that there 
are inevitable forces of history that push us towards an 
inevitable historical outcome.  We refute this determinism, 
and have a lot of fun while doing so, by considering the 
different possible outcomes of historical events.  We explore 
alternate history, historical what-ifs, allohistory and 
counterfactuals</font></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Garamond">We change the past to learn about the 
consequences, for better or worse, of actions that might have been taken 
in the past, and to appreciate the role of chance and luck. But we 
make our changes in the framework of our understanding of 
the multitude of small changes that are called forces, trends, 
or developments, as well as the social and technical constraints 
of an era.

<P><FONT FACE="Garamond">
You do <b>not</b> have to be an expert historian to post a what-if 
to soc.history.what-if.  However, make sure you have a some 
understanding of the historical era of your what-if question 
before you post it.  Sections 1 and 3 of &quot;tips&quot; will help 
you design your what-if.  Section 4 will help you present your 
what-if in a way that encourages other people to discuss it.</font></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Garamond">
Try and understand the concept of <b>plausibility</b> in history. 
An alternate history <b>can</b> include dramatic and improbable events and 
still be plausible.</font></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Garamond">
Plausibility does <b>not</b> equal probability.  Rather it attempts to
resemble the process of real history. We observe that real history 
the blend of the many factors. For an alternate history to work it 
needs to recognize that change results from a wide variety of 
causes.</font></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Garamond">
<b>Every action has its consequences!</b></font></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Garamond">
First, history is made by our <b>choices</b>, by 
<b>our will to act and to persevere</b>. Muhammed, Napoleon, Buddha, 
St. Paul, Newton, Hitler, Genghis Khan, and many less noticed people 
changed history by applying their will.</font></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Garamond">
Second, consider <b>chance</b> and <b>luck</b> -- good and bad, such as the 
message on Japanese military activity that sat on a shelf over the 
weekend before the Pearl Harbor attack, or Hitler's survival running 
though the WW I trenches.
</font></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Garamond">
Third, consider the <b>progressive accumulation of many small 
events</b> that we call by names such as trends, forces, processes, 
and waves.
</font></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Garamond">
Plausibility is related to probability in that it captures the
summation of all of these results.  For example if it took six
weeks to sail from Acapulco to Manilla in a Galleon in fair weather 
and the fastest recorded trip was four weeks, it is not plausible 
to have an alternate history depend on a usual sailing time of four weeks.
</font></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Garamond">
It is plausible to have improbable events, but not an endless series
of them.  In real history the sequence for "want of of a nail the shoe
was lost, for want of a shoe the horse was lost, for want of a horse
the battle was lost, for want of a battle the empire was lost" just
does not happen. At one stage or antoher someone uses a substitute.
</font></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Garamond">
Plausibility is also related to feasibility. A standard example is
the Roman steam engine. It is very unlikely that the Romans would have any
interest in developing a steam engine. It is of primary value as a labor
saving machine.  Even if a Roman decided to make one, he could not just
go and throw one together at his villa. Our inventive Roman could
not make a steam engine without having the ability to do metal fabrication,
machining and instrumentation similar to that of 18th century Europe.
It took hundreds of years of trial and error to produce these necessary
preceding technologies. Consider just one of them, a boring mill to
manufacture cylinders. This technology was developed in Europe to make
better cannon. So Roman development of a working steam engine--as opposed
to a ball that spins by venting steam--would have depended on
improving their seige machinery by developing something that fired through
tubes. Gunpowder is not essential. The key is precision matching of the tube
and projectile diameters.
</font></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Garamond">
Plausiblity is also related to the speed at which societies absorb
change. We have  regular elections and respect the results.  This took
hundreds of years to be accepted as the way of legitizing power. It
would not be plausible to have Ferdinand and Isablella chuck the
Inquistion and legitimate their power by popular election.
</font></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Garamond">
Plausibility also sums up other elements, which are described in 
this Posting &quot;Tips&quot; FAQ.
</font></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Garamond">
As for alternate history fiction, most of it is not very plausible 
but we accept it where it creates a persuasive illusion of a world.
</font></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Garamond">
Respect our Charter by not discussing adventures in published 
fictional worlds (see section 2 of &quot;tips&quot;), or revisionist 
history, such as Holocaust denial, (see section 5, of &quot;tips,&quot; 
which will also help you to avoid other problems.</font></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Garamond">
1.01 If your newsreader can sort by thread, scan the list 
of soc.history.what-if subjects and start with a few 
that match your interests, whether they are the Normans 
fail to conquer England or a replay of World War II. 
Beware, though, there are several cranks around.  If 
you read a post that attacks the poster personally 
rather than the ideas, ignore it.  If you see several 
objectionable posts from the same person, ignore 
discussions that involve that person.</font></P>

1.03 Soc.history.what-if was created by people who wanted a 
forum to examine real history and see how things might
have developed differently if people had made other 
decisions or had different luck at a historical "point 
of departure" (POD)  This is called alternate history (AH), 
allohistory, counterfactual history, or uchronia. </font></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Garamond">
1.04 AH topics start with a what-if (WI), usually in the form 
of a &quot;what-if&quot; question that calls for an answer that 
explains how history would have been different from real 
history to cause the change at the POD and explains how 
the AH would then differ from real history after the POD. 
The POD can be a battle, an election, the premature death 
of a key person, the birth of a breakthrough person when during 
an uneventful period in real history, a scientific discovery, 
or anything else of historic importance.</font></P>

<h2><a name="S2">2. Published alternate history fiction</a> </h2>
<h3><a name="S2.01">Charter prohibits discussion of adventures in published 
fictional worlds</a> </h3>

<P><FONT FACE="Garamond">
2.01 Our Charter prohibits discussion of adventures in published 
fictional worlds, such as <b><i>Draka</b></i> or <b><i>Starship Troopers.</b></i> 
The following should help you distinguish what is appropriate 
for discussion on soc.history.what-if from what should be posted 
to rec.arts.sf.written:</font></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Garamond">
<blockquote>
<li>If you want to discuss a published AH story, post to 
   rec.arts.sf.written <b>only</b>.  However, there is a limited 
   exemption for speculation about how the history created in 
   the published story would work as an alternate history.  
   This includes discussing history from the individualist 
   perspective of the real world persons that may appear in 
   a published AH, and the characters of the individuals who 
   made history. For example we can take the WI that the South 
   won the US civil war in the manner described in Mr. Turtledove's 
   <b><i>How Few Remain</b></i>, and we could discuss how this would affect 
   Abe Lincoln.  Our discussion could include the plausibility of 
   Turtledove's speculation that Lincoln's actions would lead 
   Theodore Roosevelt to accuse him Lincoln being a Red Marxist. 
   Similarly we can discuss arguments that <b><i>How Few Remain</b></i>
   misinterpreted Blaine's character and made him take historical 
   actions that he could not have taken in a plausible AH.</font></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Garamond">
<li>The authors of successful AH fiction, such as Mr. Turtledove 
   or Mr. Stirling, are sometimes very knowlegeable about the 
   real history of the eras covered by their stories.  They 
   choose outcomes that they know are implausible because these 
   are the ones with maximum dramatic impact. For this reason 
   alone their published AH fiction is better discussed in 
   rec.arts.sf.written rather than soc.history.what-if. 
   There is also a Draka fan page at 
   http://www.mindspring.com/~atalbott/index.html</font></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Garamond">
<li>There is general consensus that the Draka history is one of the 
   best-developed published alternate histories, which overcomes 
   the fact that it is very improbable in its historical 
   development.  However it is implausible mainly because of 
   the improbability that the society could work if it actually 
   came into existence.  The uniformity of Draka belief, their 
   high level of civic responsibility, and irresistable 
   slave-training techniques are very unlikely to evolve from 
   the Draka roots as Southern slaveholders. Nor is the docility 
   of the slave culture plausible.</font></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Garamond">
<li>If you want to discuss how you enjoyed or detested the story, 
   and fiction specifics, such as the degree of dramatic tension, 
   the amount of &quot;enjoyably nasty stuff,&quot; plot resolution by a 
   <i>deus ex machina</i>, "how faithful the movie was to the book, 
   political correctness of the story or movie, the techniques 
   the author uses to develop the character of a fictional person, 
   such as by writing from a first person or third person 
   viewpoint, or colorful description of personal quirks, you 
   should all be post to rec.arts.sf.written.</font></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Garamond">
<li>Do <b>not</b> cross-post from soc.history.what-if to 
   rec.arts.sf.written.  See section 5 of &quot;tips&quot; for more on 
   cross-posting.</font></P>

<h2><a name="S3">3. Creating your own alternative 
history (AH)</a> </h2>
<h3><a name="S3.01">
Three basic techniques for creating an AH </a> </h3>

<P><FONT FACE="Garamond">
3.01 Set out some circumstances for your proposed what-if 
and sketch out a few thoughts on what <b>you</b> think might 
happen if the what-if occured. There are two basic 
techniques for creating an AH:</font></P>
<blockquote>
<P><FONT FACE="Garamond">
<li>Reverse-engineer: write backwards. If you conceive of 
   a social arrangenment, such as a British North America 
   east of the Mississipi during the 19th century, all you
   have to do is figure out the series of events that 
   would have led from your POD, in this case probably no 
   American Revolution, or a failed one, to your British 
   North America of 1876.</font></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Garamond">
<li>Or you could postulate a POD and figure out what changes 
   in history would be necessary for a change to occur. 
   For example, the Japanese closed their world to outside 
   influences starting in the 17th century, and this isolation 
   lasted until the Americans forced them to open to foreign 
   trade in the 19th century. What changes in history would be 
   needed for the Japanese to remain open to the world?</font></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Garamond">
<li>Consider POD's <b>other</b> than big changes such as who 
   won or lost the usually recognized decisive battle. AH design 
   can be most satisfying if you go further back in history and 
   make a fairly small change.  For example the big battle method 
   of keeping the U.S. in the British Empire would be to have 
   the British win the battle of Saratoga. But this is very late 
   in the movement towards independence.  It is still likely that 
   as the thirteen colonies recovered from the defeat they would 
   revert, sooner or later, to their common efforts to win 
   independence.  The way to have kept the British colonies in the 
   empire would have been to have blocked the initial stages 
   of a single independence movement.  An effective POD would 
   make Britain give each colony a separate and independent 
   legislative body by perhaps 1770, with each having its own 
   tax-raising power.  This was long <b>before</b> the colonies  
   united to overthrow British rule. This POD would &quot;divide 
   and conquer.&quot; Britain would thus have empowered each colony to set 
   its own domestic policy, in the framework of British foreign and 
   imperial policy. As each colony separately developed it would have less 
   and less in common with the other colonies and an independent 
   unified state would be unlikely to develop because each state 
   had a vested interest in maintaining its relative independence.</font></P>

<h4><a name="S3.02atlas">Atlas</a> </h4>

<P><FONT FACE="Garamond">
<li>Atlas. Borders change in history. It is very helpful to look 
   a map that shows the names and extent of countries at the 
   ime of your POD. A good historical atlas for this purpose is 
   <b><i>The Harper Atlas of World History</b></i>, (William 
   Collins Sons & Co. Ltd., 1987). The format is a series of 
   double page presentations on specific topics with from one to 
   ten simplified maps showing borders, key names, and major 
   changes. A short text explains the maps. A detailed chonology
   matches the maps.  Covers all regions of the world. This is the 
   English translation of <b><i>Le grand livre de l'histoire du monde; 
   atlas historique</b></i>, edited by Pierre Vidal-Naquet with text 
   by about 60 persons(Paris; France Loisirs, 1986) ISBN 2.7242.3083.3.  
   Inspired by the historical concept of Braudel, history as the 
   details of all aspects of life.</font></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Garamond">
<li>Atlas. <b><i>The Times Atlas of World History</b></i>, 4th ed., edited by 
   Geoffrey Barraclough (Times Books, Harper Collins Publishers, 
   London, Hammond Incorporated, Maplewood, NJ;1993) 
   ISBN 0-7230-0534-6.  First published in 1978.  Any edition is 
   suitable.  More general thematic treatment of eras than 
   Harper.  An excellent way for you to gain an overall 
   understanding of an era and the changes that can be made in it. 
   My only reservation is that it persists in using Wade-Giles 
   instead of pinyin romanized Chinese names.</font></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Garamond">
<li>Atlas. <b><i>The Anchor Atlas of World History</b></i>, maps facing 
   chronologies.  It is 2 paperback volumes of about 300 pages
   each.  Standard-sized paperbacks; physically easy to handle, 
   compared to a normal atlas, though the maps are quite small. 
   [deserves more comment]</font></P>

<li>Atlas. Colin McEvedy, <b><i>Penguin Atlas of Ancient History</b></i>, 
   <b><i>Penguin Atlas of Medieval History</b></i>,
   <b><i>Penguin Atlas of Modern History</b></i>,
   <b><i>Penguin Atlas of Recent History</b></i>. Maps are series of 
   overviews of Europe and West Asia, or Europe alone, with a few 
   World maps. A short text explains each map.  Focus almost 
   exclusively on Europe and West Asia. Landscape format double size
   paperbacks; physically easy to handle, compared to a normal 
   atlas. Very handy for quick reference.

   might change this by using a POD based on the idea that the 
   Greeks and Romans they were slave owning societies, which
   produced a chronic labor surplus that served as a disincentive to
   seeking labor saving improvements; or a POD to change their 
   attitude of cultural superiority, which made them downplay the 
   value of things that they did not develop themselves.</font></P>

   system of measurements -- length, width, volume -- based on 
   the musical pitches of bells. By contrast the modern metric 
   system began with the Englightenment idea of replacing the 
   measure of the distance between the kings nose and fingertip 
   (the yard) with a crude measure of of the circumferance of 
   world, divided by a number that would yield an answer about 
   the same length as the yard. Western measures displaced the 
   Chinese measures based on harmonic sounds. But when you think 
   about it, physics and engineering based on harmonic measures 
   could have progressed directly to measuring distance by the
   frequency of light waves, as we do now, and could have skipped 
   much of the instrumentation based development of Western 
   measurement.</font></P>

<li>Ideas. Disease. 
<b><i>Plagues and Peoples</b></i> by William H. McNeill.  A top 
   historian's readable overview of disease and history.  How 
   plagues hit the late Roman Empire, stalled Alexander's 
   invasion of India, required cities to rely on migration from 
   rural areas to maintain their populations.
   For a current assessment of plagues by a biology professor see 
 <b><i>Yellow Fever, Black Goddess: The Coevolution of People and 
   Plagues</b></i>, by Christopher Wills (Addison-Wesley Pub Co, 
   1997).  Both McNeill and Wills argue that evolution will 
   uniformly favor benign pathogens over the long term. Because 
   parasites need hosts to survive, virulent pathogens would be 
   at an evolutionary disadvantage. Pathogens, such as Yersinia 
   pestis, the bacterium that causes bubonic plague, survive only 
   in specialized conditions and are highly vulnerable to things 
   that disturb its universe, which explains why plague outbreaks 
   do not last.  But there is a caveat for McNeill and Wills. 
   They limit their definition of plague to something that 
   eventually subsides.  The most dramatic examples are the 
   pandemics such as the Black Death of the 6th, 14th and 17th 
   centuries and the Influenza of 1918. But there are diseases 
   that kill in large numbers for millennia.  A contrary view is 
   that there are perpetual plagues where the particulars of 
   transmission favor both high virulence and high frequency of 
   infection. For example areas where mosquito density is 
   perpetually high, enable Plasmodium falciparum malaria to kill 
   many people, year after year. The AH designer should consider 
   the effects of these perpetual plagues diseases as well as 
   sporatic ones.  Such perpetual plagues blocked Western 
   exploitation of Africa for centuries until modern medicine and 
   provided some protection. For views that contrast with McNeil 
   and Wills see a book by another biology professor, Paul Ewald,

   0-521-55427-6  ISBN  0-521-63990-5 Pbk. A thesis that 
   the West's great distinction was to meld mathematics and
   measurement into a mindset -- to use quantification to 
   understand everything material within time and space; to 
   measure reality.  Argues that quantification explains how the 
   West leaped from a sub-Euclidean legacy to the universe 
   Galileo describes, to a culture that spawned navigation, 
   astronomy, cartography, commercial and banking procedures and 
   practical and theoretical mathematics.  This change spread 
   through the psyche--mentalité--of the West.  It became the 
   way of thinking of the world that gave the West decisively 
   important administrative, commercial, industrial and military 
   skills not developed in other Societies. This suggests AH's in

<li>Ideas. <b><i>The Colonizer's Model of the World</b></i>, J.M. Blaut. 
   A thesis that that the rise of Europe to modernity and world

   unbalanced the Eurasian economic system in favour of 
   Europe, rather than due to some unique European quality of 
   race, environment, culture, mind, or spirit, and that progress
   for the rest of the world results from the diffusion of 
   European civilization.  Blaut argues the diffusionist doctrine 
   is the world model constructed by Europeans to explain, justify, 
   and assist their colonial expansion.  This suggests AH's in 
   which one of the other major Societies, such as Islam or 
   China, discover and exploit the Americas before the Europeans. 
   Use Blaut's thesis with caution.  European sea dominance came

<li>Ideas. Annales historians, Braudel, Darnton, Ladurie, Schama. 
   Since about 1929 Annales historians have rejected both 
   classical political history, which assumes common people live 
   in history but do not make history and that political ideas 
   govern economic behavior; and the Procrustean bed of any 
   determinist big theory, such as Marx. A synthesis of styles 
   and specialities, focused on data from primary documents, 
   closely checked rather than accepted as prima facie true and 
   complete.  Annalists search for long term historical dynamics, 
   without assuming it must be economic interest, religious 
   ideology, or dynastic ambitions of royal dynasties.  I highly 
   recommend many of the Annales books to AH researchers for their 
   fascinating detail and high quality writing. The top Annales 
   historian was Fernand Braudel, <b><i>The Mediterranean</b></i>

   perspectives on human history which, among other things offer 
   recurrent motifs such as &quot;the irrigation system

   Humans have been destroying the environment since prehistoric 
   times.  Many examples of destruction for AH designers to 
   change.  A simple formula for disaster: successful Societies
   produce surplus food which allows the rise of culture, civil and
   military hierarchies. These institutions vastly increase demands on
   the ecosystem for food and energy that outstrip the local ecosystem's
   ability to sustain. What follows is an inevitable downward cycle of
   diminishing returns resulting from over-irrigation of lands, leading
   to rising of water tables and the salinization of the land and a
   consequent fall in the production of the agricultural output leading
   to eventual shortfalls in surpluses, starvation and the demise of the
   culture. Other examples: deforestation, extermination of species. </font></P>

<li>Ideas. Environmental determinism, biogeography. Jared Diamond, 
   <b><i>Guns, Germs and Steel</b></i>, (W.W. Norton & Co, 1997, ISBN 
   0-224-03809-5). 
   Western Society defeated its competitors because geography gave it 
   diverse flora and fauna.  Eurasia had more types of plants and 
   large animals to domesticate than other regions. Ambitious 
   broad brush human history since the Ice Age in the context of 
   geography, demography, and ecological happenstance.  Eurasia has 
   geography better than other regions for to farming, domestication 
   of animals, and information flow.  It developed populous cultures 
   with complex government and communication -- and increased 
   resistance to disease. Societies that gained a head start in
   producing food would overpower preliterate ones. Domestication of 
   animals made Eurasians resistant to these germs that they later 
   spread in epidemic proportions in their voyagesof discovery. 
   Diamonds's thesis is a &quot;positive feedback 
   loop&quot; from farming, domestication, population density, to 
   innovation.  Why did peoples of some regions fail to domesticate 
   plants? Why were most big wild mammal species never domesticated?
   Why did food production spread at different rates on different 
   continents? The final chapter, &quot;The Future of History as 
   a Science,&quot; is almost an AH factory. It argues that students 
   of humanity have examples and &quot;natural experiments&quot; to 
   make comparisons. For example, after the 15th century fragmented 
   Europe harnessed competitive innovation in ways that over-unified 
   China did not. Christendom adopted the wheel, the key machine 
   element, while the Islamic Society discarded it</font></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Garamond"> 
<li>Ideas. Evolution and &quot;biological determinism&quot; 
   This category of books provides many unexpected examples and 
   illustrations that you can adapt to explain AH changes. 
   Jared Diamond, <b><i>The Rise and Fall of the Third 
   Chimpanzee</b></i> (ISBN 0 09 991380 1). But how do we reconcile the 
   idea of evolution by natural selection relentlessly favoring 
   self-interest, for example Dawkins, </b></i>The Selfish Gene</b></i>, 
   with the complex societies developed by human beings and the 
   abundance of human cooperative spirit? For an answer read Matt 
   Ridley, <b><i>The Origins of Virtue: Human Instincts and the 
   Evolution of Cooperation</b></i>,  (Viking Penguin, 1997, ISBN 
   0670874493). Matt Ridley summarizes his book. It &quot;is about the 
   billion-year coagulation of our genes into cooperative teams, 
   the million-year coagulation of our ancestors into cooperative 
   societies, and the thousand-year coagulation of ideas about 
   society and its origins.&quot; He suggests a new paradox: &quot;Our 
   minds have been built by selfish genes, but they have been 
   built to be social, trustworthy and cooperative.&quot; 
   The AH designer will find inspiration in examples of societies 
   built upon voluntary exchange of goods, information, fortune 
   and power between free individuals -- trust, mutuality and 
   reciprocity -- before authoritarian government suppressed the 
   arrangements. Merchant guilds. Merchant communities in 
   North Italy (which was spared the strong monarchies and 
   godfathers of the South). Trade precedes law. Modern 
   commercial law was invented and enforced by merchants to 
   facilitate trade in the 11th century.  Merchants in a foreign 
   country had no recourse to their prince if cheated and no 
   confidence that the same standards applied there as at home. 
   Merchants voluntarily produced, voluntarily adjudicated and 
   voluntarily enforced the <b><i>lex mercatoria</b></i>.  It 
   evolved. Natural selection allowed good customs and ways of 
   settling disputes to drive out inferior ones. By the 12th century 
   it provided substantial protection. But the adapability of the 
   system was lost as goverments increased their power and froze 
   the arrangements into laws enforced by the state.  Merchants have 
   made repeated attempts to bypass the congested courts by 
   commercial arbitration. 
   The collapse of community spirit in the last few decades, and 
   the erosion of civic virtue, is caused not by the the spread 
   and encouragement of greed but by the spread of Levitathan, the 
   powerful state that makes no bargain with the citizen to take 
   joint responsibility for civic order, engenders in the citizen 
   no obligation, duty or pride, and imposes obedience instead. 
   Thus the citizen, treated as an naughty child, behaves like 
   one.  Examples of where authority replaced reciprocity and 
   the sense of community failed. Ineffective welfare state 
   based on condensation replaced effective community 
   institutions. Material improvement is the result of new 
   technology, not government. Socially the deterioration is 
   marked &quot;for St Augustine the source of social order 
   lay in the teachings of Christ. For Hobbes it lay in the 
   sovereign. For Lenin it lay in the party. They were all wrong. 
   The roots of social order are in our heads, where we possess the 
   instincitve capacities for creating not a perfectly harmonious 
   and virtuous society, but a better one than we have at present.&quot;
   The AH designer should recognize that the medieval vassal and 
   the industrial age factory worker had no freedom to build a 
   society based on trust and reciprocity between equals in a 
   Society dominated by the heirarchical authority of prince and 
   church, aristocratic or industrial system. But there are many 
   other opportunities to apply the thesis that government does 
   not impose virtue on inherently evil people, which is the thesis of 
   Hobbes' Leviathan and contemporary liberals.   
   &quot;We are not so nasty that they need to be tamed by intrusive 
   government, nor so nice that intrusive government does not 
   bring out the worst in us, both as its employees and as its 
   clients.&quot; History provides many POD's where a society 
   could have developed alternatives to a &quot;government that 
   dictates the minutist details of life and squats like a giant 
   flea upon the back of the nation.&quot;</font></P>

3.03 Plausibility, probability, the unexpected, luck and chance.</font></P>

<blockquote>
<P><FONT FACE="Garamond">
<li>You should do some sort of reality check on your POD and AH. 
   It is not plausible to propose that the Roman Empire survives 
   almost unchanged to the present day, with the exception that 
   the Imperial guards use machine guns and some totalitarian 
   techniques.</font></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Garamond">
<li>&quot;Plausible&quot; does not mean just the most &quot;probable&quot; outcome of 
   a change in history.  You can write a plausible AH showing 
   major changes caused by the actions of a person of improbable 
   origin. This has happened in real history. Consider Napoleon, 
   a Corsican who might not even have been French if there had 
   been slight changes in history a few years before he was born.</font></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Garamond">
<li>To use a person who did not exist in real history to do 
   improbable things, all you need to do is check that the 
   cultural, socio-political and technological circumstances were 
   so that such a person could make the changes.  Indeed, for a 
   plausible AH extending more than a few years beyond the POD, 
   you <b>should</b>, like real history, include some unexpected 
   world-altering individuals, and develop the socio-political 
   environment that enables their actions to be believable.</font></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Garamond">
<li>Also, don't forget the role of <b>chance</b> and <b>luck</b> in real 
   history. A plausible AH will include some of these elements.  
   For example a storm blows an attack fleet off course, a major 
   religious leader falls down the stairs and dies before 
   delivering the word of God.  Real history also has the message on
   Japanese military activity that sat on a shelf over the weekend before

Plausibility checklist </a> </h3>

<P><FONT FACE="Garamond">
3.04 Checking the plausibility of your AH is mostly common sense.  
However you might want to think about a few specific checks 
on it. These could include:</font></P>

<blockquote>
<P><FONT FACE="Garamond">
<li>An attempt to capture the socio-political and technological 
   evolution of the era.</font></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Garamond">
<li>Avoiding extremes that contradict the socio-political and 
   technological realities of the era.  For example, an empire 
   that lasts virtually forever, like year 2000 Rome, a &quot;super 
   superior empire&quot; like the ficitional Draka who make no 
   mistakes (stirring fiction but not very plausible), or a 
   people rising from the ashes of defeat to dominate the 
   world. If your AH claims any of these, you are going to have 
   a lot of work to create a plausible explanation.  Similarly,
   you can create a good looking AH empire or country on the map. 
   But to make it plausible, you need to apply the same factors 
   that made it possible for empires and countries to exist in 
   real history.</font></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Garamond">
<li>Avoiding an isolated dramatic event, in isolation from 
   socio-political and technological changes, as the means of 
   creating major changes. For example Napoleon conquered much 
   of Europe.  Your AH would be implausible if you put a 
   Napoleon syle Emperor in France 50 years earlier and said 
   he maide these conquests.  The AH would lack the essential 
   context of revolutionary popular enthusiasm and changes such 
   as the Levee en Masse.</font></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Garamond">
<li>Avoiding the &quot;easy erase&quot; trap of removing something from 
   real history that was the natural result of socio-political 
   and technological developments.  For example having an empire 
   collapse without apparent reason or not forming, despite 
   the presence of factors that make this by far the easiest 
   course of action for people to take.</font></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Garamond">
<li>Avoiding instant technology which is widely adopted despite 
   incompatable social context.  For example having Roman 
   steam engines without preparing the way with metallugry and 
   machining skills that need to preceed the device, and without 
   social changes to to the cheap labor market that made the 
   Romans uniterested in labor saving technology.</font></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Garamond">
<li>Recognizing that if your AH covers more than a few years after 
   your POD there will be a progressive accumulation of changes 
   in peoples beliefs, socio-political and economic activities, 
   and technology.</font></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Garamond">
<li>Recognizing that if you use historical personalities in your 
   AH, they are plausible if they were born before the POD, but 
   increasingly implausible as the time increases between the 
   POD and their birth, with the implausibility increasing as 
   their ancestors are directly related to the changes caused 
   by the POD. In fiction we can use Nixon as a car salesman 
   as a joke, for an AH of British America, but its not 
   plausible at all.</font></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Garamond">
<li>Recognizing that we can discuss AH most clearly when we 
   look at just a few years after a POD.  When we go beyond that 
   we have no idea what is plausible, except that it makes 
   some logical sense to see AH as changed by a &quot;ripple effect&quot; 
   of accumulated micro changes after the POD.  A POD in 
   modern high-communication society will propagate very 
   rapidly. But the rate slows as we look further back in 
   history, until we reach the pre-electronic world where local 
   cultures were mainly isolated from the outside.</font></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Garamond">
<li>Recognizing when the &quot;ripple effect&quot; is strong.  This would 
   include eras when the composition of the elite population 
   has direct consequences on politics. History is full of wars 
   caused by dynastic disputes, and elites elbowing for more 
   power.  These events are most sensitive to microchange effects.  
   During the pre-modern era of Latin Christiandom claimants to 
   dynastic titles fought wars to their support their claims. The 
   failure to have a male child could plunge society into war and 
   lead to major shifts in political control. Its fun to write 
   these AH's but they can soon become very complex. After the 
   17th century there was a gradual shift to sovereignty based on 
   support of the population, and wars became more closely related 
   to national interests, which reduced this "ripple effect."</font></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Garamond">
<li>Applying a rational concept of historical change. AFAIK nobody 
   has ever been to an alternate world. We can make all sorts of 
   speculation about a &quot;ripple effect&quot; producing explosive changes, 
   because of chaos theory etc.  But the only speculations of any 
   possible value to us are those that are bounded by rationality. 
   When we look at real history we observe that most changes are 
   incremental rather than explosive, and can be explained by the 
   effects of the interaction of many individual decisions.  
   Human nature makes most people reasonably predictable in their 
   behavior. They earn a living, have children etc. Personalities 
   rarely radically transform.  Napoleon had a personality that 
   needed to gamble all on the single chance and was compelled to 
   provide kingships for his relatives even when this sabotaged 
   public support for the new governments.  If we looked at him 
   after a POD he would still have this personality, rather than a 
   different one, such as where he transformed into a cautious 
   conserver of his gains who built popular support for new kings 
   with local roots. Technology permits some things at a 
   particular time but not others.  An ancient Roman tinkerer 
   could not invent a steam engine one summer in the back room of 
   a villa and revolutionize Roman industry.</font></P>

historical plausibility, as it is the creation of a <b>mood</b> 
of living in an AH world.  The fictional AH's that work best, 
such as <b><i>Fatherland</b></i>, <b><i>The Man in the High Castle</b></i>, <b><i>Bring the

fictional AH's is to function as part of an interesting story. 
This can conflict conflict with the aim of creating a plausible

What is plausible technological change?</a> </h3>

<P><FONT FACE="Garamond">
3.11 Technological change, as mentioned above, should be 
plausible. However, you <b>can</b> do a plausible AH where science and 
technology differ considerably from the real world.  Bear in mind 
that changes in science and technology are very complex.  Nothing 
happens in isolation.  A change in science or technology at a POD 
requires changes <b>before</b> the POD that make it possible for the 
change to work.  For example you can't introduce a steam engine 
without first showing a history of preceding technological 
development in metal fabrication, machining and instrumentation. 
In addition to showing the development of the knowledge required 
to make a science or technology change, your AH should deal with 
the natural consequences of the change, including further 
discoveries and applications.  If a society invents and adopts 
steam engines, power source development will <b>not</b> stop there, 
even if it does not follow the pattern of real history. Here are 
some tips to help your technological arguments.</font></P>

<blockquote>
<P><FONT FACE="Garamond">
<li>Similar societies have about the same rate of technological 
   change. A single discovery, no matter how fundamental, will 
   usually fail to transform a the long-term development of a 
   society. A dramatic change in a society's rate of technological 
   development needs a dramatic change in society itself.  You can 
   achieve this by designing an AH where the working population 
   drops and there is a demand for labor saving machines, as it 
   did in Europe in the 14th century.  Or you can replace a 
   restrictive government that discourages entrepreneurialism and 
   science, such as inquisitorial Spain, with a one that encourages 
   dynamic centers of learning, as occurred in Holland in the 17th 
   century. Or you can inject new wealth into a society ready to 
   innovate to make profits, as occurred in England in the 18th 
   century.</font></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Garamond">
<li>However, it is much easier to design an AH to retard rather 
   than advance the rate of technological change.  The bulk of 
   technology relies on previous discoveries being completed.  
   A big speedup of a specific technology will hit barriers as 
   it runs beyond the prerequisite components that need to be 
   developed by other technologies. In real history many "crash 
   projects" have failed because they have run beyond available 
   inputs.  The project members then have to develop an 
   incredible range of related technologies before they can 
   advance in the project.  A project that attempts to create a 
   wide range of technologies quickly reaches the point of 
   diminishing returns fairly quickly. Consider the simple 
   example of the person in a Roman villa inventing a steam 
   engine.  They have to develop the full range of technologies 
   for making high quality steel, boring cylinders (a technology 
   developed in real history to bore cannons), making regulatory 
   controls (a technology developed by scientists in real history ]
   to develop instrumentation to measure the real world) etc. The 
   problem of a technology before its time is becomes worse as the 
   technologies become more sophisticated.</font></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Garamond">
<li>As returns diminish, wastage increases. A society with a huge 
   increase in its research budget must be able to afford to throw 
   away a lot of money. An unavoidable economic consequence of 
   major crash research programs (those that consume a significant 
   share of Gross National Product, a measure of economic wealth) 
   as demonstrated by military research during the Cold War, is 
   that they drain money from the economy, and lower economic 
   growth.</font></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Garamond">
<li>It's difficult to design an AH that plausibly &quot;deletes&quot; a 
   technology entirely is hard. It is rarely sufficient to remove 
   the person credited with a discovery. Except in ancient times, 
   when there was little technological change anyway, discoveries 
   are usually the result of the work of many people. Also, most
   of the major scientific and technological discoveries were the 
   evident goals to people who had observed previous development. 
   The achievement of most discoveries is by perseverance in 
   seeking to reach these goals. As time after the previous 
   development increases, the nature of the next discovery 
   becomes more and more obvious. Your AH can delay discoveries, 
   but the longer you delay them, the more likely the it is that 
   some researcher will make the breakthrough.</font></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Garamond">
<li>Many technologies have alternatives.  This is particularly 
   so for core technologies such as power generation, electronics, 
   weapons, fuels, and transport and propulsion systems for land, 
   air, sea and space. For example, in real history petroleum 
   replaced coal as the major fuel because it was more efficient 
   and less costly. If the oil industry had been delayed we would 
   have developed alternatives, such as alcohol fueled engines. 
   They have lower performance but are still useful enough for
   to develop an early 20th century level auto industry. As 
   petroleum was developed as a source for gasoline, it would 
   displace alcohol fueled engines. A key point is that the fact 
   that a certain technology dominates usage in real history 
   usually means that the alternatives are more costly and less 
   efficient, rather than non-existent.</font></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Garamond">
<li>Wishful thinking does not make a feasible technology. An AH 
   based on a theoretically possible technology can fail if it is 
   not practically feasible. There are many &quot;maybe&quot; technologies, 
   such as Maglev trains, turbine autos, and dynasoar space 
   planes, that were never seriously implemented in real history
   because they would worked poorer and were more costly than 
   their optimistic supporters predicted, or would take an 
   excessive development time and money before the problems could 
   be solved and they could be incorporated into working 
   real-world systems. Dream technology for space travel or 
   computers that would have made an AH better than the real 
   world is particularly suspect.  Before you incorporate dream 
   technology in your AH, consider the credibility of its 
   advocates. Often they have an axe to grind with the owners of 
   the existing technology and have a vested interest in the 
   dream technology.  Or they are simply impractical dreamers who 
   ignore the difficulties inherent in the technology. The 
   technologies used in the real world, whether today or 2000 
   years ago, are the ones which met the practical needs of 
   society.  When you find a technology that was not used in real 
   history, find the reason why it was not used.  If you want to 
   introduce the technology, design your AH so that reason 
   does not exist.  For example if you want a Roman steam engine, 
   you will have to create demand for labor saving machinery. 
   You would have to transform Roman society from one of cheap 
   labor to one of labor shortage.  An initial step would be to 
   abolish slavery.  However this is easier said than done, and 
   you would also need to make a lot of other social changes.</font></P>

Ancient technolology </a> </h3>

<P><FONT FACE="Garamond">
3.12 Ancient technolology.  An early, and vivid fictional AH 
proposed that as an alternative to the collapse of the Roman 
Empire and the onset of the "Dark Ages" a time-traveller 
would arrive in Rome and introduced twentieth century technology.  
This was L. Sprague de Camp's 1939 novel, </I></B>Lest Darkness 
Fall.</I></B> The hero introduces one invention after another, 
transforms Rome and prevents the Fall.  But you can make your 
what-if operate within the realm of plausibility. Consider 
the classic AH of the Roman steam engine:</font></P>

<blockquote>
<P><FONT FACE="Garamond">
<li>The Romans were good at technological development, by taking 
   existing basic concepts and improving them where it was 
   sufficiently desired and cost-effective.  However they were not 
   technical innovators.</font></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Garamond">
<li>Would the Romans be interested in developing a steam 
   engine. It is of primary value as a labor saving machine. 
   But the romans had a glut of slaves and Plebs. Consider 
   cost-effectivness.  Supply and demand meant that
   there was nothing to be gained by developing machinery
   for anything except toys and spectacles (temple doors etc).
   The Romans were practical to the extreme and limited R&D
   to where they needed it--cement, good plumbing (great baths
   are practical from the point of view of the user).</font></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Garamond">
<li>Until the mid-19th century, with the advances in Chemistry, 
   technology has developed independently of science.  Practical 
   measurements and iterative tests--often extremely unsafe--were 
   used instead of mathematical modelling to develop things such
   as early cannon and steam engines.   Check out how, for
   example, James Watt perfected the steam engine (1775).</font></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Garamond">
<li>The geometry that the Romans used in their construction was
   sufficient for this project.  They knew about Euclid's
   "Elements" of geometry and there was no shortage of Greek
   teachers to explain the finer points.</font></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Garamond">
<li>However, it would have been beyond Roman ability to make 
   a working steam engine until they developed a boring mill 
   to manufacture cylinders.  This technology was developed in
   Europe to make better cannon.  So Roman development of a 
   working steam engine--as opposed to a Hero's ball that spins 
   by venting steam--would have depended on improving their
   seige machinery by developing something that fired through
   tubes.  Gunpowder is not essential.  The key is precision
   matching of the tube and projectile diameters.  Seems like
   there is a possibility here for a good AH!</font></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Garamond">
<li>The creative AH designer might find another reason for the 
   Romans to develop a boring mill than to make cannon.</font></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Garamond"> 
<li>Alternatively, the AH designer might have the Romans stick 
   to rotation, and develop a steam turbine. However, this would 
   have its own requirements: including balancing and reliable, 
   effective bearings.</font></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Garamond">
<li>Either way, they'd have to perfect fairly high-quality steel.</font></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Garamond">
<li>Given several centuries the Romans could solve these problems. 
   But the AH designer must motivate the Romans to do so by 
   making labor much more expensive relative to machinery.</font></P>

the 9th to 13th centuries was a rare combination of means and 
opportunity.  Al-Khwarizmi, Ibn Sina, Ibn al-Haitham are examples

researches were not developed by later generations because of a 
whole complex of reasons, ranging from the Mongol/Timurid 
shattering of the intellectual culture in Bagdhad, to increasing

<h3><a name="S3.14">
Early Modern Western science and technology </a> </h3>

<P><FONT FACE="Garamond">
3.14 Early Modern Western science and technology.  My impression has been for 
some time that quantification is the key to understanding why the 
West developed modern science and technology while neither Islam 
nor China did.  I note in this regard a recent book by Alfred W. 
Crosby, <b><i>The Measure of Reality: Quantification and Western 
Society, 1250-1600</b></i> (see my mini review in section 3.02) argues 
along somewhat similar lines.</font></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Garamond">
3.15 In particular I argue that analytic geometry, and 
instrumentation are key factors in Europe's scientific revolution.
First, analytic geometry:</font></P>

<blockquote>
<P><FONT FACE="Garamond">
<li>As early as the third century A.D. the Chinese developed 
   geometrical propositions in algebraic form and described 
   geometrical figures by algebraic equations.  The Muslims 
   acquired these techniques when al-Khwarizmi was the Kalif's 
   ambassador to Khazaria.</font></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Garamond">
<li>But neither the Chinese nor the Muslims went on to develop 
   analytic geometry, which can reference every geometical object 
   and every geometric operation.  This was first done by Pierre 
   Fermat and Rene Descartes in the 17th century, when Western 
   scientists began applying mathematics to every aspect of the 
   physical world.</font></P>
</blockquote>

<P><FONT FACE="Garamond">
3.16 As for instrumentation and mathematics, consider a few 
examples:</font></P>

<blockquote>
<P><FONT FACE="Garamond"> 
<li>Huygens patented the first pendulum clock in 1656.  This gave 
   the first reasonably accuracte time measurements.  The 
   pendulum clock was based on Huygens theory of evolutes, 
   specifically the cycloid.  The mathematical theory and the 
   mechanical applications developed in parallel.  Other curves 
   also had a "mechanical" equivalent, such as the tractrix -- the 
   curve traced by one end of a rod when the other end is dragged 
   along a line perpendicular to the initial position of the rod.
   Mathematics also solved the problems of developing optics.

<li>A good example of the 17th century quantification of natural 
   phenomena is the development of thermometers and the 
   mathematical understanding of the expansion of air as its heat 
   increases.</font></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Garamond">
<li>No other culture independently developed scientific 
   instrumentation to match what was developed in Europe from the 
   17th century onwards, or made mathematical calculations with  
   detailed quantification of of temperatures, pressures, chemical 
   reactions, produced by scientific hypothesis, observation and 
   experiment.</font></P>
</blockquote>

<P><FONT FACE="Garamond">
3.17 My quantification and instrumentaion argument for the Western 
scientific revolution requires a few important qualifications:</font></P>

<blockquote>
<P><FONT FACE="Garamond">
<li>The 17th century scientific revolution consisted of work by 
   people attempting a variety of goals.  Some were pure alchemy 
   and magic, rather than the observation of and experimention on 
   the real world that we recognize as "science." Some of the 
   best scientific results were byproducts of projects that did 
   not have "scientific" goals.</font></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Garamond">
<li>Part of the 17th century scientific revolution was 
   experimental science, part was abstract scientific method, part 
   was the systematic application of instrumentation techniques 
   (optics, measuring devices).  Sometimes they came together in 
   the quantification and sometimes they developed independently.</font></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Garamond">
<li>Sociological, religious, economic and other non-technical 
   reasons were as important as the sequence of technical 
   developments, which I characterized as the "mathematization of 
   science," in causing the 17th century scientific revolution. 
   None of the explanations can be extracted from the complex of 
   causes.</font></P>

<h3><a name="S5.06">Dealing with crossposted trolls  </a> </h3>

<P><FONT FACE="Garamond">
5.06 If you see an obvious crossposted troll to soc.history.what-if
   you might help remove the thread from soc.history.what-if by 
   using the following strategy:</font></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Garamond">
 <li>If you must respond to the original posting, please do so in
  soc.history.what-if <b>alone</b>. Trim your headers and 
  <b>do not crosspost.</font></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Garamond">
 <li>If you want to respond in the other newsgroups I suggest that
  you respond in <b>separate</b> posts. The original message will 
  then be trimmed so that it will henceforward be addressed to 
  only a single newsgroup.</font></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Garamond">
 <li>In that way, somebody reading a flame invitation in the other
  newsgroup will respond only in that newsgroup and leave 
  soc.history.what-if out of it. The content of your comment in 
  the other newsgroups is at your discretion, but I would note 
  that the more it rejects the trollster's idea, the more likely 
  it will attract the rest of the discussion on the thread, which 
  may then proceed in blissful ignorance of the fact that 
  soc.history.what-if has disappeared from the newsgroup line.</font></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Garamond">
 <li>This advice works for most trollsters, who are not focused
   on details.  Regrettably there are a few ultra-trolsters who
   re-add trimmed newsgroups to the crosspost line.</font></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Garamond">
<li>Alt.revisionism, rather than soc.history.what-if, is the place 
   for debates on the truth of the commonly accepted historical 
   record. Our Charter enables us to discuss alternative histories 
   in which events differ from the known historical record, rather 
   than denials of the truth of the commonly accepted historical 
   record, such as the type known as &quot;Holocaust denial.&quot;

<li>Alternate history operates on the assumption that the commonly 
   accepted historical record is substantially accurate.</font></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Garamond">
<li>Secret history is dedicated to revising the commonly accepted 
   historical record. It is incompatible with alternate history. 
   In partiular we have seen many posts by a few persons who 
   deny that the Holocaust happened, or that a faulty historical 
   record over reports it.  In this insance, secret history
   accepts an alternate history as the truth rather than the 
   commonly accepted historical record. This discussion is 
   suitable for alt.revisionism but <b>not</b> for soc.history.what-if.</font></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Garamond">
<li>However, the soc.history.what-if Charter does allow discussion 
   of &quot;what if the Holocaust had never happened.&quot; Anyone posing 
   this WI should beware of the infestation of Holocaust deniers 
   that it will pull out of the woodwork.  Similarly discussion 
   of WI's in which a post WW II Nazi Germania managed to 
   suppress knowledge of the Holocaust (as in the AH postulated 
   in the novel <b><i>Fatherland</b></i>, will probably encourage the fans of 
   secret history to reinvade soc.history.what-if.</font></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Garamond">
<li>To sum up, a valid AH for soc.history.what-if cannot claim 
   that events which demonstrably happened in real history, 
   such as the Holocaust, <b><i>didn't</b></i> happen in real history. But a 
   valid AH for soc.history.what-if may ask how the world would 
   have been had the Holocaust, or other event denied by 
   believers in secret history, had not happened.</font></P>

   alternate history. For example Harry Turtledove's published AH 
   stories, the <b><i>Agent of Byzantium</b></i> series, is based on the 
   interesting POD of Muhammed becoming a Christian and develops 
   an AH that envisions a flourishing Byzantine Empire. But other 
   published AH's are extremely improbabile, which means that most

<li>The Charter also allows discussion of how well the possibilites

   aspects of the author's writing technique such as &quot;enjoyably 
   nasty stuff,&quot; or &quot;easy to pull a <i>deus ex machina</i>

<P><FONT FACE="Garamond">
CHARTER</font></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Garamond">
The soc.history.what-if newsgroup will be open to discussion 
of alternate history.  This is "what-ifs" regarding specific 
historical events.</font></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Garamond">

Specifically, but not exclusively:</font></P>
<blockquote>
<P><FONT FACE="Garamond">
<li>Historical events - what could have happened if they had 
   been different?<br>
<li>How could this have happened differently (i.e. discussion 
   of how the divergence could have occurred, not of what its 
   consequences would be.)</font></P>
</blockquote>

<P><FONT FACE="Garamond">
Note: the following topics are not to be discussed:</font></P>

<blockquote>
<P><FONT FACE="Garamond">
<li>Revisionism regarding the Holocaust or Turkish/Armenian 
   massacres (post to alt.revisionism). &quot;What if the Holocaust 
   had not happened?&quot; is a legitimate question<br>
<li>Future history - "What if the President were assassinated 
   tomorrow?"<br>
<li>Alternate history in fictional worlds - &quot;What if Luke had

There is no charter for alt.history.what-if, the newsgroup that

<P><FONT FACE="Garamond">
RATIONALE</font></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Garamond">
alt.history.what-if is a thriving newsgroup. It has a reasonable 
posting level, a well-maintained FAQ (thank you, Robert Schmunk), 
and a good signal-to-noise level (no ad hominems, only a few 
flames before a recent flamewar that seems to have stayed in one 
thread, and is dying).</font></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Garamond">
But it's on alt.*. Lots of people can't get alt.*. (Lots of 
.ac.uk sites for a start). So I propose we move it to soc.*</font></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Garamond">
There are several other soc.history.* groups, and it will fit 
well into that hierarchy.</font></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Garamond">
If this CFV passes, a proposal will be made for 
alt.history.what-if to be rmgrouped. I appreciate that alt.* 
groups never truly die, but I hope that it will disappear 
from most sites.</font></P>
