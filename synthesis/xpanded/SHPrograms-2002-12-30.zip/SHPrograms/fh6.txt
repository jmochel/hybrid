                       The History of Known Space, to 2221


     Presented here is my version of the future history of humanity, from the
     near-present to the year 2221 A.D.  The events I have imagined here are
    largely what I see as being somewhere between possible and inevitable, and
    in no case are they necessarily desirable either by me or by anyone else.
    This is all idle speculation, and if you disagree with me, good!  That is
      to say, no insult is intended or should be inferred from any of what I
                                  have written.

      *Huge earthquake (8.6 on the richter scale) hits Tokyo, but the city is
       well prepared and damage is minimal

      *Basque resistance heats up, especially after Spain gains the
       presidency of the EU
       Kurdistan is carved out of Iraq with US guidance; Kurdistan
      *
       immediately begins trying to liberate Kurds in Turkey
       Peace is finally reached in Northern Ireland, which becomes a
      *sovereign state under the agreement signed

      *Missions to Mars reveal no existence of Martian life and fail to
       capture the public imagination

      *Quebec secedes from Canada; the maritimes become the Eastern Canadian
       Republic

      *Italy dissolves; Ten independent states are formed and begin
       skirmishing over territory; Slovenia takes Trieste; Internal pressure
       on NATO builds ( historical map is available)

      *After Labor wins a decisive victory, Israeli-Palestinian peace is
       finally reached; Palestine has near complete sovereignty within its
       borders

      *Generals of North Korea stage a coup, ousting Kim Jong-il (2011); they
       try various scapegoats (Kim's killer is never officially found) and
       set about discussing reunification with the South

      *Jiang Zemin loses power and is placed under house arrest, under which
       he dies in 2022; Yang Zhonghan eventually gains power and begins the
       Revitalization Campaign (aimed at gradually introducing democratic
       reforms)

      *Several armed conflicts occur in the South China Sea; China and a
       joint Philippine/Taiwanese force come close to war (2012); Finally, in
       the Bangkok Accord (2013), a precise scheme of division is laid out in
       which China, Malaysia and the Philippines gain the top hand; The
       division of international waters is protested in the UN but China
       vetoes a censure measure, and no country is willing to risk angering
       China (then engaged in its own internal struggles, and with unclear
       military control) with anything more than symbolic protests

      *The International Space Station is finished, well behind schedule and
       over budget (2011)
       Microsoft is dissolved in a US court decision
      *
       Poland moves into Belorussia, on the basis of historical claims and to
      *put down a strong, militia style anti Polish Belorussian government;
       Poland is successful until Ukraine moves into Belorussia to "protect"
       it; Poland withdraws; eastern Belorussia becomes a Ukrainian
       protectorate (2014)

      *The "Big One" hits southern California (2016), causing huge losses of
       life and property (11,000 dead, $517.4 billion damage); Large parts of
       the state (including all of LA) remain under martial law for three
       years; Drastic federal spending cuts are required to pay for
       rebuilding, ending many programs (including the "Social Security
       Bailout Act" of 2011, but not including very many military programs)
       and sending the world into recession (2018-21)

      *The last publicly funded SETI program (at Cambridge) ceases due to
       lack of funds; Private programs continue

      *India institutes a very strict two-child-per-family population control
       program

       Agency, with extensive corporate backing;  The base is given the
       rather boring name of Luna One (2020)

      *Social Security in the US goes bankrupt; Massive rioting follows; St.
       Louis is nearly destroyed in the so-called "Long Week" (2022); Racial
       violence spreads nationwide; "Wheelchair Rebellion" occurs when the
       AARP calls its members to the Mall in Washington, D.C.; 500,000 show
       up and the protests briefly turn violent; Vid audiences are horrified
       to see police beating elderly people on the steps of the Capitol

      *Korea is reunified and quickly becomes occupied with rebuilding and
       absorbing the North; Korea begins a space program (based in part on
       Kim Jong-il's ballistic missile program) to focus and restore common
       national pride
       Huge British-French-German dispute over tariffs and Euro policy causes
      *
       the collapse of NATO and nearly dissolves the EU; French and German
       armed forces briefly stare at each across their common border for
       three tense weeks (2028)
       Julia Karlan and Antony DaRosa invent a method to modify the spins of
      *subatomic particles; In combination with the recent discovery of
       momons, near-relativistic (though not yet FTL, nor efficient) travel
       becomes a real possibility

      *Japanese diet votes to annul the constitutional ban on a standing
       army; SDF is sent to the Kurils; Russia quickly cedes the islands to
       Japan (2028)

      *Brazil quits Mercosur under internal nationalist pressure (2029);
       Mercosur gradually falls apart following this

      *Somalian clans agree to a proportional representation system, and
       peace, albeit shaky, is finally brought to the Horn of Africa

      *EU, Japan, South Africa, Indonesia, Brazil and most other large
       nations introduce population control laws, in most cases limiting
       families to two children; The US stubbornly refuses to do so in spite
       of mounting evidence of a coming population crash

      *The previously-breakneck pace of computer technology development slows
       greatly as designers come up against the molecular barrier;
       Originally-optimistic forecasts calling for full artificial
       intelligence before 2040 are revised to 2100 or even later;  Computers
       produced in the 2020's do not become fully obsolete for decades;  Many
       computer companies fail

      *Border skirmishes between Brazil and Argentina are followed by full
       war (2031-34); Brazil gains no Argentinean ground, but Uruguay becomes
       a Brazilian protectorate

      *Indonesia invades Malaysia, with Singapore remaining neutral; ASEAN
       dissolves (2039); war continues

      *Japanese scientists develop the so-called "White Bacteria" to combat

       environmental protests against it (2034)
       The former Italian states' borders are frozen in the Vatican Accords
      *
       (2030)
       Egyptian and Libyan tensions flare into war (2032-34); Egypt finally
      *takes control of Libya and northern Sudan (which had been home to many
       Libyan guerilla bases) from the hands of Qaddafi's successor (his son)

      *The Aryan American Party (AAP) makes strong showings in the US during
       the 2032 and 2036 elections

      *Southern and northern California agree to greater equality in the
       Sacramento Contract

      *A Basque group uses a nuclear bomb on Madrid, killing 12,400; This is
       the first offensive use of nuclear weapons since W.W.II; Spain
       thereupon crushes the Basque movement fiercely; Deaths, cancers and
       other aftereffects of the blast continue until the present day

      *Poland moves into Lithuania following a long period of anti-Polish
       nationalist fervor in Lithuania; Germany and Ukraine subsequently
       invade Poland when it refuses to withdraw its troops (2035); German
       and Ukrainian forces bisect Poland, meeting at Lodz (2037); Poland
       sues for peace; Lithuania becomes a Ukrainian colony and both Ukraine
       and Germany retain large land gains

      *The term "Modified English" is coined by Philippine writer Alexandra
       Feliciano to refer to the common world tongue

      *The UN grants sovereignty to Northern Cyprus

      *The Scottish parliament votes to secede from the UK, which hesitantly
       allows the move, but retains the name United Kingdom (referring only
       to England and Wales)

      *Various countries repeal their monopoly laws to encourage their own
       international competitiveness; The first country to do so is the US

      *Japan, the Philippines and several US mining concerns argue and then
       skirmish over their competing claims to several plots of prime
       ocean-bottom land in the Pacific (2034-37); A Japanese-Philippine
       alliance eventually forces the US groups out; The world's first true
       corporate state, the Pacific Mining Union (PMU) is formed as a puppet
       of the Japanese and Philippine backers

      *Vietnam holds democratic, multiparty elections; The National
       Democratic Party wins (2031) and soon moves into Laos to "liberate" it
       from its corrupt dictatorship; Laos becomes and Vietnamese
       protectorate and is eventually absorbed
       The Albanian government collapses (2032); Greek forces "strategically
      *
       occupy" Albania to stop guerilla fighting and ethnic cleansing of
       Hellenic Albanians; A provisional (and strongly pro-Greek) government
       is set up in Albania

    IMAGE 2040's


      *Many corporations begin "moving up" into space;  Several nations
       follow suit, but with much less enthusiasm;  By the end of the 2040's,
       approximately 1000 people live permanently off-Earth, mostly
       scientists and engineers

      *Indian civil war (2043-48) and balkanization; Over 1.7 million people
       are killed in the fighting; Nine states result: Kashmir, Pradesh,
       Bengal, Assam, Kalinga, Dravidia, Goa, Maharashtra and Gujarat (for
       map, click here); Myanmar takes the Andaman islands (2047)

      *A Vietnamese-Philippine coalition imposes peace on the Malaysian
       battlefield, ending the Indo-Malaysian war (2042)

      *Baluchi resistance heats back up; Iran moves forces into the region
       and begins attacking Baluchi bases in Pakistan; Pakistan moves in to
       protect its territory, causing full-scale war (2047)

      *AAP wins gubernatorial elections in the Carolinas, Florida, Georgia,
       Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas (2040; Green party also wins
       elections in two states (Michigan and Connecticut) but the AAP
       victories grab the spotlight; Various horrible laws are enacted in the
       AAP states (racial tagging, forced abortions, labor camps for the
       homeless, etc.)

      *Korea establishes humanity's first Martian base (2045), soon followed
       by France, Germany, Japan and others

       Xingu Fever kills 150,000 in South America (2046-49)
      *
       Riots occur worldwide as AIDS continues to spread despite the
      *availability of the vaccine, and because of its still-high price

      *After a huge dispute with Spain and Portugal, the UK becomes the
       supreme power in the northern Atlantic, specifically in sea-floor
       mining (2049); Britain turns more and more to the sea for its
       sustenance

      *Fusion reactors are marketed commercially; Many small nations go into
       debt to purchase them

      *Pope Julius V declares homosexuality and the marriage of priests not
       to be sins (2041); the Catholic church splits into True Orthodox and
       Catholic sects, among others; Many catholics become protestants

      *Katanga secedes from the Democratic Republic of Congo with extensive
       South African assistance (2043); Katanga quickly shows itself
       determined not to be dominated by South Africa, though

      *Under a Communist government, France abuses the Euro to the point of
       censure by the EU Bank and President (who happens to be German);
       France withdraws from the EU (2041), followed by most other EU nations
       (who are eager to avoid a German-controlled Union), save Greece,
       Poland and Belgium; The EU gradually crumbles; In the wake of this,
       the Walloon-Flemish conflict heats up in Belgium;  The ESA is
       privatized and soon parceled up and purchased by various European,
       American, Korean and Japanese corporations;  Luna One becomes a Korean
       possession (2044), and the name is simply changed to a Korean
       translation of the original

      *Albania is formally integrated into Greece (2045)

      *Space station Enterprise is constructed to serve as a corporate
       habitat/headquarters for several groups; The Council of Sovereign
       Nations is created to govern the station; The CSN charter includes a
       statement about "full reproductive freedom for all citizens,"
       promising unlimited births for productive personnel; Several nations
       protest but are unable to extend their authority to the CSN's high
       home ground

      *Colonies are established throughout the solar system by Korea,
       Germany, Japan, France, Ukraine, China and others;  All space-going
       nations begin developing space navies;  Interplanetary safety is
       barely enforced through extensive international agreements and
       space-going nations' navies serving as UN Peacekeepers when
       necessary;  By the end of the decade, more than 10,000 people live
       permanently off-Earth
       The crew of the UN patrol ship Venizia mutinies in Lunar orbit,
      *
       becoming the first band of interplanetary pirates (2050);  The ship
       takes a small L5 agro station as its HQ, but only holds out for three
       weeks before a UN Peacekeeper force storms the station
       Baluchistan declares itself to be independent with Pakistani backing,
      *but war continues

      *The US supreme court strikes down the Texas Criminal Control Act of
       2055, which, among other things, outlaws 'mixed marriages';  Texas'
       governor declares the state's secession from the USA, nationalizes the
       Texas National Guard and all US federal troops in the state and gets
       the other AAP governors to join him; The Second American Civil War
       begins (2057); The AAP states adopt the name Aryan American States

      *South American rainforest natives in Brazil and Venezuela begin
       guerilla warfare against the two nations, citing economic and
       political injustices; The Native Tribes Coalition is formed (2059)

      *PMU productivity goes down almost 30% over five years (2051-56);
       Japanese and Philippine troops in the PMU are reduced to a bare
       minimum (i.e., police) level; The PMU asserts its independence from
       Japan and the Philippines (2058) and sets up secondary headquarters on
       the Enterprise, becoming the first sovereign nation to do so

      *Germany uses nanotech to construct a tunnel to Sweden; Though
       completed ahead of schedule (2051), the project is still a failure due
       to simple lack of appeal and competition from hover and zepp transport

      *The entire world goes off beef for several years when the Anti-Meat
       Alliance (AMA) releases a tailored virus which is highly communicable
       and, while being non-fatal to cattle, is 99% fatal in humans; Hundreds
       of thousands of cattle are subsequently slaughtered

    IMAGE 2060's


      *The CSN is reformed into the League of Sovereign Nations (LSN) in
       2060; Charter includes provisions for mutual defense and rejection of
       the UN; Signatories include Boeing, General Motors, Hyundai,
       Mitsubishi, the PMU, Procter and Gamble, Siemens and Sumitomo; Chair
       Yoshiko Tezuka makes her famous speech about the stupidity of warring
       over "a handful of dirt and a flag";  Myanmar, Turkey, Bulgaria,
       Tunisia and Equador quit the UN and join the LSN (2062-69);  The LSN
       is criticized for accepting only human rights abusers into its camp,
       and also for practicing money diplomacy, but rapid improvement in the
       new LSN members' quality of life silences the critics;  Many smaller
       corps join the LSN

      *A series of nanoviruses (nanotech which destroy other nanotech) is
       released somewhere in Germany by a disgruntled ex-designer of the
       German-Swedish Tunnel;  Although not the first, they are the most
       dangerous ones yet devised;  Medical nanotech-use plummets when
       nanomeds start malfunctioning due to nanovirus infection;  Many people
       subsequently attempt to create nanovirus-proof nanotech, but none ever
       really succeed and nanotech use dwindles

      *Taiwan pulls out of the Mainland-Taiwan unification agreement, but the
       agreement is revivified when the projected date of final unification
       is pushed back by 50 years
       Holographic projection in real-time is perfected
      *
       The Indian states plunge back into war (2064-68), with little land
      *changing hands;  The main change is that Sri Lanka forms a union with
       Dravidia, and does so peacefully save for a separatist terrorist
       campaign;  A two-year Indian truce is signed in Johannesburg; The
       truce lasts, largely due to exhaustion on all sides

      *The AAS move to take Virginia, Washington DC, Arizona and New Mexico,
       then succeed in doing so (2063);  USA retakes Washington DC, but an
       AAS nuclear strike launched from a former US base in Oklahoma destroys
       the city;  The Capitol of the USA is moved to Boston;  The USA briefly
       considers a retaliatory nuclear strike, but foreign pressure and aid
       stop this

      *Genesis Corporation is formed (2062)

      *Iran pulls out of Baluchistan and recognizes its independence

      *The Catholic Church is reunited after the death of Julius V;  John XXV
       is anointed Supreme Pontiff;  The Church slowly undoes Julius' reforms
       and regains lost membership, but never again returns to its former
       status

      *Belgium peacefully dissolves into Flanders and Wallonia;  Flanders
       initiates unification with the Netherlands

      *The Lapp nationalist movement grows in Sweden, Norway and (to a lesser
       extent) Finland

    IMAGE 2070's


      *The KD drive surpasses the light-speed barrier, allowing interstellar
       travel, though not economically yet (2072);  LSN nations, which are
       the first to have the FTL technology, begin interstellar exploration
       (uncrewed at first) and begin extensive exploitation of the Solar
       System;  Barnard's Star is found to have a marginally-inhabitable
       planet with extensive resources (Nova Siberia);  Interest in SETI
       briefly resparks but then fizzles no ET's are found by probes, nor
       evidence of ET life of any kind;  Barnard's Star is colonized;  LSN
       naming procedures are established and less-attractive planets around
       Centauri, Escalante (Lalande 21185) and Wolf (Wolf 359) are explored,
       though not yet colonized;  More than 250,000 people live permanently
       off-Earth by the end of the decade, and more than 1000 live in
       extrasolar settlements

      *Archer Daniel Midlands, Citibank, Daiwa, Ethiopia, New Zealand, the
       Philippines, Phillips, Sony, Tasmania and Time-Warner join the LSN;
       The LSN begins an ad campaign depicting "the competition" (the UN) as
       weak and indecisive, with the tag line, "LSN - We get things done."
       New Zealand South Island Party (NZSIP) forces a vote on South Island
      *
       secession in the New Zealand parliament, amidst cries that the SIFTZ
       is a failure;  Secession vote fails
       The AAS takes SoCal (2071) then moves to take NoCal;  Battle of
      *Springfield (Missouri, in 2073) stops further AAS encroachment;
       Fresno is destroyed by AAS nukes;  The US then destroys Austin, TX in
       retaliation;  The Los Angeles Massacre occurs when the AAS rounds up
       60,000 "militant rioters and looters" (notably almost all
       dark-skinned) and kills them;  The USA requests help from the
       international community;  Canada, Germany, France, Quebec, Japan,
       Korea and South Africa all respond with military and financial aid;
       The Sabre of Allah (the 231st Special Forces, an all-Moslem and mostly
       African-American guerilla warfare unit) is founded in the USA to fight
       within the AAS;  The Sabre's members are trained in Capoeira and other
       skills, and remain a popular subject for media in the USA and AAS
       alike up to the present (although media depictions of the group vary
       widely, of course)

      *Kazakhstan begins unifying the Central Asian nations by force (2070)

      *Maharashtra absorbs Goa by force (2073);  Bengal conquers Pradesh
       (2072) and then Kalinga (2076) and begins calling itself "India";
       Pakistan takes Kashmir almost peacefully, as Bengal is too busy to

      *Venezuela makes peace with the NTC and begins large infrastructure
       improvements in the NTC's Venezuelan homelands

      *Georgia unites the Caucasus with the help of a Sumitomo army, but
       Armenian resistance proves too strong and Armenia frees itself
       (2075-6)

    IMAGE 2080's


      *Several small skirmishes occur between the LSN nations over the
       colonization of space, but the losers do not join the UN (as they are
       corporations and would be be unable to do so in the first place);
       Colonization in general continues to grow and accelerate

      *Under pressure from colonization efforts, a joint
       Japanese-Korean-corporate team completes the first orbital cable at
       Pontiniak, Indonesia (2086);  The cable, officially called the
       Skyline, boosts the local economy hugely;  The local area is
       officially governed by a Korean-Japanese-Malaysian council, but is
       effectively independent;  The Skyline zone is soon competing fiercely
       with Singapore for trade

      *The War of Italian Reunification begins when Padania occupies San
       Marino (2084);  Abruzzi, Tuscany and Venizia seize the excuse to
       invade Padania, then pull in all the Italian states, save Sicily
       (which remains independent) and Piedmont (which is annexed by France
       in 2085);  The War is complete in 2086

      *After Brazil massacres a village of 2600 native people, the NTC asks
       for Venezuelan and Colombian assistance;  The Rainforest War (aka the
       Amazonas War) ensues (2081-94);  Peru takes a chunk of Brazilian
       territory, as does Argentina;  Argentina returns Uruguay to
       independence, though only as a satellite state;  Venezuela takes
       Suriname and the Guianas;  The LSN remains neutral, the UN remains
       petrified
       Australia joins the LSN (2085) soon after establishing the Northern
      *
       Homeland, a semi-independent aboriginal protectorate in the northeast,
       occupying most of the former Queensland and some of the Northern
       Territory;  Australia is considered by many to be the first real
       nation-state to join the LSN;  Australia begins its own interstellar
       colonization effort
       Decades of mutual espionage between Hyundai and General Motors results
      *in the Corp War (2087-89);  Several orbital habitats are destroyed,
       though the groundside conflict remains just short of outright war;
       The war ends with a stalemate;  The UN's orbital command takes little
       notice of the war, much to the consternation of the people of Earth

      *Kazakhstan largely succeeds in unifying central Asia, with only
       Tajikstan remaining independent (2085)

      *The NZSIP again forces a vote on South Island secession but fails
       (2087)

      *The Iranian government falls in an 11-day revolution, led by the
       leader of the Persian Women's Party;  A democratic government is set
       up by a mixed military-democratic coalition and the country's name
       officially reverts to Persia (2082);  The ex-Iranian
       government-in-exile flees to Georgia;  Persia's government soon begins
       exporting revolution to Iraq, which is still under a military
       dictatorship

      *A brief attempt by Maharashtra to take Gujarat is stopped by Bengali
       ("Indian") and Dravidian forces' counter-invasion of Maharashtra
       (2083);  Gujarat is awarded with a small portion of Maharashtran
       territory as compensation;  Again the UN is powerless to change the
       outcome

      *Myanmar invades northern Thailand (2081);  Mitsubishi troops win the
       war for Myanmar, although the entry of Hyundai troops on the side of
       Thailand brings the war to a halt (2083);  The UN passes various
       resolutions but is basically ineffective in changing the conflict one
       way or another

      *CitiBank (including Chase) and Daiwa Bank merge to form Alphabank
       (2084), at the time the largest corp in human space

      *The increasing reliance of humanity upon a breakneck pace of
       technological progress is criticized, but little in the way of
       alternatives seem available

      *Lebanon and Syria unite as the Druze Republic after several years of
       debates and negotiations (2087)

       The Tibetan independence movement turns violent after the 16th Dalai
      *
       Lama calls for military action against the PRC government ("inverting
       the occupation" are his actual words);  Chongqing is struck by a
       conventional bomb, killing 422 (2090);  Many other guerilla attacks
       occur, though none cause as much loss of life or media furor
       Taiwan repudiates the Mainland unification agreement and declares its
      *independence from China (2090);  Taiwan joins the LSN;  An LSN commsat
       is destroyed a PRC-crewed weapons platform, citing a "dangerously
       collision-prone orbit," and disrupting communications between Taiwan
       and the Philippines for about 100 hours; The Straits War follows
       (2091-93);  Taiwan is largely crippled by conventional strikes, but
       China's victory is pyrrhic at best as it is soon forced to accept the
       independence of both Taiwan and Tibet when LSN forces intervene
       (2093); The LSN forces the PRC to withdraw from both Taiwan and
       Tibet;  PRC colonies on Mars and in Saturn orbit declare their
       independence as well, and are recognized as such by China, then join
       the LSN;  This is considered by many to be the first LSN-UN war, and
       is also notably the first conflict in which full exoskeletal armor is
       standard equipment for front-line troops;  The image of LSN troops in
       exoskeletal armor planting the Tibetan flag atop the Potala Palace is
       impressed upon the common memory

      *The US moves to take SoCal and Memphis (2094) with the war cry "Never
       forget LA!";  A Mexican diversion attack on Texas allows US victory,
       though it also results in anti-US feelings among the Mexican populace,
       who feel that the US never fully acknowledges Mexico's contribution to
       California's liberation, nor to Mexico's loss of 45,000 lives in the
       effort

      *After Venezuela and Colombia reach victory over Brazil in the Amazonas
       War (2094), the so-called "South American Cold War" sets in between
       Venezuela and Colombia

      *Korea and Japan quit the UN and join the LSN;  Many smaller
       corporations, nations and stations follow

      *Barnard's, Centauri, Escalante and Wolf continue to be settled;  The
       focus of interstellar colonization moves towards Sirius, Luyten (UV
       Ceti), Fuxing (Ross 248) and Jayapura (Ross 154);  As interstellar
       colonization becomes a matter of national pride as well as a
       population pressure 'release valve', Bengal ("India"), South Africa,
       Egypt and several other quickly-growing countries begin their own
       drives;  Bengal fortifies Nicobar as its main spaceport;  Several
       economics pundits suggest that interplanetary trade will pay for
       itself within 10 years;  Several nations begin intensive homesteading
       campaigns, both to spread their influence and to reduce population
       pressures;  "Extraterran relocation" becomes a common practice, and is
       increasingly seen as being a humane alternative to allowing the poor
       to die through starvation;  Many corporations gain vast numbers of
       employees as they do "contract resettlement," accepting poorer
       nations' citizens as their colonists;  The UN, largely unable to
       maintain its interplanetary and interstellar policing activities,
       cedes control of Earth Orbital Command to the LSN;  The K-D "speed
       limit" passes 0.01 light-years per day

      *A second orbital cable is built at Libreville, Gabon;  plans are made
       for more on Earth, as well as at Nova Siberia, Mars and several other
       places

      *Large labor protests occur in several African nations when off-Earth
       gem-grade diamonds flood the market and drive prices down

      *Italy retakes Milan, driving French forces to the Ticina river before
       stopping (2090);  France stoically accepts the loss

      *Katanga takes the northeast panhandle of the DRC

      *Hokkaido briefly secedes from Japan (2091-93) but is lured back with
       promises of investment;  Japanese colonies in the outer solar system
       demand similar treatment but are basically brushed off

      *Iraq goes to war with Persia over Persian terrorist bases located
       within Iraq;  Persia, with French and Indonesian help, soon wins the
       war and sets up a provisional government in Baghdad (2098);  Elections
       are scheduled for 2100
       Indonesia assists a resurgent Muslim revolution in Mindanao;  The
      *
       Philippines soon requests assistance from its primary allies, Japan
       and Taiwan, resulting in the Mindanao War (2097-2103)
       Many of the huge corporations (including General Motors, Hyundai and
      *Danone, among others) fail, due to a strange combination of
       overextension, overspecialization and general loss of momentum;  The
       Crash of '95 (2095), when five major corps implode in a single month,
       causes a brief global recession (2095-96), as well as causing corps
       systemwide and beyond to reconsider their basic strategies;
       Singapore, which has tied itself quite closely to several of the
       collapsed corps, goes bankrupt and 'merges' with the Skyline
       government (2097), holding semi-independent status;  Several stations
       in the asteroid belt and Jovian orbit take the opportunity to buy
       their freedom and declare their sovereignty

      *Sweden grants independence to Lappland (official name: Sapmi)

      *Many pundits report that, while birth rates are declining worldwide,
       they are not declining fast enough;  At some point in the 2090's, the
       population of Earth passes 10 billion;  Excessive reliance on
       monogenetic crops and ever-more-strained agriculture is widely
       criticized, but little is done to stop the problem

    IMAGE 2100's


      *China attempts to take control of Mongolia, first politically (by
       aiding pro-China parties) and then militarily;  Mongolia's application
       to the LSN is accepted, and LSN troops quickly rebuff the first
       Chinese assault;  A large part of Inner Mongolia is ceded to Mongolia,
       and Yunnan is granted independence as the Dali Republic, which
       naturally joins the LSN (2101)

      *'Leadership Lag' is experienced more and more by extrasolar colonies,
       in spite of ever-increasing communications speeds (K-D drives are able
       to exceed 0.02 LYD before the decade is out);  Corruption in local
       leadership is also widely noted, crowding increases while colonization
       efforts continue apace, and popular unrest grows;  LSN command is
       either unaware, unresponsive or unable to do anything, though

      *Discovery of a Terran/garden-type world at Epsilon Eridani results in
       an intense rush for colonization there;  The system is dubbed
       Petit-Sol, and the planet (actually a moon) is dubbed Petit-Terre;
       Many nations institute tax-exemptions and other incentives for
       homesteaders;  Salvador (Ross 128), Francisco (Procyon), Auxerre
       Nouveau (61 Cygni) and Malacca (Epsilon Indi) are also explored and
       colonized

      *The PRC and USA force the dissolution of the UN (2103);  The USA joins
       LSN, while China forms the Asian Council, but only Georgia and
       Afghanistan join it;  Various other small coalitions form, but most
       ex-UN nations join the LSN (2103-06);  Several marginally-stable
       countries are notably required to undergo extensive evaluation periods
       before being allowed entrance to the LSN

      *Skirmishes continue between the USA and AAS;  Large parts of Kansas,
       Oklahoma, Missouri and Arkansas become wastelands;  AAS pushes into
       southern Utah;  Following respectful but resolute requests by a
       coalition of Native Americans to the government of the USA, the
       near-sovereign Native American Republic is carved out of parts of
       Wyoming, Colorado, North Dakota and Minnesota (2107);  The NAR joins
       the LSN;  A plebiscite in Utah shows (false) public support for the
       AAS government;  The USA withdraws from Antarctica, resulting in
       diplomatic squabbles among the contenders but no outright warfare

      *Ukraine (new to the LSN) takes Romania and Moldova, citing various
       ridiculous reasons (racial similarity and economic co-prosperity being
       the main ones);  Slovakia, Hungary and Yugoslavia form the Central
       European Strategic Alliance (CESA) as a united front against Ukrainian
       aggression;  Russia protests the Ukrainian action to the LSN, but
       neither Russia nor the LSN as a whole take any real action
       The Genesis corporation takes over the administration and government
      *
       of Mali in a popular election
       Following huge riots in Xinjiang against the PRC government,
      *Kazakhstan invades western China, stopping just short of Gansu and
       Qinghai;  The Eastern Turkestan Republic (AKA the Uighur Republic) is
       established as a Kazakhstani puppet/satellite (2109)

      *Eastern Siberia attempts to secede from Russia, but Russian troops
       enforce its unity (2108);  Separatists soon find aid from Korea, China
       and Japan

      *Elections in Iraq give victory to pro-reform parties (2100);  Peaceful
       relations between Iraq and Persia grow

      *Japanese colonies around Saturn rebel, establishing the Saturnian
       Democratic Republic (SDR) in 2106;  Japanese forces fight briefly to
       rein them in but meet with defeat when several pirate groups join the
       fray on the SDR's side;  Rumors arise that the SDR is really just a
       front for criminal organizations, especially the Yakuza

      *Following advances in exoskeletal armor, several countries adopt
       biotipped slugthrower (BTST) weapons, soon dubbed "batshit" by US
       troops;  Main users of BTST include China and Georgia;  LSN member
       nations agree to forbid such weapons themselves, and grant themselves
       the right and responsibility to intervene against and depose any
       government, LSN or otherwise, which uses BTST weapons ("Anyone so
       psychotic as to use BTST weapons on this earth belongs not in office
       but in protective custody," remarks the chair of the LSN BTST policy
       committee)

      *Mindanao War ends with Mindanao an independent state, but also a
       satellite of Indonesia (2104), after the Philippines is convinced by
       Japan to let the island go

      *Following decades of low-scale guerilla warfare, the government of
       Madagascar votes to divide into the independent states of Hova (north)
       and Merina (south)

      *Druze Republic divides into Syria (north), Badiyat (south) and Lebanon
       (west)

      *Geologists estimate that Earth's total remaining reserves of petroleum
       and natural gas will last only about 25 years at most

          2110's

       First discovery of extraterrestrial sapients, with contact of a Qiqiu
      *
       scout ship near Mendoza (Wolf 424) in 2112;  Bungled contact brings
       armed conflict;  Local ships are quickly defeated by the Qiqiu
       forces;  An LSN fleet turns the tide and peace is finally restored
       (2113), followed by hesitantly positive human-Qiqiu relations
       The LSN shifts to the method of colonial rule to the "governor-fleet"
      *system, wherein a colonial governor, sometimes appointed by Earth,
       sometimes elected locally, is backed up by a powerful naval fleet and
       ground force in each system;  Individual nations begin to lose power
       over their colonies, unless they can afford their own fleets, which
       few can;  The new system is seen as a stop-gap measure to prevent
       colonial fractionalization, but no future alternative is mentioned;
       'Colonial nationalism', also known as 'systemism', grows as the first
       generation of humans who've never been within a light-year of Earth
       grow up;  Occasional attempts by 'systemist' rebels are quashed by LSN
       command and its governors;  One of the first widely-known attempts at
       rebellion occurs when Pandora's Box, a 'rec station' (providing a
       number of services, but mostly sexual ones) at Petit-Sol refuses to
       accept LSN governance and declares itself independent;  The brief
       Prostitutes' War (also disparagingly called the "Whores' War") ends
       with a bloody massacre of the station's inhabitants by LSN computroops

      *A final push by the USA retakes Virginia;  The AAS sues for peace
       (2116);  A huge flood of refugees pours into the USA;  A "permanent
       ceasefire" is signed, but soon, the entire USA/AAS border (basically
       the 37° parallel, save for Utah and California) becomes a vast
       fortified demilitarized strip, and guerilla warfare continues on both
       sides;  The Idaho Patriotic Militia takes credit for releasing a
       potent bioweapon on Cleveland and killing 109,000;  The AAS claims no
       knowledge (2119);  The USA begins a space program, based in SoCal,
       Hawaii and Puerto Rico (which was never taken by the AAS, although
       attempts were made)

      *Following a Colombian junta, Venezuela moves into Colombia to "restore
       democracy and stability to the region";  Colombia predictably becomes
       a Venezuelan protectorate (2113)

      *The NZSIP calls for another secession vote after a huge sheep epidemic
       is mishandled;  Some say the epidemic was caused by radical South
       Island separatists;  The secessionists carry the vote, with 67% voting
       for secession (2116);  The government of New Zealand declares the vote
       unconstitutional and sends in troops to prevent the secession,
       resulting in civil war

      *Sony, Time-Warner and AT&T merge to become PanMedia (2115)

      *The first full-body transplant is performed in Germany (2119);  The
       patient lives two years before succumbing to massive nervous system
       disintegration and failure;  Later transplants gradually improve on
       this record

      *The first fully-intelligent AI systems are created, but later all are
       abandoned due to fundamental flaws, often leading to severe psychoses
       on the part of the AI's

      *Syrian special forces use BTST weapons in an espionage operation
       against Israel;  Once Israel proves the presence and Syrian origin of
       the weapons, the LSN promptly invades Syria and deposes the
       government, ignoring protests from Syria and its allies

      *Despite extensive engineering, heavy rains 2112-17 cause the Yellow
       River to spill over its banks, making millions homeless;  The Yellow
       River changes course, flowing south of the Shandong Peninsula;  The
       Chinese effort to settle off-earth colonies grows even more intense

      *Interstellar colonization efforts continue, now aimed at Mendoza,
       Nuevo Colombia (DM+50° 1725), Pandora (Ross 878) and Penglai (Kruger
       60)

      *The Czech Republic and Bulgaria join the CESA
       In Japan, Nakajima Hoen invents information sorting ("Inforate"),
      *
       allowing information to be traded directly and quantifiably as a
       commodity
       The Natural Conservation Corporation claims large sections of the
      *Atlantic and Pacific ocean floors and manages to get its claims
       accepted by the LSN, although pirates from various nations continue to
       plague the area for decades;  Two nations are established, Atlantica
       (in the Atlantic, naturally enough) and Pacifica (in the Pacific,
       obviously), both under NCC leadership and with LSN membership

    IMAGE 2120's


      *Several years of independence movements are staunchly opposed by the
       governor of the Jayapura system;  Colonies in the system stage general
       strikes and then revolt;  The First Colony War begins when the LSN
       governor's forces try to crush the revolt (2121);  The colonies at
       Malacca soon follow Jayapura's lead;  After the majority of the LSN
       fleet at Jayapura falls into local control, the governor of Jayapura
       surrenders and Jayapuran forces try to throw the remaining LSN forces
       back to Barnard's;  Malacca is quickly claimed by Jayapura, and LSN
       forces admit defeat (2124)

      *Ramakrishna Ganesh Chandragupta, admiral of the LSN's 5th fleet
       (stationed at Nuevo Colombia), deposes the colonial governor and
       establishes the Mahabharati Empire (2128);  Colonial leaders briefly
       resist, but the colonial ground forces all side with Chandragupta and
       the colonial leaders (as well as holdout LSN forces) soon succumb;  A
       brief attempt at popular resistance fails when Chandragupta makes it
       clear that his battle is with the LSN, not with local sovereignty, and
       he in fact grants local colonies much more sovereignty than they had
       had under the LSN;  The Mahabharati Empire begins colonizing Gandhi
       (AD Leonis) and Indra (WX Ursae Majoris), as well as sending probes to
       various other systems;  The discovery of a garden planet at Rama
       (BD+50° 1725) is kept a highly-classified secret as long as possible,
       effectively until large-scale colonization efforts begin in the 2130's

      *Alaska requests independence from the USA, which grants it;  Alaska
       joins the LSN (2128)

      *The LSN Science Association (the umbrella group for joint LSN
       scientific efforts) begins the Dark Matter Tracking Program (DMTP),
       aimed at mapping all the "dark matter" (grey dwarfs, cold gas, etc.)
       in then-Known Space

      *Cosa Rica forms the Association of Central American Nations (ACAN);
       El Salvador and Nicaragua are forced to join with the so-called War of
       Central American Unification (2127-32), involving several large naval
       actions and three different Cosa Ricans assaults on the Panama Canal
       and Panama (the first two are stopped by US intervention, but
       following a Costa Rican back-room deal to keep shipping in the Canal
       flowing freely, the US becomes neutral and the final Costa Rican
       assault succeeds)

      *Mali, under the Genesis Corporation, incorporates Mauritania (2124)
       and war begins in Western Sahara when Malian agression provokes
       Guinea, Senegal and Morocco to form the West African Coalition in
       resistance (2125);  Mali carves Berbera out of southern Algeria as a
       satellite/buffer state

      *The USA begins its first colonization drive, aimed at Fuxing and
       Auxerre Nouveau;  US colonists soon outnumber the original
       majority-French colonists at Auxerre Nouveau, which soon becomes
       better known as New Sacramento

      *The New Zealand civil war ends with an agreement to give South Island
       voters various economic and political perks, including
       disproportionately-large representation in government (2122);  Critics
       decry the reunification as doomed to fail and vastly unfair
       The CESA nations eradicate all trade barriers between them (2126);
      *
       Under the leadership of Hrothgar Jemnis, the CESA grows to become a
       very powerful and prosperous alliance
       The Document of War system is formally enacted in the LSN, replacing
      *the previous war-by-consensus system (in which any LSN nation could
       war against any other if 75% of LSN members voted to allow it)

      *The Second Colony War begins when Petit-Sol revolts (2128);  The
       Interstellar Commerce Alliance (ICA) is established there with great
       amounts of (mainly local) corporate support;  LSN forces briefly offer
       resistance but then withdraw when insufficient resolution to support
       the war is forthcoming from the LSN command;  The ICA initially takes
       a staunchly anti-LSN stance;  The former LSN governor of Petit-Sol,
       Jean-Paul Feroux, is captured while fleeing and is sentenced to death
       for "human rights infractions," and sentenced to death on the same
       date that the inhabitants of the Pandora's Box were killed;  Human
       Rights Day is established as an ICA holiday on the date of Feroux's
       death;  The ICA gains control of LSN naval forces in Petit-Sol, with
       which they overwhelm LSN forces at Luyten (2128-29);  However,
       following this, the LSN treats the ICA as an equal and takes a very
       meek stance;  Relations between the ICA and LSN begin to warm, though
       slowly

      *The admiral of the LSN fleet at Sirius, Bartholomew Harris, rebels,
       seizes control of both Sirius and Pandora, declares the Sirian
       Autonomous Republic (SAR) and blocks all colony-ships from Earth, all
       within the short period of three months (2124);  The SAR's tightly
       efficient forces soon take Procyon from the disillusioned, dispirited
       and beleaguered LSN defenders there

      *Black, Inc., the legitimate arm of the Black Association (a very large
       criminal syndicate) claims a strip of the ocean floor as its territory
       and begins mining it, but the LSN rejects the claim and finally
       removes Black only by force (2127)

      *Syria, having thrown off LSN direct control (due to its earlier use of
       BTST's), soon begins fighting with Badiyat again



       Back to top - to the Spheres page - to ARCADIA - to my main page


    IMAGE 2130's


      *Jayapura and Malacca set up a mutual-defense agreement, the
       Jayapura-Malacca Defense Coalition (2132), then make a grab for
       Barnard's but are roundly defeated by a concerted LSN effort to defend
       Barnard's

      *The ICA begins a colonization drive aimed at Kapteyn's (Kapteyn's
       Star) and Freehaven (Tau Ceti)

      *The first signs of the Wall are noticed;  The rate of scientific
       progress seems slowed throughout Known Space;  Agriculture, long-since
       dependent almost entirely upon technology to keep up with population
       expansion, begins to fail and starvation spreads;  Many corporations
       (particularly research-oriented ones) also fail

      *After two years of secret communiques, Fuxing and New Sacramento's
       governors rebel against the LSN;  The LSN, now rather tired of
       fighting, allows the systems' independence (2133);  The admiral of the
       Fuxing naval fleet, Ding Huilong, rebels himself against Fuxing's
       governor and starts the Fuxing War (2134);  Fuxing and New Sacramento
       establish the Independent Systems' Confederation (ISC), and also
       legalize privateering (the equipping of private space vessels with
       military weapons) to fight Ding's fleet;  The Fuxing War continues;
       ISC privateers make a side-grab for Penglai, without official ISC
       permission (but with tacit permission, many claim);  The LSN decides
       to give military assistance to Ding, giving him renewed legitimacy and
       power, but it is too little, too late, and the now well-established
       ISC takes Penglai as reparations for Ding's 'war crimes' (2137);
       Through it all, New Ohio (V1581 Cygni) is colonized by the ISC;  The
       Fuxing War continues, even though Ding's LSN support is soon severed
       Several of Earth's corporations (many of whom gave assistance to the
      *
       ICA) begin moving back into the ICA, first with trade and then slowly
       with contract resettlement;  Nationstates of the LSN slowly follow
       suit, and ICA-LSN relations begin to normalize
       80% of ex-UN members are now LSN members
      *
      *ACAN takes Panama, then applies for LSN entry and is accepted "in
       spite of past crimes" (2130)

      *Venezuela joins the LSN (2135);  Brazil protests but is powerless to
       prevent the event, as it is not an LSN member itself yet

      *The Mahabharati Empire swings the focus of its colonization efforts
       towards the so-called "Back Route" between Nuevo Colombia and Procyon,
       settling Deva (LTT12353), Rama and Yan (L387-102), but especially
       focused on Rama and its pristine garden world, now dubbed Eden

      *When the SAR tries to disrupt trade in Kapteyn's, the ICA makes an
       armed response, quickly escalating into open war (2135);  ICA and
       Mahabharati representatives at Earth meet and agree to a joint attack
       on SAR forces, but the actual resulting Mahabharati effort is
       lackluster at best;  Nonetheless, the SAR collapses into internal
       conflict under consistent ICA pressure (2139), resulting in a brief
       power vacuum in the Sirius, Francisco and Pandora systems;  A joint
       LSN-ICA force, the two spheres first cooperative effort, takes over
       the government of the former SAR, but due to ICA-LSN hesitance (to
       overextend themselves) and reluctance (to work with each other), law
       and order are minimal;  Many regional warlords, small republics and
       outright anarchic settlements soon emerge in the former SAR systems

      *Triads gain access to DMTP files and choose a fairly well-endowed grey
       dwarf as their site for a huge inter-system base;  The grey dwarf,
       nicknamed Hidden Ember, is located about half-way between the LSN, ICA
       and Mahabharati spheres;  The main station at Hidden Ember, Chang'an,
       is completed in 2139 under extremely tight security and secrecy

      *With Earth's reserves of fossil fuels largely dried up, the OPEC
       nations meet to decide on a course of action;  Venezuela and other
       non-Arabian countries choose to leave the near-useless organization
       and go their own ways;  Saudi Arabia proposes a free-trade zone and
       the remaining OPEC nations agree to the idea;  An agreement is made to
       create the Arab Free Trade Union (AFTU), with no internal trade
       restrictions (and few external ones), within 25 years

      *The war in Western Sahara ends (2130);  Mali (under the Genesis
       Corporation) gains only the southern part of Western Sahara;  The
       southern part of the former Mauritania becomes a WAC protectorate;
       The WAC forms a free-trade zone, also including Sierra Leone, Liberia
       and Ivory Coast (2130);  By the end of the decade, MAli and the WAC
       nations are again trading peacefully

      *Bertrand Delacroix, the 17th richest person alive, repudiates his
       Quebec citizenship and attempts to gain status as a sovereign
       one-person nation in the LSN, but fails after lengthy LSN debate
       (2138);  Delacroix instead accepts citizenship with several of the
       corporations in which he owns stock

      *The Tsong Kha Pa, carrying approximately 600 esoteric Buddhists,
       disappears en route to Groombridge 34;  The Tsong Kha Pa's
       disappearance is, to date, one of the biggest mysteries in Known
       Space;  many stories arise about a "Shangri-La in space"

          2140's

       The Wall starts to peak;  Billions die due to unsustainable growth and
      *general starvation;  A "back to basics" movement spreads throughout
       Known Space, emphasizing simple sustainable agriculture as its guiding
       principle;  "Port riots" occur at many spaceports, especially at
       orbital cable installations, as starving mobs gather to demand food
       from off-Earth;  Spaceports become more and more fortified;
       Lawlessness spreads far and wide when farmers are displaced from their
       lands, and migrant laborers find sources of work drying up;  The LSN
       concurrently increases power centralization at the expense of member
       nations;  Madras Regional Port is briefly taken over by criminals and
       becomes, for a short time, the world's dominant smuggling center;
       Occurring during the monsoon of 2147, the euphemism "Madras rainy
       season" enters the popular vocabulary, meaning criminal or illicit
       activities;  Riots in Vladivostok are pacified by a joint
       Korean-Chinese-Japanese force (2148), and Russia is forced to accept
       the joint force's continued occupation of the port;  The population of
       Earth itself reaches its highest level to date sometime in 2148, with
       around 13 billion people

      *80% of colonists in off-Earth LSN colonies gain independence through
       rebellion, protest or petition;  Most remain within the LSN, gaining
       their own seats in government

      *Hrothgar Jemnis is assassinated (2141), but his killer is never
       identified

      *As population pressures and hunger increase, many systems begin trying
       to shift their populations to unsettled regions, often across sphere
       borders;  The LSN reaches agreements with the ICA and JMDC specifying
       maximum emigration from Earth (2145), but the quotas are rarely
       obeyed, and a booming grey market springs up in resettlement;  The
       JMDC grows increasingly incensed, and finally begins patrolling the
       JMDC-LSN trade routes and firing upon colonist-carrying ships which do
       not turn back;  When the JMDC presses the patrols to the Oort cloud of
       Barnard's, the JMDC and LSN go to war with each other (2148);  No
       agreements are reached initially, but both sides eventually tire of
       the conflict and agree to new quotas, this time slightly more
       favorable to the JMDC;  The population balances of many spheres change
       greatly;  By the end of the decade, more than a billion people live
       off-Earth

      *Mali, as ever under Genesis corporate administration, peacefully
       incorporates Niger, whose population openly votes to do so;  Mali
       petitions for LSN membership, and is successful in spite of Nigerian
       protests (2147);  The Genesis corporation moves people off-Earth at a
       huge and growing rate

      *Mozambique assumes control over southern Tanzania (south of the Ruaha)
       after rioting and refugees spill over into Mozambique

      *As part of the AFTU effort, Saudi Arabia and Jordan broker peace
       between Badiyat and Syria

      *The ISC, vicotrious over Admiral Ding, colonizes Spectre (Groombridge
       34) and briefly attempts to take Barnard's from the LSN but is
       thoroughly repulsed (2146);  The LSN, going on the offensive (and
       growing desperate for colonization space), begins attacking New
       Sacramento;  Peace is finally reached in the New Durban Accords,
       signed at Luyten (2149)

      *Faced with a growing domestic population and ever-increasing numbers
       of refugees from Earth, the Mahabharati leadership decides to invade
       Qiqiu space;  A huge Mahabharati fleet briefly tries to conquer Qiqiu
       space but is soon defeated;  Freed from Mahabharati domination,
       socialist forces at Rama and Deva revolt (2148);  Rama and Deva are
       renamed Egality and Liberty (respectively), and declare themselves to
       be the Sapient People's Republic (SPR);  The Mahabharati fleet is sent
       to quell the SPR uprising, but due to over-reliance on space-based
       forces and Qiqiu aid to the SPR, the Mahabharati Empire is forced to
       acknowledge SPR independence;  However, as part of the independence
       agreement, the SPR continues to allow large numbers of immigrants to
       Egality and its garden world, Eden;  During the SPR's war of
       independence, the Egality Fusiliers become famous as guerilla
       fighters;  The SPR begins colonization of Haagen (L674-15);
       Mahabharati forces subsequently withdraw from Yan as well, leaving
       various small powers in their wake (2148)

      *Riots in the South African protectorates of Zambia and Zimbabwe result
       in an attempt at "pacification" by a joint Congolese/Katangan force;
       South African forces oppose the Congolese and Katangan soldiers, and
       war ensues;  All three powers (South Africa, Katanga and Congo) sign a
       Document of War (2143);  South Africa is victorious and subsequently
       enjoys almost unchallenged dominance over southern Africa for several
       decades

      *The JMDC discovers the Babylon (Delta Pavonis) system's large, humid
       garden planet, Ur;  Primitive sapient quadropeds, dubbed the Shojin,
       are discovered but not contacted;  A strict non-contact,
       non-interference policy is established, but as the Shojin are
       restricted to two of Ur's six continents, settlement begins apace
       elsewhere
       A brief resurgence in fighting between the USA and AAS is stopped by
      *
       the LSN because neither party had signed a Document of War
       After the majority of LSN troops are removed from Sirius (largely to
      *guard against further port riots), ICA forces assume control of the
       system with a minimum of bloodshed;  An LSN-ICA agreement guarantees
       continued resettlement to Sirius from Earth in exchange for LSN
       recognition of ICA sovereignty over Sirius

      *Bengal ("India") and an Assam-Dravidian alliance skirmish then go into
       full battle, sparking the Indus War (2144);  All sides concerned sign
       Documents of War and begin fighting through Bangladesh, which is
       powerless to resist (due to its not being an LSN member);  Assamese
       troops advance to the lower Jamuna;  Bengali forces advance to the
       lower Ganges;  The Battle of Dacca, a long, drawn-out Bengali
       bombardment of Assamese forces stationed in the city followed by two
       months of intense street-fighting, kills over 300,000 (2147), the
       deadliest battle to date in human history;  Dravidia takes a large
       part of Orissa;  The Bangladeshi government flees to exile in
       Thailand;  The upper triangle of Bangladesh is declared a "free
       demilitarized zone"

      *Germany, under a Nationalist government, briefly withdraws from the
       LSN in order to retake Alsace-Lorraine, but LSN troops stop the action
       and Germany withdraws, cowed;  Several out-system German colonies
       rebel and are granted independence by the LSN;  The Nationalists soon
       lose power

      *The WAC countries agree to unify as a single state by 2175;  Sierra
       Leone votes to join the state as well (2142)

    IMAGE 2150's


      *The Wall continues, although deaths begin to decrease in number;  Many
       believe that Earth has reached a sustainable population, around 10.5
       billion;  Neo-Luddite movements spread far and wide;  Many settlements
       enact anti-technology laws (limiting either technological research or
       reliance)

      *JMDC elections give a landslide victory to the Islamic Socialist Party
       (2152);  The JMDC's institutions are gradually changed to a somewhat
       more Islamic model and finally the name JMDC is officially changed to
       the simply descriptive Islamic Sphere (2155);  The Islamic Sphere
       colonizes Ibrahim (Lacaille 9352)

      *A Slovenian military coup threatens Austria's massive investment
       there, prompting Austrian forces to annex Slovenia;  Traditionalist
       and nationalist Austrian groups are quite pleased and call for a
       return to the Austrian Empire;  A distant relative of the Hapsburgs
       founds the Austrian Empire Party

      *Following the SPR debacle, Ramakrishna Ganesh Chandragutpa's son,
       Asoka Kalidasa Chandragupta, is killed by an assassin, reportedly
       hired by several of the Mahabharati fleet's admirals (2150);  Gandhi
       and Siva refuse to acknowledge Asoka's successor, Sivaratnam
       Chandragupta (a distant cousin favorable to the fleet admirals), while
       declaring themselves independent under their own royal head;  The
       Mahabharati Empire falls into civil war;  The main Mahabharati fleet,
       under Sivaratnam, goes to war against Siva and Gandhi, both of which
       grow to depend on the SPR and Qiqiu for support;  Finally, the LSN
       enters the war against Sivaratnam in exchange for trading rights and
       guaranteed immigration quotas from Gandhi and Siva, as well as
       military bases with extraterritoriality;  The LSN forces tip the
       balance, and Sivaratnam's forces lose the war (2155);  The Gandhi-Siva
       forces establish a much more liberal regime, but still a dynastic one

      *The SPR colonizes Progress (YZ Canis Major) and Victory (Ross 619)
       Chen Yongxing, a warlord in charge of a major trading empire and fleet
      *
       at Yan, unites the Yan system under his control, declaring the Yan
       Empire (2151);  Chen sets about conquering Francisco (2154) then
       Pandora (2159), both of which fall with little local resistance;
       Francisco is renamed Fuyuan and Pandora is renamed Zhongwu;  Chen
       simultaneously encourages pirate activity to disrupt trade throughout
       the "Back Route";  In response, the ICA begins selling "boomer rights"
       (licenses to carry ship-to-ship class weapons on semi-private vessels,
       thus effectively creating privateers), basically aimed at defeating
       Yan forces;  Pirate activity increases throughout Known Space,
       especially in the Back Route
       Peru moves to take northern Bolivia and Chile, and is successful
      *(2155)

      *Raiding and banditry in Somalia result in the complete collapse of the
       government (the official LSN representatives flee to Egypt, and the
       country becomes effectively an anarchy);  After raiding spreads into
       Ethiopia and Kenya (particularly the latter, which has weathered the
       Wall much better than its neighbors), the two nations gain approval
       with 75% of the LSN Parliament to invade Somalia, thereby dispensing
       with the need of signing a Document of War with a non-existent
       government;  Somalia is quickly divided up between Ethiopia and Kenya
       (2152)

      *Following huge protests on the north island, New Zealand again splits,
       but peacefully this time (2153)

      *Eastern Siberia erupts into war when Russian forces attempt to cut
       Vladivostok and its occupying Korean-Chinese-Japanese force from
       landline resources (water, fiberop, etc.);  The Chinese and Korean
       forces fight back, pushing towards Yakutsk in order to secure a
       "defensive perimeter" around Vladivostol;  Japanese forces soon follow
       (after extensive debate in the Diet);  All sides concerned sign a
       Document of War and the LSN therefore remains neutral;  Russian forces
       are soon pounded into submission and sue for peace;  The Amur and
       Sichote Republic is established with Vladivostok as its capital
       (2158);  The ASR is soon granted LSN membership, although Russia
       refuses to acknowledge the ASR's status, and indeed never does;  A
       military coup soon follows in Russia, leading to several years of
       martial law and many attempts at sovereignty by local governments

      *Just barely meeting the 25-year deadline, the AFTU is finalized;
       Several free trade ports are set up, including Kuwait City, Abu Dhabi
       and Aden at first;  The ports are soon flourishing as centers of
       (among other things) infopro

      *France invades the Channel Islands in order to protect the now
       majority-French population from disproportionate taxation under
       Britain;  Britain is nearly ready to concede defeat when Germany
       offers military assistance to the British;  Britain agrees and the
       British-German force routs the French (2150);  All sides concerned
       sign a Document of War, so LSN forces never intervene;  The Channel
       Island Resistance Front begins a terrorist insurgency against the
       occupying British and German forces

      *The CESA nations agree to liberate portions of Poland controlled by
       Germany, avoiding any reference to Ukraine-occupied Poland;  Germany
       and the CESA members sign a Document of War (2155);  Prague is
       destroyed, and the German forces fight hard, but the CESA eventually
       succeeds in liberating the portion of POland south of the Warta
       (2159);  The liberated area, called simply Poland, is established with
       its capital at Wroclaw, and POland joins the CESA and (later) the
       LSN;  German forces briefly use BTST weapons but the CESA is unable to
       prove it;  The Austrian Empire Party, playing on anti-CESA sentiment,
       rockets to power;  The Wurtemberg-Bavaria Independence Army (WBIA)
       emerages, reportedly under CESA or Austrian tutelage

      *The DMTP is taken over by the LSN's Exploration Service

      *The ICA, in spite of the Wall, colonizes the Tetsuyama (Omicron
       Eridani) system

      *Following the increased success of the WAC countries, the Francophone
       African League (LFA), composed of Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon,
       Congo and the DRC, votes to become a free-trade/mutual defense
       alliance

       The Wall largely subsides
      *
      *Discovery of the Thomas-Ng-Duc object (aka the Artifact) near the
       Babylon system, by DMTP scouts;  "High Islam" and "optical Islam" soon
       follow, and the TND object becomes the object of a new Hajj;  DMTP
       scientists estimate that TND-type objects may make up a large part of
       the "missing mass" of the universe

      *Brazil joins the LSN (2162), one of the last superpowers to do so

      *The Hamburg Flu kills 1.2 million in the Baltic states, particularly
       Denmark;  Ukraine institutes very rough inspection measures for those
       traveling from Western Europe

      *Nigeria attempts to grab the Gold Coast countries by force;  The WAC,
       in its first major military test, routs Nigeria (2166-69), though
       admittedly with a large reliance on Philips security forces

      *The legislature of Utah votes to leave the AAS and rejoin the USA, but
       the state's governor vetoes the resolution;  At the peak of a
       legislative/gubernatorial showdown, the governor orders the arrest of
       seventeen members of Utah legislature on treason charges;  Fourteen of
       them flee to Colorado, but twelve are caught en route and summarily
       executed, sparking a renewal of USA-AAS hostilities (2167)

      *Greece briefly attempts to invade Macedonia (in the former
       Yugoslavia), but is turned back by LSN forces because Macedonia has
       not signed a Document of War;  The LSN imposes a provisional
       government on Greece (2161)

      *Following rioting throughout eastern Russia and a second military
       coup, Ukraine moves to take the Volga-Caspia corridor to secure its
       Crimean possessions, and Russian coup forces resist;  Both sides sign
       a Document of War, igniting the Second Crimean War (2162);  Georgia
       pushes to the Kyma to "protect" its borders;  The war continues until
       Finland intervenes against Russia, pressing its ancient claim to the
       lands around Lake Ladoga (2165);  Russia is forced to accept the
       losses;  The coup fails;  When Russian colonists in Ukrainian-run
       outsystem colonies revolt, they are violently suppressed, nearly (but
       not quite) leading to a recurrence of hositilities on Earth

      *Dravidia and Bengal (which still has not officially forsaken the name
       "India") join the LSN (in 2160 and 2164, respectively);  No other
       south Asian states are eligible for membership at this time due to
       economic imbalance

      *Jordan and Saudi Arabia and reunited peacefully into Arabia, followed
       by Yemen (2161);  Late in the decade, Qatar and the United Arab
       Emierates follow suit (2168-69);  The newly potent Arabia is careful
       not to monopolize power in the AFTU, though;  Israel requests AFTU
       membership and is warmly accepted

      *The ISC colonizes the Novy Kiev (Altair) system, although the actual
       colonization effort has almost no government backing
       Supported by British and Thorn-EMI forces, Provence rebels against
      *
       France;  A short, un-Documented conflict ensues, but France soon gives
       up (2161) and Provence joins the LSN;  Britain funds a separatist
       movement in Brittany
       Three relatively small small corps in the ICA independently colonize
      *the Chihai (LTT1702) system;  Mutual conflicts over borders and
       jurisdiction nearly result in war, until the three sides agree to
       accept ICA arbitration;  None of the corps is willing to accept direct
       ICA rule (which would mean a loss of control over their investments in
       the system), so a trilateral ruling corp, the Chihai Trilateral, is
       set up

      *The Starwhales announce themselves to the Islamic Sphere with a
       message beamed to Ur in perfect Arabic (2178);  Peaceful relations are
       established and trade grows quickly;  The Starwhales introduce a
       variety of biotech to humanity

      *Colonists from the Islamic Sphere independently explore and settle the
       Tashkent (70 Ophiuchi) system, eventually setting up a loose
       confederation with the powers-that-be of the Novy Kiev system;  More
       and more people begin calling the two systems the "Back Stretch"

      *Following the enactment of an Islamic Sphere-wide law requiring all
       citizens to own a copy of the Koran, huge protests spread throughout
       the Islamic Sphere and beyond;  Especially large riots on Ur turn
       violent and are suppressed with military force;  Rioting spreads and
       force follows in its wake;  An estimated 117,000 are killed (2171);
       The "Koran law" is withdrawn, and a long-debated law guaranteeing
       religious freedom is enacted;  Many religious leaders, especially
       non-Islamic ones, preach defiance of the new law, which is seen as a
       "sham" and "insufficient reconciliation" for the killing;  Several
       Christian groups begin terrorist action;  One such group successfully
       detonates a 100 GT nuclear device near the TND Object, destroying
       several stations including a large mosque and killing 23,900;  The
       Object itself is completely unscratched

      *The DMTP ends, considered a moderate success;  No other TND-type
       objects are discovered, dwarf stars are far less numerous than
       expected and no cosmic strings are ever detected;  Most importantly,
       the overall mass of the universe remains a mystery;  However, vast
       amounts of stellar and interstellar data are collected, and
       interstellar trade in general is noted to have increased approximately
       twofold during the DMTP

      *Eight major pirate groups and the major Triad and Yakuza groups meet
       at Chang'an, resulting in the founding of the Universal Syndicate, the
       most powerful criminal organization to date in Known Space

      *Three of the SPR's seven fleet admirals rebel and claim sovereignty
       over the systems in which they are stationed (Haagen, Bayeux and
       Victory);  The admirals proclaim their systems to be the High Kingdom
       (2171), and fighting immediately begins with the SPR

      *The Utah War ends with the AAS is complete control of the state (2174)

      *Iraq, with the lowest GDP of any AFTU nation and complainign of
       exploitation by its fellow AFTU-members, quits the Union and erects
       fierce trade barriers against AFTU member states;  Reports spread of
       actual infotage by Iraq against the AFTU
       Syria, Badiyat and Lebanon reunite to form Sharqiah
      *
       The LFA members, enjoying a high degree of success in their trade
      *grouping, agree to unite as a single state by 2225 (2173)

      *The state of West Africa is formed on schedule;  A president is
       peacefully and democratically elected, and West Africa joins the LSN
       (2175);  The Genesis corporation's CEO, disgusted at the West African
       developments, briefly tries to cease involvement in Mali but poular
       support convinces the Board to fire the CEO and stay in Mali

      *The Austrian Empire Party is elected to power and declares openly its
       intention to retake former Hapsburg lands;  Under the excuse of
       humanitarian aid following a moderate earthquake and blight, Austria
       invades Croatia (2172) and absorbs it;  Croatian elections show
       support, and the LSN is unable to intervene in spite of worldwide
       condemnation;  The CESA nations take strong notice and enact trade
       sanctions against Austria, but the AEP stands firm;  The AEP steps up
       efforts to incite anti-CESA activity in Hungary and Yugoslavia, as
       well as increasing aid to the WBIA, although Dalmatian separatists
       (aided by CESA operatives) soon begin creating trouble at home for
       Austria

      *The Japanese begin reclaiming a large part of the Inland Sea (from
       Matsuyama in the west to Awaji in the east), thereby both
       'eliminating' pollution and greatly increasing arable land available;
       The plan continues despite environmentalists' protests;  The
       reclamation continues to the present but is not yet complete

      *Scientists at Ibrahim use an anti-matter charge to destroy a comet on
       a collision course with a major station (2178);  This is the first
       major use of anti-matter weapons

      *The first ISC resurvey of BD +59° 1915in five years discovers a
       newly-established alien colony;  Contact is made with the Hammerheads
       (2183), and the ISC soon begins trading with them

      *The Chihai Trilateral falls apart, igniting war (2185);  The ICA
       officially maintains neutrality, although ICA privateers fight on all
       sides

      *Bengal and Gujarat ally to take Kashmir from Pakistan, signing a
       Document of War given them by Pakistan;  Bengal and Gujarat are
       successful (2184), though their alliance soon falls apart and Pakistan
       begins to retake Kashmir, inch by inch

      *Espionage and price warring between PanMedia and Alpha Bank escalate
       to outright war (2186-88);  In the ICA, PanMedia and AlphaBank
       privateers endanger trade routes and bring overall inter-system trde
       down by 13%;  The Alpha Dollar loses value greatly throughout Known
       Space, causing several system-wide depressions;  The L4 War occurs
       when PanMedia and AlphaBank habitats in Earth orbit begin attacking
       each other (largely with infotage, but also with missiles, etc.);  The
       war ends with ICA arbitration, not (as many critics note) LSN help
       Following the bombing of the Trans-Siberian bullet line, Russia
      *
       invades the ASR, receiving German and South African help to do so;
       The ASR loses a great deal of land, but the intervention of Japanese
       troops on the ASR side brings the fighting to a standstill (2184)
       The president of Iraq picks a fight over the long-disputed "Neutral
      *zone" between Iraq and Arabia, igniting war between the AFTU nations
       and Iraq (2186);  Documents of War are signed by all sides concerned

      *A small war emerges between the Democratic Republic of Congo and
       Uganda;  Uganda's government reports that the DRC has no Document of
       War to justify its actions, and the LSn intervenes, crushing the DRC
       forces (2180);  The war ends, and Uganda emerges quite well-off;
       Later investigation proves that both sides had in fact signed
       Documents, but Ugandan infotage operatives had destroyed all Document
       records on both sides when the war appeared to be going badly;
       Uganda's government is in turn deposed by LSN troops (2182) and the
       LSN begins filing all Documents of War centrally

      *With support from South Africa, Philips and Germany, Nigeria gets
       enough votes in the LSN Parliament to allow another attempt at taking
       the Gold Coast countries by force;  Nigeria conquers a swath from
       Biafra to just short of Monrovia (2182)

      *Burkina Faso, once a Nigerian satellite, allies itself with Mali under
       the explicit intention to join Mali within a few years (2189);
       Nigeria goes to war to prevent such a loss of face, not to mention
       assets in Burkina Faso;  Both sides sign Documents of War;  Genesis
       pulls out all the stops and, although Nigeria receives aid from South
       Africa as well as Philips, an orbital bombardment of Maiduguri
       followed by the occupation of Lagos by orbital shock troops convinces
       Nigeria to accept the loss of Burkina Faso (2190);  Genesis, in firm
       control of Burkina Faso, annuls Mali as a state and announces the
       foundation of the Songhay Republic in its place

      *The CESA nearly collapses when Yugoslavian jingoists take power there
       and threaten to invade Hungary;  The jingoists publish all CESA
       military codes publicly, causing a massive crisis in the CESA armies,
       as well as resulting in the disappearance of many military weapons,
       including several nuclear ones;  The Austrian Empire (as it is now
       called) takes the opportunity to annex Bosnia-Hercegovina, again
       citing humanitarian reasons, then manages at the last moment to gain
       enough LSN support to avoid punitive action by the LSN itself;
       Yugoslavia and Hungary finally agree to a CESA-brokered peace, and the
       CESA finally settles down

      *The ACAN begins skirmishing with Mexico over possession of the Yucatan
       and environs (2187);  No Documents of War are signed, but neither side
       is unwilling to fight, so the LSN has no reason to intervene

      *The SPR and High Kingdom sign a ceasefire (2191), but the peace breaks
       down (2193)

      *The Chihai war stops with a clear state of affairs (2194);  Chihai
       eventually begins rebuilding and eventually sends colonists to
       Dardanelles (82 Eridani), discovering the large garden planet there
       (Constantinople)

      *Independent colonists from Tashkent and Novy Kiev settle Caspia
       (DM+04° 4048)
       A coalition of Christian and Muslim leaders in the Islamic Sphere call
      *
       for a holy war against the Starwhales;  No national governments take
       the call seriously, but several boomers and other privateers take part
       in the so-called "High Crusade";  A joint Islamic Sphere-Starwhale
       navy defeats the 'crusade' soundly (2194-95);  A peace-minded
       coalition in the Islamic Sphere's senate proposes a constitutional
       clause explicitly stating that humans are not the only creatures in
       the universe possessed of souls, but the measure is ominously defeated
       by a wide margin
       A series of plebiscites in Bavaria (2190, 2192 and 2194) finally
      *results in a vote for independence;  The Austrian Empire demands
       voiceferously that Germany grant Bavaria immediate independence;
       Germany schedules a binding public vote for 2199; The vote is against
       independence, but Austria and the WBIA declare the vote rigged; The
       WBIA declares itself the official government of Bavaria, then
       "invites" Austrian forces to help itself into power; Austrian forces
       invade Germany, German forces counter them, and the LSN intervenes
       because no Dcuments of War have been signed, even though Austria
       maintains that it is not officially at war; Both Austrian and German
       forces are soon pushed out of Austria by LSN forces (2199); The LSN
       itself then enforces Bavaria's neutrality and schedules a full, final
       vote on independence for 2205

      *France tries to retake Provence but is again rebuffed (2194); Provence
       begins assisting the Breton independence movement
      *Greece becomes embroiled in a civil war when a coalition of generals
       attempts to stage a coup over the 30-year-old LSN-imposed
       "provisional" government; Bulgaria invades to support the junta,
       signing a Document of War (2198) Turkey signs a Document then takes
       most of the Aegean

      *Nekya, with considerable investments in southern Sudan but no interest
       in the country's impoverished north, begins assisting the south's
       independence movement (which has been active for at least two
       centuries); Ethiopia soon joins Kenya in supporting the South in order
       to lessen Sudanese power

      *Kashmir is retaken by Pakistan (with strong backing from a mixed group
       of corporate allies); A formal proposal in the LSN Parliament that the
       Indian states peacefully reunite is widely laughed at, then nearly
       forgotten

      *The Iraq-AFTU war ends with a stalemate (2192), but only because the
       AFTU never really makes a concerted effort to cripple Iraq's warmaking
       potential; Iraq agrees to drop its anti-AFTU tariffs, and the AFTU
       agrees to invest heavily in Iraq's infrastructure, though the idea of
       Iraq rejoining the AFTU is considered only a dim and distant
       possibility

      *Following another attempt by Russia to retake the Amur and Sichote
       Republic (2193), rebuffed by LSN troops, Russia makes a proposal to
       dissolve the LSN; Russia cites as its main complaint the LSN's
       excessive interference in nations' internal affairsl Most other
       countries dismiss Russia's proposal as self-serving, but the banner of
       LSN dissolution is taken up by Nigeria and Brazil, who propose the
       idea persistently over the next decade; Anti-LSN activity gains
       exposure

      *New Zealand voters agree by a 60 to 40% margin to reunify (2198); Many
       terrorist organizations form in the reunited island state

      *The ACAN and Mexico sign a peace treaty, giving the eastern Yucatan to
       the ACAN (2195)

          2200's

       Several private organizations scout the space to the negative Z of
      *
       Dardanelles, discovering and contacting the Tripods; The Tripods
       immediately begin warring against humanity (2205); The ICA begins
       selling boomer rights again, and privateers swarm around and across
       the ICA's -Z border; The Tripods release the Chlorophage and other BCW
       agents onto Constantinople (2206), devastating the planet's biosphere,
       the take the entire Dardanelles system by storm; The Tripods also
       easily defeat a massed privateer defense of Chihai (2207); Three of
       the ICA's six main fleets are sent to Tetsuyama to defeat it when
       listening posts detect unknown signals outside the Tetsuyama Oort; The
       Tripods invade Tetsuyama, and although the ICA fleets are victorious,
       it is pyrrhic as the Tripods are able to regroup and flee, leaving the
       ICA fleets at approximately 15% of full strength; The ICA finally and
       hesitantly agrees to allow LSN and Islamic Sphere military vessels
       into ICA space in order to defend Tetsuyama, Kapteyn's, Freehaven and
       most of all Petit-Sol; All the while, no Tripod vessels are detected
       anywhere near the Babylon system, even though it is quite close to the
       Tripods' sphere; The Tripods invade Tetsuyama again, taking it (2208),
       but in a series of battles near Tetsuyama, Kapteyn's and Freehaven,
       the combined human fleets defeat the Tripods soundly; The combined
       human fleets then move to retake Tetsuyama and are successful (2209);
       The Tripods cease advancing, and inter-sphere squabbling prevents the
       human forces from counter-attacking; A stalemate sets in (2209-10)
       Arguments about dissolving the LSN fizzle when LSN fleets make an
      *excellent showing against the Tripods

      *The LSN begins the DMTP II;  Although briefly interrupted at the
       beginning of the Tripod War, DMTP II soon begins mapping and exploring
       new areas of space;  Exploration occurs only in several rather narrow
       corridors, though, due to other nations' discomfort with having LSN
       scouts (often military-grade vessels with extensive
       intelligence-gathering capabilities) in their own Spheres;  DMTP II
       continues to the present

      *The south of Sudan is recognized by the LSN as an independent nation,
       El Sudd; Sudan resigns from the LSN in protest

      *Following attempts by Korean agents to foment Manchurian unrest, China
       pulls out of the ASR (2202) and comes close to signing a Document of
       War against Korea, but finally stands down

      *Bengal invades the Free Demilitarized Zone in northern Bangladesh
       (2206); Assam, still not an LSN member, is helpless to resist; Bengal
       turns a blind eye to illicit activities in the Zone, and in fact
       begins taxing them in some areas

      *The Greek civil war ends (2203) with a new democratic system being
       instituted; Bulgarian receives many concessions in trade, etc., as
       well as part of the north Aegean coast, up to the Strimon river;
       Several parts o Greece are also made into free trade zones; Turkey
       invades northern Cyprus and defeats the local (Greek) government, then
       gives power over to northern Cyprus (2204); Greece is unwilling to
       sign a Document of War to help the Greek Cypriot government, and the
       Greek Cypriots have nearly no other allies; The CESA stays firmly
       neutral throughout the whole Greek conflict, but maintains a fairly
       congratulatory attitude towards Bulgaria, long since a member of the
       CESA

      *The Bavarian plebiscite is held two years late (22050, resulting in
       victory for the pro-Austrian parties, and Austrian annexation of
       Bavaria; Germany accepts the loss, though the German premier vows to
       "right these wrongs" at some point in the future, "allowing the German
       people to stand tall and proud again"; Austria, on the other hand, is
       pressured by its own foreign allies to grant independence to Dalmatia,
       which immediately joins the CESA (2208)

      *A popular election in Bretagne gives victory to a separatist
       coalition; Brittany declares itself a sovereign state, and France
       grants Brittany independence after months of debate (2206)

      *Several religious groups projecting a civilization-wide collapse to
       happen in 2200 are disappointed; Some consider the Tripod war to be
       the cataclysm, but many believe that Armageddon will occur in 2222
       instead

       The Corridor War, also known as the Tripod War, flares up again with a
      *
       renewed Tripod offensive; The -Z ICA worlds are traded back and forth
       betweent he Tripods and the human alliance nearly a dozen times
       (2210); At one point, the Tripods even take Kapteyn's, though they
       still mysteriously keep their distance from Babylon and Petit-Sol;
       General intersphere human cooperation increases greatly; However, the
       Mahabharati Empire takes advantage of the LSN's reduced defenses to
       attack and capture the Wolf system (2212); LSN reserve forces and ICA
       privateers retake the system for the LSN by 2214, though; In 2215, a
       lull sets in as a huge Tripod advances to Dardanelles then simply sits
       for several months, with no explanation for their inaction and minimal
       skirmishing; The exact reason for their passivity remains a mystery,
       but the rebuilding of the systems unlucky enough to be the theater of
       war commences; The first non-corporate intersphere organization, the
       Human Space Defense Alliance (HSDA) is established with the LSN,
       Islamic Sphere, ISC and ICA as charter members; Captured Tripod
       missiles introduce humanity to K-D field harmonics and several other
       technologies
       The High Kingdom briefly takes Liberty's outer settlements but is
      *routed (2218); The High Kingdom-SPR war continues nonetheless

      *Assam finally gains LSN membership, foreshadowing possible peace on
       the indian subcontinent

      *Bulgaria invades European Turkey with the excuse that Turkey is
       blocking shipping in the Aegean, and to the Greek free ports (which it
       is); Bulgaria and Turkey sign Documents of War (2217), then CESA
       forces join the fight on the Bulgarian side, and Ankara soon falls
       (2219); The capital of Turkey is moved to Adana; Kurdistan signs on
       with the CESA forces, invading the eastern part of Turkey, then
       Georgia does the same; Greece invades to the south of the CESA forces,
       basically cooperating with them against Turkey; Grim jokes about
       "carving up Turkey" spread throughout the English-speaking world

      *DMTP II is quietly moved into the control of the LSN Exploration
       Service, which is under the LSN's Ministry of Communication, though
       with extensive Defense Ministry consultation

      *Japanese Inland Sea reclamation continues apace, despite protests;
       Experts estimate the project will be complete by 2228;  Reclaimed land
       is increasingly called New Sea Land, or Shin Umiji;  Most of the Shin
       Umiji is now populated

      *DMTP II continues apace, though being limited in scope;  LSN
       representatives continue trying to gain access to other Spheres,
       partially through Human Space Defense Alliance channels
