Proposed message to the place where we took out the permit: We have 
destroyed several creatures of Dark infesting this area.  The monastery itself 
appears to have been looted, but the wards set on the place seem to be in 
partial working order.  One of us has decided to see if he can repair the 
damage and bring them up into full working order.  This would keep it from 
becoming reinfested.  Inquiries regarding use the Monastery space in the 
future should be directed to Mailbox xxx (wherever we get our mail at the 
mage guild).  Alex, is the Monastery right up against "The Wall"?  If 
not, what is between the Monastery and the barrier?

Morphus (To CB)(Thread 2)
Can you use your contacts to get a message to the head of the rainbow 
robe (Alex: what is the official name of this group anyway?) group?  Tell 
him/her that a group of mages took out a permit to go hunting in the 
Sevestan Monastery Area and managed to clear out the whole monastery.  A 
member of this group would like to discuss the disposition of the Monastery 
and it's contents, including the bodies of members of your order.  For 
reasons which cannot be discussed, this meeting must be kept secret, even 
though the actual transaction will be relatively public.  I will provide 
recognition signals to include in the message indicating that a member of high 
rank is the source of the message if I can get this info from Alex (he 
already has my rolls and a copy of this is going to him.

Jim (Thread 2)
Chris,
   I would recommend that you wait on sending a letter to the 
monastery until Mordanith can do a foreseeing on the effect it will have on 
the rainbow alliance. Also, be warned,that Mordanith will be asking you 
some hard questions about what happened at the monastery. It seems to me 
(jim), from talking with Alex, that you made a calculated gamble with just 
Mordanith's life. If that was the case, and Morphus knew that was the case, then 
there is no problem. It will only mean that Mordanith will trust you less. 
As it stands now though, Mordanith will ask those questions since he 
doesn't know what Jim knows.
Catbird(To Morphus)(Thread 2)
Morphus. I am going to set this up and *distance* us from the deal.	I 
am going to handle the set up my way. Your way is brute force. "You 
will do what I want _or_else_"  
I think he will be a bit more willing if he doesn't know who you are. 
If he doesn't feel coerced. In fact, if he (or she) knows who you are 
and feels as Tev did, then they're not coming for love or money. 
Morphus, do you get it? You are not popular here. There's no getting around 
it: Kheldar was an asshole. Morphus is not (yet?) Kheldar. You would be 
well served to ask yourself: "How would K handle this?" and then do the 
exact opposite.

I am going to a great deal of trouble to make this work and avoid 
getting these folk hurt. Understand that. Do not *use* them. They gave me a 
place when I had none and died horribly. Let us both protect our interests 
*and* theirs.

I'll let you know what I can arrange. Before I proceed, I must have 
your word that you will do this *and* abide by whatever rules apply to 
the place of meeting (as per the guild.) Do you agree and give your word 
on this?	

Chris: Please avoid giving CB any suspicion that the massacre 
happened because of you. Things will be nicer all around that way. This is 
just to say that I don't know how to play-ability-wise handle her 
reaction to such an idea. Best to avoid it. In case I didn't explicitly say 
so, I pass on the inf. about Miriel visiting me at the monastery...		S

Chris and Alex
C:How long ago did I install the wards in the monastery?  And how 
long ago did the massacre there take place?  I think that you said 10 
years and 13 years respectively, but I wanted to make sure - real sure.

A:Installation of Wards: 13 years

A:Massacre: 10 years

A:Sorry if this is disappointing to you, or your welcome if this is 
what you wanted.  

Morphus (To Mordanith)(Thread 2)
Morphus will tell Mordanith (immediately after the dark is killed) 
that in the moment when the Wards came on line he was notified that there 
were "designated hostiles within the boundaries, do you wish to activate 
countermeasures?"  NO number of hostels was given and because the Dark was 
infiltrating the  now activated Wards, I was afraid that it would take control of 
the defenses of the Monastery.    I thought that I only had a split 
second and in that time I tried to find out if you were considered a 
hostile.  I wasn't able to determine whether you were or not and somehow I 
just never considered Catbird and Golden throat as possible targets (or 
myself for that matter).  I assumed (possibly erroneously) that anyone 
bringing up the wards was a good guy - even if it was a Lethar - so by that 
reasoning I wasn't in danger.  I thought that Catbird and Golden throat were 
not mages and therefore not in danger - they ended up not being in 
danger, but not necessarily for that reason (I  don't know what the criteria 
of the Wards is - humans who aren't Dissenta are OK?  or are Dissenta 
OK too?)  The biggest doubt that I had was you - you were a mage and an 
Elf - which Kheldar apparently considered hostiles in the past.  All 
this happened in a second and I took the chance hoping that I could 
control what was going to happen.  Immediately afterwards (too late) I 
established mental contact with you to attempt to isolate you enough to inform 
the wards that you were not ahostile.  Morphus considered his actions to 
be a calculated gamble with all of our lives - yours in particular 
because you are an elf. Chris does Morphus's thinking and does the best that 
he can.  Sometimes he  may do something that Morphus (as he is played) 
might not do, but all humans(even elves) - characters or players - make 
judgment calls.  Sometimes these turn out OK and sometimes not. There is one 
thing that Mordanith (and not Jim) should consider about morphus (and 
Kheldar).Kheldar was not Pro-Elf.  He seems to have been at best indifferent, as long 
as they didn't interfere with what he was doing.  Since Kheldar has 
been Morphus, and since Morphus has known Mordanith, this feeling has 
changed. Morphus may not have many (if any) supporters among the elves, but 
he does value the race's existence and the opinion of one Elf in 
particular - even if they do disagree quite a lot. By all means do a foreseeing 
and let me know what you find out.

Jim(Thread 1)
Chris, Are you seriously suggesting that you give them our MageGuild 
address as a way of contacting us ? Why not just hang a sign on your neck 
that says "I'm Kheldar, Kick Me !" :-) Any fairly good non-mage snoop 
could probably track us down from that kind of link. I would suggest 
(assuming that Mordanith's) foreseeing doesn't indicate a problem) that you 
simply give them the message and details on how to operate the monastery 
wards and let them go from there. After all they really don't need to see 
you in order to do their work on the monastery do they ? 

 Chris(Thread 1) 
That proposed message was to the people who we got the permit from, 
not the rainbow folks.  This message was to notify the mage guild that 
we were done hunting, that we killed some dark, that we found nothing 
and that one of us was going to "restore the house" for possible resale 
(I'm thinking of doing the work a little at a time on stops at Marden).  
All inquiries welcome, etc.  When we registered for our permit we told 
them our names.  I'm sure that is not classified info.

Jim(Thread 1)
Chris,   You might want to hold off on the info to the guild. Simply 
build up the defenses as much as you can. Then, if all is copacetic with 
the foreseeing and the Rainbow Alliance agrees, have them approach the 
mage council or guild to act as intermediaries between themsicate a
