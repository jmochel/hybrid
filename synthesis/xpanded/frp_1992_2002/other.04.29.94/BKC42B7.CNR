Oh.  One other comment.  I see one method of magic that results from
attributes (however their form) is on one hand simple conceptually and
hard in practice (potentially).  For me a simple way to treat magic
is in the MANIPULATION of attribute points from one form to another.

If every object in the game universe (gameverse) has the same list
of attributes, magic is the ability to CONVERT or otherwise manipulate
the attributes as desired. EX:

EX:

A mage with high MIND STRENGTH, knowledge about strength, combined with
high MIND & BODY INTELLIGENCE is able to convert the BODY strength values
found in a nearby TREE or ROCK into BODY values of a nearby FIGHTER to
enhance the FIGHTERS strength.

	GABALAIN stood calmly as the ORGE attacked Little Joe.  A streak
	of lightning lashed out from a large boulder.  For a brief moment
	a brilliant blue flame surged from the rock to Gabalain and
	then surrounded Joe.  With a loud CRACK!, the boulder was reduced
	to dust.  Little Joe, with renewed vigor (and sensing defeat)
	stepped back to muster a mighty swing.  The ORGE, blinded briefly,
	only smiled at the comming attempt from this puny human.  But
	the smile was converted to a twisted scowl of pain and confusion
	when Joe's sword penatrated his mail, striking his heart!
