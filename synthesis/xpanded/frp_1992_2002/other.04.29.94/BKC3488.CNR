On testing systems without annoying players:

Give them a copy beforehand and let them trash it.  A good player can spot
problems just by reading the rules.  After that, hold the "melee" night,
where everyone can design a character from the same base, and you then
have a no-roleplaying bar brawl/firefight to test out the rules.  The
same can be applied to other rules sections, ala social interaction, magic,
etc.
