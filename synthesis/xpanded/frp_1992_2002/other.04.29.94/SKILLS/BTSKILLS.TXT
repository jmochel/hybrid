Hmmm.... I haven't forgotten secondaries.  

I do think that I would rather have General skills be rare- I don't want
people to have a plethora of them...

Effectively what doubling the ep cost does is subtract 40 from the ep role.... 
maybe I should just have it ep normally but subtract 30 or 20....

Subject: DES: BT Skills and Panic


*AHEM!*

To clear up a misunderstanding first- let me clear up three points....


(1) I made a mistake- as has strongly been pointed out to me the 
    double cost rule is not YET in effect.  So General skills are
    still costing 1 for 1, and it won't change until rev 5, whenever that
    will be.

(2)  James makes his point well, albeit rudely.  I am forced to 
     reconsider the double cost for Geenral skills.  More on that below.

(3) People should not panic during these discussions.   Most of you have
    a much better grasp of BT than you might think.  WHen we are going back
    and forth, sometimes mistakes happen and somethimes we are brainstorming.
    Sometimes I make mistakes....  I have found that people are doing pretty 
    well at calculating accurate chances in BT.  SO don't worry.

Hmm.. yes it is in a sesne repeating of three above.  I wanted to highlight 
though how useful that is.

> (5) It adds to the Level Factor like any other skill

>>	No, it doesn't.  That's the problem.

Umm.. yes it does.  Whatdo you mean by this - rank for rank it does.  It won't
roll for roll if it is double.

One thing that you seem to be consistently forgetting is that you can only use 
two secondaries.   The other thing is the purpose of the general skill- it is 
to support a series of skills.  It is not to compete against primaries.  I
am not being evasive here.  A general skill is intended as a support skill of
a set of skills.  If you have a 10 in Long Sword, an 8 in Short sword and an 8 
in 2-handed sword, having a General skill in sword becomes worth it because
it is the cheapeast way to get higher to-hits AND you get SPD and DAM bonuses!

>>general skill is KO'ed by the loss of 30 factor.  In terms of skill
>>chance, the generalist is better at NOTHING, 100% worse at 6 skills
>>and 30% worse at the hundreds of skills in the factor outside of the
>>three areas.

Well.. ain't that a hoot- you are quite right there...IN TERMS OF RAW CHANCE,
and when the perosn doesn't already have secondaries- remember you can only 
use two...

GEN: 8  =  +24%(GEN) + 6%(LVF) = +30%
PRIM: 8,8 = +48%(SECondaries) + 12(LVF) = +60%

Definitley superior there... (in to-hit- I am igmnoring the familiarity, SPD 
and DAM bonuses- all of which give the edge to General skills)

GEN: 7	= +21% + 4% = 25%
PR: 7,7 = +42% + 8% = 50%

6	= +18% + 3% = 21%
6,6	= +36% + 6% = 42%

It will be double the bonus to buy two secondaries rather than a general skill 
- UNLESS the character already has two strong secondaries!  This all just might 
mean that you don't take a genral skill unless it is a field you will be doing 
a lot in!;-)  I have no objection to that!;-)

Yes- your math is good- a general skill make syou better in a specific area 
at a cost everywhere else.  Not necessarily a problem.

That actuially isn't true as you yourself demonstrated- be careful with 
statements like "pretty much wipes out.."  The fact is you get more SPD,
MORE DAM, and, if you already had secondaries, more to-hits.  The factis
it is a posuitive effect in that domain under the umbrella of the genreal skill.
That is not to say that it might not be over-all more valuable to not use 
them but let us keep it straight.  If I were a specialist swordsman with four 
skills sword skills I would take the General skill at double cost.

Incorrect Franzlar!  That is rev3: Unfamiliarity has been -30.  It used to be 
(over two years ago) -10 and 4/5 of the related skill but that is no longer true.
The specialist also gets the SPD and DAM mods with those guns!!!

I may not double the cost.  But I may- I am not sure yet.  I am amazed though 
by the to-hit effect created by secondaries and am impressed by that!  It will 
make me re-think.
