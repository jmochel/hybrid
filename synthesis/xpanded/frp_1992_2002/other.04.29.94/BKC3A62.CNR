    Actually constitution is a pretty good stat to deal with because it
covers so many different aspects of physical makeup. Con is just too
general a term if you want to deal with this level of detail. Possibly what
needs to be done is a breakdonw of stats like con into slighly more
specific categories, and give each of them its own score, and then you can
see how the overall con of something could be the same value, but have a
completely different composition depending on the con categories.

    Well, I suppose that you could give the javelin an appropriate rating
if used like a club, but that is about the only way around this situation.
Maybe what you could do is give a damage rating for each type of use of a
weapon: slash, stab, crush, and then use the appropriate damage class for
the current use of the weapon. If you wanted to get crazy about it you
could rate each of the weapons attributes based on each of the three damage
types, and then use that set of stats for the appropriate situation.
