Paul sez he wants a game you can explain in a few minutes.  Alex is
right, that's quite a pipe dream.  But a noble one.  :-)

Me, I'll settle for a game that is CLEARLY EXPLAINED.  Even the most
complicated game can be learned quickly if the rules are clear and anticipate
the reader's questions.  It never ceases to amaze me that the editors and
writers of most games on the market ever got their stuff past the first
galley proof.  Any writer knows, the foremost part of writing is clarity.
Without it you can have the neatest, most brillaint, realistic, exciting
game on the market and it won't be worth anything.

On the other hand, clarity isn't often easy to acheive.  I think part of
the problem is that people tend to confuse clarity with detail of explanation
-- which is not neccessarily true.  For instance, a lot of new games include
large sections on "What is a RPG" etc. -- which is nice -- but for clarity's
sake, perhaps not -- because the average reader of RPG's already knows
what they are -- and a lot are like you and I, with lot's of experience,
and hate wading thru all that introductory crap.

IMHO, the best way to learn rules is to do.  In that sense, game designers
ought to create a "basic" version of their game that *can* be learned in
a few minutes.  Take a clue from the editors of the basic adnd rules -- whose
introduction is the best I have seen yet.  The "rules" are actually a
solo adventure that quickly introduces the basic concepts, THAC0, damage,
HitPoints, etc. -- and more importantly, how they work in the game.

Well, us designers have our work cut out for us, I guess.  Good luck...
