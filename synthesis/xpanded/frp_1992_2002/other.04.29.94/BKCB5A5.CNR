Elements of the "Perfect" RPG System                 Just One Person's Opinion
==============================================================================

Everyone has his or her own idea of what the "perfect" role-playing game is,
and doubtless very few people agree.  Here's what I look for.


1. Basis

Everything should be broken down to the most simple level.  Avoid grouping
several similar attributes under one larger heading.  Break them down to a
basis level.

2. Unification

Statistics should apply equally to player characters, non-player characters,
monsters, vehicles, and so on.  Create universal scales for attributes, and put
the PCs on those scales.

3. Skill-based

Avoid the concept of classes, or archetypes.  Allow players to create
characters through the choice of skills and knowledge.  All of the other game
systems should tie into the skill system (combat and magic should be
skill-based).

4. Modularity

The individual systems within the RPG should be modular.  That is, they should
all tie together, but it should be possible to remove or replace an entire
system without forcing the modification of the other systems.  For example, one
could replace a FRPG's magic system very easily.

5. Scalability

Anything that can be scaled per the tastes of the game master and the players
should be made scalable.  The GM should have control over rates of advancement,
level of detail, speed of combat, rate of play, and so on.  The rules should
supply a fundamental level of detail, and offer Scalability rules (not exactly
"Optional," but rules that can be applied for more detail in certain
situations).

6. Efficiency

The game should attain a desired measure of "realism" (verisimilitude?) without
paying too high a cost in playability.  If possible, allow the GM and players
to choose a point along the scale between high realism/low playability and low
realism/high playability, within certain limits set by the designer.  As much
as possible, the game should attain as much realism and playability as
possible; this is efficiency.

7. Clarity

The rules should be clear at all points.  Examples are helpful.  A list of
compiled charts is useful.  An experienced gamer should be able to learn the
game at one sitting.
