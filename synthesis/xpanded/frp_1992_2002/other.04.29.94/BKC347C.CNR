Subject:      re: game design -- having an arbitrator
To: Multiple recipients of list GMAST-L <GMAST-L@UTCVM>

At first glance this seems to be a pretty good idea -- but then again,
not.  An arbitrator would ruin the whole concept of a group-design; i.e. he
or she would have the final say.  I don't think I could work in a group
in which there was an "arbitrator".

On the other hand, net-votes simply do not work.  That was tried, and failed,
in the UD project.  They are too time consuming.  I think that a variation
of the net-votes is the way to go.  After some time kibitizing around to
set down some guidelines (basic concepts, etc) for the game, we should
each work on a module -- keeping the rest appraised of out endeavors.  If
other members wish to comment on someone elses ongoing work, they can --
using the GUIDELINES as the final arbiter of disputes.
