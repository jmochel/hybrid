[Rolemaster being slow]

     From my experience with SpaceMaster (shares the same system as
RoleMaster I'm told), there are too problems with the system that cause it to
be slow.  Neither problem is the number of attributes (or the
current/potential values of each attribute).  The first problem is there is
FAR too much chart-looking up.  Each time you go to a chart (2-3 times per
action in combat!) play stops for a few seconds.

     The second problem is there are far too many skills for it's own good.
It takes hours to decide what skills you want your character to have (and all
the bizzare interactions including specializing vs generalist and similar
skill bonuses).

     Overall, I like the system for it's realism, but I wish something could
be done to make it a bit zippier.

[hero points...]

     I know of two systems that do 'hero points'.  Top Secret (TSR) has luck
points which you can use to change what just happened.  Torg (WEG) has
possibility points which let you add to your roll or remove damage (it looked
worse than it was...).  Both systems give you more points for good play and
successful adventures sort of like xp.

[Clerical "spells"]

     Ah, yes, another of my pet peeves:  clerical "magic".  Clerics shouldn't
get defined spells in my opinion.  Clerics should just pray and depending on
his piety (faith?) his diety may grant the request (or some mutated form of
it).  I always thought that if the diety (GM) knew that the cleric's request
was wrong/pointless why would S/He grant it??  The following is sort of what
I've always wanted to see from a system (off the cuff; not necessarily well
thought-out):

     Clerics should have a faith skill/score/attribute and whenever they want
the intervention of their diety, they roll against it (a successful prayer).
The exact effect should be a mix between what the character states he wants
in the prayer, how effectively he prayed; and how the GM (diety) feels about
the request.

     The faith skill could be modified negatively for each request (you've
been asking for too many favors) or for actions by the cleric that are
definitely against his diety (the druid carves his initials in a tree --
actually happened in a game I was running).  The faith skills could be
positively affected by actions viewed as being in adherance with the tenants
of the faith (the priest donates all but 1 gp to the poor in keeping with his
vow of poverty).

     It would work like this:  the cleric sees his friend lying near death
from grevous wounds.  He prays:  "Please Mighty SO-AND-SO, hear the request
of your servant.  This noble soul lying near death has ever been a freind to
the Faith.  Please send your agents to watch over his recovery and carry him
savely from the Gates of the Nether world." or some such.  The roll is
successful (a good prayer) and the diety, knowing that his faithful servant
will soon be in need of this friend cures some-number-N wounds.  The clerics
faith score is lowerd by an appropriate amount (in proportion to the number
N).

     This also fixes the flaw I've seen where the cleric cures a party member
who's been opennly hostile to the cleric's religion (I know, the cleric
player is wrong for trying to cure the heathen; but I've seen it done).
Wouldn't the diety say "Not on your Nellie!"?
