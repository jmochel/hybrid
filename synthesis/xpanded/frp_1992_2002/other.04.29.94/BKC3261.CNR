    This concept makes a lot of sense. I too feel that simplicity is
important aspect to systems. (Please not: it is possible to have simple
breakdowns and still have an involved and complex system)

> 2. Unification


    This is another important concept. I also think that it is important
not to have too many different scales, but havin only 1 is very limiting to
the system. Basically I think that it is a bad idea to base everything on
the 1-100 scale and then attemtpt to fit everything to that scale.

> 3. Skill-based

    I'm not so sure about this one. I definatly agree that combat should be
skill based; as long as characters put the time into it then they should be
able to get as good as they can. As for magic, I personally love
skill-based magic systems. The big question for me is whether or it is a
spell point system or not. I can't stand spell point systems.
    On skill-based vs. class-based there is nothing wrong with generic
classifications of profession or main skill areas, for starting characters.
Please note that this is something that should only be used for charcters
at the time of creation, to give them some kind of start off point. After
that the charcter should be able t advance and devlop in anyway s/he sees
fit. One thing that I feel should be left out of every system is the
concept of character levels. The character doesn't improve, the character's
skills and attributes improve.


> 4. Modularity

    About the only thing I have to say about modularity, really pertains to
(high) fantasy systems. When dealing with gods and religion, it is very
important to tailor this part of the system to the world. This makes it
very difficult to easily transport this part of the system, but if you have
rules set for spell/power aquisition it would be possible to have a number
of different worlds each with their own religion (Yeah, right... ;-)


> 5. Scalability

    The problem with your definition of scalability, as I see it, is that
it leads to only have a limited number of statistical ranges that would
make global scaling of different parts of the system possible to impliment.

> 6. Efficiency

    Who is desiring the realism in the system? There is no reason that a
system has to have any level of realism in it whatsoever. It should be the
decision of the game designer to put realism into a system and to decide
how much s/he wants. The level of realism has very little to do with the
efficieny of the game itself. It is just the level of realism. If it is
impliment effeciently then it is efficient.

> 7. Clarity

    Certainly no argument here. I would like to say that an experienced
gamer should be able to learn at least the basics in one sitting. For more
compex game systems it might take a couple of sessions to really come
across the majority of the nuances.
