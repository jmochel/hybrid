Hi there folks,
   
As a result of a talk with Pooky I am seriously considering adding 
user definable pools of skills to SH. A user definable pool is 
similar in concept to BTs factors except they would be defined by the 
player. As an example, some of a theif's skills could be collected 
together into a pool that would add to the chance to do any skill 
in that pool. 

There could be more than one pool per character , or a character 
could have none. The pools could be based on the way the skills were 
learned or on the type of skills (melee combat vs missile combat )
they were.

Here is my dilemma.

There is no evidence to indicate that such a diffuse feedback 
between skills actually exists. There is even some evidence that 
it does not. But there is also an automatic belief that such a
feedback exists. So even though it is unlikely that the feedback 
model does model reality, it models the perceived reality. 

There would obviously have to be something to relate the ranks and 
numbers of the skills. But BT has already demonstrated that the 
feedback model can be made to work, in terms of math. My question is 
: Is it worth it.

I am convinced that it can be made to work. I am just not sure that 
anyone wants it.

Any feedback, ideas, flames ?
