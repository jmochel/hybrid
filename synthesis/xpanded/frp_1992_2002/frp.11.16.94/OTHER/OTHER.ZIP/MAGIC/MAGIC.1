Here's an idea I had for an alternate magic system; it's designed right now
for White Wolf's World of Darkness, 'cause that's the system I'm "into"
right now, but could easily be converted into any system.

The premise here was to make a mgic system loosely based on the functioning
of FTP and Unix. No, this is not a joke, and it's a serious magic system.
It also rounds out my growing collection of alternate magic systems for
WOD.

However, this system is still in development, and I'd like feedback and
suggestions from people who know more about computers than I, and can
expand the metaphors some.

The most basic concept in this system is that of options. Options are
"spells"; they are potential the universe stores, but does not use. Given
an infinite potential, anything can be done with Options; however, only the
more likely ones are easily accessable - thus, many of the spells will
resemble "coincidental" magic from WW's Mage game; that is, the more likely
that the event would have happened, the easier the Option is to access, ie:
it is more likely a chunk of mortar will fall from a bulding and hit your
oppenets head than it is a lighting bolt will shoot out of your hands -
however, both are Options.

The first part of using an Option is to access the field of Universal
potential. This is fairly simple, and can be turned on or off at will, as
the mage whims (from here on, mage and magic user will be replaced simply
with "User," to differntiate these spell-casters from Magi and Shamans.)
The field never "crashes," but may become inaccessable at times.

Once the mage has accessed the field, he views all the potentials that are
available to him - this should be small number, as only important things to
him will be accessable first (and remember, this is the Universe's (ie STs)
judgement as to what is important,)

If the Option he wants is not available, he can Go deeper into the field to
find it. Everything exists in the potential of the field, but some options
are burried deeper. In general, the less likely and less important an
Option is, the deeper it will be in the field. Users may sometimes have to
Go very deep to find the Option they want.

Once the User finds the Option, he must Get it. Users have a maximum number
of Options they may have Gotten at one time. Users with more ability may
Get more than one Option at once: Mget.

The Option remains with the User until the situation that the Option
effects changes - then the User looses the option. For example, if a User
Got an Option to open a door, but the door opened before he used it, he
would loose the Option.

Users may make a Gotten Option permanent by Converting it. A Converted
option will stay but be unuasable until Unconverted. Options may or may not
affect things they weren't originally meant for : thus, the Otion to open
the door, when Unconverted two days later, may or may not open another
door. The relation seems to depend upon the metaphorical relationship
between the things.

Options may also be placed into other things, or Put there. They may also
be Mput. Here, they do not use any of the mages slots, but still must be
Gotten before they can be used, and possibly Unconverted.

Options may also be Mcast, but only if placed beforehand into a mystical
"folder"


Summery:
I: Access Option field
	a: Go deeper into field
II: Get Option
	a: Mget
	b: Convert/ Unconvert
	c: Put/ Mput
III: Cast Option
	a: Mcast
		1: must be placed in folder

A brief guide for use in WOD:
	Field access may or may not be an advantage, depending on whether the
character is designed _as_ a User, or as another beign that can access.
	The abilities for using this kind of magic are:
	Go
	Get
	Put
	Convert
	Cast

	Each costs 2 freebies per level to buy. Each ranges from 1-5. Higher
levels in Go = quicker accessing; Get = that many fiels can be Mgotten,
same for put and cast; higher levels of Convert mean a more complicated
Conversion = harder to be broken by other mages.

	This system uses few rolls for casting options: there are no rolls to Get,
Put, Convert, or Cast. Rolls may be required for Go (depending on how the
ST rules it), and are always required for Unconverting another mages spell.

	Going deeper into the field takes one turn. The ST may predecide at what
level the effect is the User wants, and he may go in deeper = his level in
Go per turn, or he may set a target number.

	Getting or Mgetting a number of options = Mget level takes a turn.

	Putting """"
	Converting. Deconverting takes a turn (per roll).

	Casting takes a turn. Placing options into a folder (max #=Mcast) takes a
turn.

	The most Options a User can have at one time = his willpower rating.
