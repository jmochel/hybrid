            Magic as such travels through the female lines. The various sorceries, called
            <b>astatis<b>, are openly discussed as gifts or skills such as "Horse Healing"
            or "Fire Starting" and are undistinguished from the non-magical crafts of
            the same name.

        Hunting makes up a large part of the Rhizak diet as well a small amount of
        collected rootstocks and grains. Large fish (akin to Salmon) are caught and
        smoked each season in the foothills of the northen range.

    <kinship>
        <p>
        A matrilineal culture, the Rhizak establish heredity via the female line.
        So a child might be mentioned as being Junjen's first son in Toth's(f) line.
        Otherwise kinship is assumed to travel through the male's female relatives.

            Shamans are assumed to talk more directly to the ancestors
            than a normal tribesman. And better at fending off vengeful
            spirits.
