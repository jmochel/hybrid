Hi guys,
	Here is my first cut at a ritual design for the heartstone.  Tell me what you think.  Also, if there are any "character elements" you can add like scripts or visual aids for your character send the along.  Could someone forward this to lara since I don't have her correct e-mail address on me at home.

I suspect she will wind up with multiple copies, so am not sending one.  
(I suspect you will get multiple copies of her email address, but am 
sending it anyway.  Go figure.)

[Lara, if you don't have three copies by now, let me know and I'll zap 
you one.]



Ritual Reactions:

Oh my Gawd!

Are you sure?

Get outta here!



Reactions to Ritual:

Well, to begin with, several people are listed as People in the ritual, 
things in the ritual, and (most confusingly) as people to be specifically 
excluded from the ritual.  Could you perhaps clarify this a little?


Also I am assuming Alex agrees with your description of the heartstone.  
(The symbol representing the agreement that there is a consensus... 
sheesh!  I thought Catholocism was convoluted!)


Going back the the Creation Myth (no relation) Alex told us, I think 
Earth/Air/Fire/Water/Power is a much better five-element choice than 
Earth/Fire/Water/Light/Dark.  (There is also a slight personal bias, as 
E-man is a Master of Air, but barely competant in any of the others.)  If 
we were to go to a seven-element plan, I'd recommend Light and Dark then, 
but we'd need more casters, and the troupe is already getting unwieldy.

Note on that Creation Myth (no relation)-- we probably want to mimic that 
when we introduce the elements; it is a powerful resonance and will give 
the ritual an impressive grounding in history, as well as increasing its 
position as 'the way things already are.'  Does someone have an 
easily-accessible copy, or should I try and de-archive mine?


I think the current design may have too stong a dependance on 'Five'.  
While a certain amount of reinforcement is good, and Five is certainly a 
significant number, allowing other elements of the ritual to be distorted 
to maintain the fiveness is not necessarily a good thing.  (Besides, it 
might render the ward vulnerable to a certain other "Five", which I would 
count as a Bad Thing.)

I like the five casters (a selection somewhat already made for us) and 
the five elements (the creation resonance is very valuable to a work of 
this nature).  I am less certain of the five support-casters (as you 
noted, they are somewhat shoehorned into spots), the five dimensions (are 
they a complete set?  Alex?), and the five phases (it seems a little long 
and complex for us to handle, when dealing with powers of this magnitude, 
but maybe that's just me).

Five casters: Sigmund, Morphus, Mordenaith, Erithmaeon, Kilsorana
Five anchors: Haalite objects
Five Fortu:   DJan, Darius, Peter, Pentos, Trevaine

Hm.  Given that we have to set up some sort of safety zone (for the 
carpet bag and other wonders), we might want to set up a ring outside the 
ward for defenders.  That would let Arak and Trevaine (hm.. we need a 
third; three is a good number.  Ahmoud?) handle outside threats without 
disturbing the ritual, and leave an in-ritual spot for Drellan.

I would suggect:

Three Phases: Patterning, Substance, Empowerment

Purification would be part of Patterning, Substance would invoke the 
elements in classic Creation order, and Empowerment would set the whole 
thing into motion.

This would necessitate altering the caster-pattern as well. [Boy, does a 
Dorian education come in handy during these discussions!]

Phase 1: Patterning 
 
  A. Primary casters meditate, cleansing their souls (or just sitting and 
humming)
     Secondary casters purify area

  B. Form primary-seconday pairs, using Fortu 'be one with' skill.
     Establish ward zone and safe zone, including non-participating 
artifact storage.

  C. Establish patterns for matter/energy/ward
     Primary element of caster inside proto-ward, secondary element 
outside.
     Each primary-secondary linked to 'their' anchor
     Each primary linked to every other primary
     Each primary-secondary with one non-sapient artifact.

Phase 2: Substance

  A. Each caster calls upon their representative element, in Creation 
Myth order.

  B. Element flows are guided along pattern-lines
     Each element has connections to primary anchor (summoner's) and all 
other anchors

  C. Elements blend and transubstantiate
     Flow pattern becomes one five-fold stream, with five elemental 
resonances.

Phase 3: Empowerment

  A. Elemental power is refined into ward structures, one step away from 
Reality.
     (Note: Reality provided for comparison purposes only.  Your mileage 
may vary.)

  B. Trigger-point is set
     One final element, to bring the ward to realization, is built and 
spell-triggered

  C. Primaries retreat to join secondaries
     Anchors stay at the borders
     Without primary-secondary bond crossing its lines, proto-ward 
pattern completes
     Spell-trigger goes off, proto-ward becomes real ward.


Not quite as elegantly-written as Docto.. er, Jim's, and lacking a number 
of details, but I think a more effective cast, given the limitations of 
the group.

I particularly like the progression of casters. Phase one has ten 
individuals joining to five casters.  Phase two has five casters acting 
in parallel, a kind of seperate but equal thing.  Phase three has five 
casters acting as one.



Whew!

Well, those are my thoughts, at least at the moment.

So, Morphus tries to contact Mordanith and says, "Mordanith, what can you

I'm finishing negotiating a new job and won't be able to respond

I thought that it was the symbol of the consensus, ie. in Sci-Fi terms, a
holographic matrix of everything.

I strongly agree.  However, one thing that we all MUST discuss before we go
too far with this is what each of our characters believes is the Creation
Myth.  Morphus has two creation stories in his head (so far, <grimace>).
One is that in the beginning there were five Wills which (to make a long
story short) represent Earth, Fire, Water, Light, and Dark.  In this
reality, Air IS made of Light and Dark.  Nature and Life are made with
Light as a base and maybe (chris doesn't know, morphus might) Earth, Water,
Fire and/or Air.  Death is made with Dark as a base with the same caveats.
Decay either does or does not exist (it did once, but I think Alex may have
rethought its addition).

The other involves a primal will, the Uncreated and Unseen, from which the
Five were created.

I have a full copy of the story as I received it.  I will send it to anyone
who is interested, but I suggest that you get "your version" from Alex.

Please understand that considering what we are going to be doing, and the
fact that we will not be doing anything else with reality while doing it
(Pook and Alex talked me out of some rather complex stuff that would have
had a side effect of eliminating the Linking Ward), it won't just be
Morphus letting us into the Heartstone chamber.  The other three surviving
creators of the Ward will be approving the procedure that will be carried
out prior to the ritual being cast.

>  C. Primaries retreat to join secondaries

Ring your partners, round and round.   Doe-see-doe and prominade.
Sorry.  My first look at this looks good Myth.  I'll give better comments

1. I was not aware of this.

2. If anything, this make my point even more valid, at least to me.  The 
Five (in their various combinations) have proven to be very clever, 
aggressive risk-takers (at least in others' eyes), and quite able to work 
their way around restrictions that they don't agree with.  In the 
interest of removing temptation, I would prefer to keep things as simple 
and secure as possible.  I am sorry for anyone who hasn't yet had a 
chance to remodel Reality to their liking yet, but one must draw the line 
somewhere.

OK Ritual people....

   I liked the write up but I agree with Myth that we have to look at the
dynamics of the elements.  If they are as they should be great.  I think that
we should stick with the pattern of five and I like the Fortu assignment as it
has been laid out.  Even more security would not bug me.  I could offer Wei-
Lee and Amud as physical guards outside of the ritual if we think that may be
necessary.

   I will craft my portion according to the instructions laid out by Sigmund.
I have no additonal input at this time but we should be clear about a
contingency plan if we are 1)interrupted   2)need to leave it in the middle
somewhere....

Can fortu hold a pattern for a period of time if necessary?

Peter and I could hold it for a while... I think.  It would be neither

What do you mean when you talk about the "four Haalite Anchors"?


Are you talking about the four dodecahedrons that are tuned to
Rismaeon, Logos, Falstaff, and Kheldar?  If so, I had not thought of
these as anchors as much as Keys along with your Halite Rod.  
>>Yes this was what I was thinking of.  You are correct, I should refer to them as keys in the ritual.


How much of this description did Alex give you as downloaded from the
ward?
>>None,  I have a bunch of stuff but I was just making up what it looked like.

Who did you determine told you that EARTH, AIR, FIRE, WATER, POWER was
going to create a balanced ward and how did they say these elements had
to be combined/utilized to do so?  My original plan called for
utilizing 20 tuned dodecahedrons in groups of 5 in a dodecahedral
pattern around the Heartstone tied together with Chronomancy.  Please
elaborate on the differences from my ritual to yours.

>> I have been out of the country and unable to pursue the element question yet.  I completely forgot about the
twenty vertices.  This should be in the ritual,  I tried to incorporate chronomancy in the temporal dimension. If you
have some ideas about how to make it better mail me some text.


Balance is a word which implies a frame of reference.   In the frame of
reference that I am using, Earth, Water, Fire, Light and Dark are equal
powers and balanced.  Are you casting a ward which has strength only
within the Vortex (the stuff within the Ward of Light), which has
strength within the Ward of Air (all of reality between the Earth and
the Void), or which has strength within the entire reality structure?

>> Within the entire reality structure of course.  I am flexible any way you want. You get everyone to agree
and I will ask alex about my source.

What are your skills in W:Earth?  Does it make sense for you to be
casting Earth Magics?

>> Earth magics are my strongest magery (after will stuff and abjuration I suppose). I am a rank 7 Geomancer as 
well as having rank 3 in D:Earth.  The other elements which I would be good at are Power (if we use that) in which I
am rank 8 or 9  or Dark if we use that (In which I am only rank 2 or 3.


What is "power"?

>> According to Alex In the Earth, Air , Fire, Water, Power element theory power is the raw material from which the 
other elements are shaped by the primal wills (this may have been butchered).  This is still a matter of sources.
 
I don't agree that space and time should be seperate.  Space and time
are merely two descriptors for dimensional terms, as is planar phase,
which you left out.
>> This sounds like a reasonable point.  Perhaps we can combine this with the de-emphasis of 5 which Myth
was suggesting and combine space, time and planarity into a single role of dimensionality.

<fontfamily><param>Times</param><bigger>>the caster in this role will
maintain the conversation that the symbolic warding of the object which

</bigger></fontfamily>Huh?

>> This is my attempt to address in some language the idea that the thing which we are operating on is
a symbol and not an object.  As with any symbol, however, it has a symbolic nature and a manifestation.
Somehow we need to include the notion that we are isolating the symbol of the consensus and not just 
the current manifestation (container?) of that symbol.

I'm a little concerned about your assistants.  You have a lot of Fortu
in the room.  That makes me nervous in view of the recent changes and
the fact that the Fortu aren't all bound to individuals (other tha
other Fortu).  If anything, Trevain, who is entirely non-magical (or
was before this) should remain out of the Heartstone room, guarding. 
D'Jan should also be outside.  No Divine elements can enter this area. 
He would be most effective in the doorway itself.  Darius - He was
tainted.  Are you sure that he is not in this reality?  You also need
to find out what Falstaff, Logos and Rismaeon are going to be doing. 
If I don't eliminate the Ward at the same time as we do this, they
*must* be dealt with.  Don't forget, they OWN the access to the
Heartstone, Fortu don't. (or didn't)

>>Now I am confused?  Many people have suggested that Trevaine is 
unnecessary in the ritual.  We should move him to act as security on the 
periphery.  What do you mean that no divine elements can enter this area?
Is this a physical impossibility?  Will Mordenaith be able to enter at all?
If there is no possibility of divine presence what is the basis for this?
When was Darius tainted?  What do you mean am I sure he is not in this 
reality.  Also, we definitely need to deal with the other four and the ward
both of which we were already incoporating in the ritual. 


Please be aware that we don't want to have too many entities in the
presence of the Heartstone.  The Heartstone helps to define the "space"
around itself.  I don't know what will happen when we make it go by-by.
 I wouldn't want to wait at the end of a line of entities trying to get
out of the door.

>> Noted, what do you think would be the ideal number?


My concept for this involves isolating the symbol of the consensus by
utilizing a balanced subset of the basic essence of Reality (not just
the Vortex) to squeeze the symbol outside of reality into the Void
(actually into its own pocket reality).  This will have the effect of
removing it from the minds of everyone in the current reality
(including the castors) except for the Five Wills (who don't move at
our level and the five entities that are Keyed to the Keys that Key the
door shut.  These five will have to retain knowledge so that we can
continue to repair the machine and return the symbol when it is
necessary.

>>  I agree completely that we need to produce a reality bubble which
is as fundamental to the nature of reality as possible.  I think we only
differ on implementation.  I am fine with building the ward out of whatever
stuff we can slap together,  I think we just need consensus on that. I 
do however think that the castors are much more likely to "remember"
the previous reality than most other entities.  I also hope that you are not
expecting one hundred percent coverage (although I think that the concept
behind the ritual makes enough sense so that most people who can save
will still back it).

Okay- I like it.  It is misisng however the work that Chris did- If you can incorporate that I think the combination of the two will be a very powerful ritual.

It is NOT a holographic matrix of everything- it is a symbol- not the thing
itself.It is a mirror that reflects back the consensus and thus keeps the world
in

Not quite.  Air was created first by the Destroyer and the Starchild
workingtogether.  Then the Destroyer created Leknud- a force
that moved through air to dominate air to the Destroyers will.  In response
the
Starchild created Thcil- a force that moves through Air to combat Leknud.
Leknud and Thcil are in a constant struggle for dominance.   They are Light
and Dark.  So although Light and Dark may represent the Two Wills that
created Air, Air is a major element and Light and Dark are not.

Decay was created by the Destroyer to combat Nature which the Starchildhad
created.  Both "evolved" into Life and Death with the prompting of the
Two Wills...  both are sourced in Earth, Nature is sourced in Earth and
Water and Light, Decay is sourced in Earth and Dark.

Closer to 130-150.

That is accurate- this won't stop it/  It will just make it a lot harder.  And it will disable the machine- even if
the machine were fixed.

Subject:	Re: Ritual

<fontfamily><param>Geneva</param>I'm sorry if I seem like I'm going
back and forth, but I have more information from Alex that has caused
me to go back to some of my original plans/concepts.  This message was
mainly directed towards Pookie, but I realized after I wrote it that it
would save time if everyone else read it too.


Regarding participants:

We MUST have more discussion on our creation myths and the element
baseline.  When I explained to Alex what the term "reality" encompassed
for me, he agreed with me that EARTH, FIRE, WATER, LIGHT, and DARK were
balanced in that concept.  Without further discussion we can't come to
agreement on the elements; without agreement on the elements, we can't
plan the procedures or who will carry them out.  Please lets discuss
this further.


I don't see a lot of elemental magic being cast during this process.  I
see using the elemental tuned nodes as the 20 vertices that I outlined
in our original discussions, but nothing more than that.  Willworking
and Abjuration (Shaping, Binding AND Warding) would play a much more
important role.


Although we (and I) won't be making any castings besides the isolation
ritual, and therefore Dora and the Hammer won't be required as I had
earlier suggested, I think that the 4 Dwarves are still a good idea. 
They would be much better anchors than the Halite.  I'd actually place
them within the boundary of the Ward construct while we build it.  They
would act as a stabilizer, utilizing Enforce Reality where necessary. 
I think that this is especially necessary since we will have two elves
participating in the ritual.  Also, entities within the Ward isolation
radius probably won't make it out.  And I am fairly certain that I know
just where to get 4 dwarves that would take that chance.


Regarding the Fortu participation:

I did not mean to imply that D'Jan was divine; only that since his
skills are in the divine area and divine magic can't be cast within the
boundaries, the portal between the restricted area and the outside
would seem to be the perfect place for him.


Peter, Drellan, Pentos:  I think that each of them should be involved.


D'Jan	I think that D'Jan should initially sweep the area but then take
station as I outlined above.  I think that he is best utilized just
handling the responsibility for detecting and limiting divine
interference in the ritual.


Trevaine	should not be involved with the ritual AT ALL.  He and Arak
would work with us IF we need to fight off the Battle-Ghosts (TM), but
then they should be posted outside to prevent interuption. The dwarves
would be better at providing a firm grounding in the reality integrity
of the casters.


Darius	If you are sure about Darius in terms of reliability, I agree
that I would like to have him assist.


Some changes from previous messages:

I had talked about people forgetting about the Heartstone as a result
of the ritual.  Also about the machine and the Linking Ward not
existing as a result of the ritual.  This would only be if we did a
Discipline III.  I discussed with Alex the consequences of such an
action.  Although Alex said that he could be prepared for it, Chris is
not (and therefore Morphus is not).


</fontfamily>My concept for the ritual still involves isolating the
symbol of the consensus by utilizing a balanced structure of the
components of Reality (not just the Vortex); squeezing the symbol
outside of Existence into a pocket reality 'blister' between Existence
and the Void. 


<fontfamily><param>Geneva</param>The Linking Ward would exist in any
case because Nuryev could have created it without creating the machine.
 The machine would not have existed and therefore nothing that we did
with the machine would have occured.  There have been a lot of things
done with the machine.  I (chris) was just not willing for the turmoil
that that would produce for us and our characters.  That brings us back
to Discipline II which says that it doesn't exist but it used to.  Thus
everything that was done will still have been done. 


With the Symbol not permanently out of reach and the machine on its way
to repair, as long as the Isolation Ward is Keyed as we discussed, I
don't see a problem with the rest of the creators of the Linking Ward.



Chris

Subject:	RE: Ritual

Well, it seems that E-man and I are WAY behind on our remedial cosmogeny. 
 Lacking specific knowledge of the Vortex, the Ward of Light, and all 
that ilk, I'm going to have to fall back on my more general knowledge of 
reality, and a feel for what makes good ritual. (Benefit of a Catholic 
upbringing.)

Here are my major requests for the ritual:

1) Not too complex.  The descriptions for this event seem to have every 
sign of running amok, burying us in minute detail and making us lose 
sight of the ultimate goal.  Besides, complicated things have loopholes.

2) No loopholes.  Alex has advised us that any spell distancing the 
Heartstone from the World will eventually decay.  I see no need to hurry 
the process, or risk it happening with catastrophic suddenness, rather 
than a natural slow rejoining.

3) Too many people/influences is bad, at least for the sort of thing we 
are doing.  A dozen people is pushing it, unfortunately including guards. 
 (A turb of grogs, anyone?)  I don't think we can make any sort of 
racially balanced package out of this; we'll have to simply describe 
everyoe as 'people of power who care', and hope that's representative 
enough of sentience in the World.  OTOH, I like the idea of a Dwarf in 
the mix; they are stronly representative of a solid, non-magical element 
that we are otherwise lacking.

4) I don't want to leave anyone behind.  I realize that some sort of 
sacrifice is needed, but tossing entire sentients into the binding 
strikes me as a bit extreme, as well as the sort of thing that could come 
back to haunt us later.  I would propose instead each of us sacrificing a 
point of personal POW to the spell, instead.

5) I don't want people poking holes in the new ward as they depart, 
either.  I would propose two ways around this:
  A - Have the casters as mage-Fortu pairs, with the mages in the 'zone' 
and the Fortu outside.  At the appropriate time, the mage retreats to the 
Fortu.  Rather than creating a hole in the structure, we would be 
removing a barrier to completion.
  B - Use one of Kilsorana's spell-triggers (on a slightly massive scale) 
so that the ward is not actually in existance until after we depart.

6) I'm still in favor of using the power-building phase to mimic the 
magical/elemental pattern of the World, establishing a 'comfortable' 
environment for the Heartstone as we pack it away.  Creation Myths, 
however, seem too complicated a matter to settle quickly; we'd probably 
be better off letting sleeping myths lie, and sticking to secular 
elementalism.

Ummm.. theis spell is too big to use one of Kilsorana's spell triggers
unlessall it was doing was holding a pinhole open for people to escape
through.

Well, at a bare minimum, it will distract people from killing you before 
your incipient godhood, and will 'lock in' (at least to a greater extent 
than now) your Odin-potential.

It will also protect you from some of the machinations (pun intended) of 
the rest of the Five, who seem more content than you to hang out at the 
Machine all day, and who (collectively) may be more clever and insidious 
than you.

It will reduce the occurrances of such surprises as the Living Fortu 
trick, where someone else shifts reality, and doesn't bother having you 
sign off on the paperwork.

It will give you a little more insight into the way the rest of 
Shapeshifters work, should you find yourself wanting to manipulate or 
oppose them later.

It's really good for your reputation to do things like this and live, and 
all the mage-groupie babes will know your name.

Thanks, Myth.  Especially for that last one.  Of course, any babe who would
really be impressed isn't likely to understand what it was that we did, and
the ones who do understand will probably be pissed that we did it but maybe
Madra or Dream will turn their interest from Kay to Morphus ....

Excellent,
	I am glad that Falstaff called because  I was just in the process of deciding when in the time stream I should talk
to him, Logos and Rismaeon.  It doesn't matter to me whether he approaches me first or me him.  I finally decided I am  
going to talk to each of the five (excluding Nuryev) a week or two before execution of the ritual.

Subject:	Falstaff

Falstaff gives you both a  call.   He asks you how things
are going and then he pauses...

So... I was just talking with Morphus.  He has let me know
about your plans to isolate the heartstone.  I have some concerns:

(1) I think the warding should be openable by all the keys currently
extant in the aggregate reality.  What if one gets destroyed?
So if there are only four keys left then four will open the ward.
Three-three.  Etcetera-etcetera

>> Absoultely, good idea, I incorporate it.

(2) I think you should build in a natural decay of about 5 - 10  years
so the Heartstsone will automatically free itself.   Here is why -
the Lich's reality is the strongest reality generations outside of the
God_King's in the world.  As the heartsone dissappears his reality
will have the dominance and will start to grow.  Although i agree
in the SHORT TRERM that the heartstone should be sealed I think
the longer it stays sealed beyond the necessary the moire powerful
the Lich will become.   I am committed to limiting that.

>> Absolutely, good idea.  I had already intended in the ritual that the decay
effect of the heartstones's influence eventually overpower the wards ability
to power itself however I was thinking on the order of 100 years.  I will change
it to 5 years based on your recommendation.

(3) I think we should let Morphus go ahead with his plans for the
Dwarves.  They will provide a solid reliable Earth-basis for the whole
thing and it will make Morphus easier to deal with.  He is much better
now that he doesn't think he is Odin anymore!*phew*  That was a
rough period.

>> Okay.  Whatever floats peoples boats.

(4) Watch for Rysmaeon- he is agaisnt the sealing and thinks it is a bad
idea.
I odn't think he is wasting much iutme on it- but if he sees a
convenient
opportunity to meddle he will take it.

>> What is iutme?  Is this some strange new form of magical energy?  And do
you honestly think I trust Rismaeon farther than I can throw him (which is 
aproximately 12 feet with a good sacrifice throw and I don't even trust him
that far).

(5) Logos and I are coming.  We will just watch thank you.

>>Okay, sounds good to me.  I am assuming that you will watch from outside the
ritual area.  Would you mind assisting with external security since you are going to 
be their anyway?  You can never be too paranoid and I don't think Lenore or Balder
are going to show up out of the blue this time.

Any questions or comments?

>> Just to remind.  My strategy now is to find out about everything which could affect
the ritual, be aware of it and prepare for it/integrate it into the ritual/develop contingencies.

I will probably not be able to come over to you place tonight.  Andrea sounded terrible
this morning and she will probably not go to her SELP.  I think I should take care of her.
We should strategize about what needs to be done before Saturday AM and how we can
handle it.  If you guys still want to meet I could call in by phone.  The things I want to 
accomplish before Saturday are:

1.	Talk to Falstaff, Rismaeon and Logos
2.	Be present if people talk to Nuryev, otherwise don't worry about it
3.	Get everyone aligned on the ritual
4.	Take care of anything else which would prevent us from starting the
	walk towards the heartstone first thing Saturday AM.

By the way, I am assuming the run is at your place (or Jim's?).  What Time?  10:00AM?

Please mention if there is anything to do for #4.  I am having a tough time at work and so
I may not have a physical rewrite of the ritual but if I do not I am going to just say "I have rewritten
the ritual and incorporated people's comments".  Is that OK?

Okay all.  Here is my official consolidation post.  Please respond with
your comments.

The date of Shape Shifters is this Saturday, November 1st.
Location: My place
Time: 10:00 am  until we are done.   I am committed that we get the
Heartsone sealed- or not- this run.  I am targeting 7:00 as the end time
of the run.

Players: Lara, Myth, Jim Jackl-Mochel, Jim Wilson, Chris, and quite
possibly Jack.
Did I miss anybody?

I am going to list things that people have told me that they want to
do.  In this I will include information that is not generally public
knowledge but that I think we have to manage as a group because our time
is limited...I will not reveal any of your secret plans to conquor the
universe.  I have five major things that need to be handled as far as I
know.

(1) Mordanith and Sigmund want to talk to each of the Five.

* This is being handled by ICQ, e-mail, lunch meetings, and tonight.

(2) Morphus wants to go to the Island of Law and recover the Staff of
Law.

* This will either be run as a half-hour snippet during the run on
Sunday or handled tonight by Jim and Chris.

(3) Morphus wants to get the four dwarves he and I have been talking
about to join the ritual.

* I will let this just happen and not run the details.  It is done.
Chris:  Please name the Dwarves and tell me their skills.

(4) We need to get the details of the casting organized.

* Some of this will occur tonight and be done by e-mail.  I am committed
that the design stuff that some of us (like myself) love so much be
moslty complete by Staurday so Saturday be more of a problem -solving
and Adventure run than a theory/design the spell sort of run.  Are you
all with me in that?

(5) We need to decide what NPC are going to the Heartstone.

See below.  This is an important question.

(6) Mordanith, Kay, and Sigmund have been talking about going back in
time to talk to Nureyev.

ACK!  SPITTLE!  GASP!  Please contact me if you guys are going to do
this.  It will be hugely interesting if you suceed and it will entertain
EVERYBODY.  It is an in-run action, not out run.  But
if you do it people will not be bored..:-)  HGoweve rthis is abig deal
requiring major but-in form deities and will be difficult and
dangerous.  Do you want to do it?  Jack? Jims?  Is it worth it?

Okay- back to question Five:

Here is the list of People who have been mentioned as possible
inclusions:

Mordanith
Kay
Sigmund
Morphus
Darius
Pentos
Erythmaeon
Peter
Kilsorana
D'jon
Drellen
4 Dwarves
Logos
Falstaff

Arak
Amud Alleth
Kor Keth
Trevaine
Kelthie
Wei_Lee


That's 23 people!  That is a lot.  Do you need that many?  The othe
rthing is that it will be VERY dangerous!  The trip alone may kill
people.

Supplies Logos will warn you that you need:

At least a weeks worth of food. (it won't take you a week in the prime
but to your characters...)
Climbing gear
Wet weather gear.
Good walking boots or shoes.
Physical weapons
Lanterns and or torches.
Tents/sleeping bags/whatever you would sleep/shelter in at night.

Logos' two biggest warning:
(1)DO NOT ASSUME YOU CAN RELY ON MAGIC OF ANY KIND- INCLUDING ITEMS.
(2) DO NOT TAKE ANYONE THAT CANNOT DEFEND THEMSELVES OR HOLD THEIR OWN.

Please send Alex any comments or thoughts as soon as possible.

>> Given that response I change my position from mildly against to violently opposed.

Okay- back to question Five:

Here is the list of People who have been mentioned as possible
inclusions:

This should be split up as inside the active ritual area:

Mordanith
Sigmund
Morphus
Darius
Pentos
Erythmaeon
Peter
Kilsorana
D'jon
Drellen

A suggestion was made that D'Jan be outside the ward since Divine presence is
impossible within the presence of the heartstone.  If this is true I would be convincable
although I always like having him around.  I have no evidence that this is true however
and unless such evidence is provided I (being the paranoid person that I am) think it
is essential that we have him present to prevent divine influence or manage it if it is 
present.  Even if no random shape shifting gods sneak into the ritual disguised as 
someone's belt buckle there are at least three characters present who could spontaneously
emit divine energy in the presence of a wild magic like mana hurricane.

And outside the active ritual area (I am not sure whether you wanted the dwarves as casters or
supporters Chris) but in the heartstones presence:

Kay
4 Dwarves
Logos
Falstaff
Trevaine (I think we need only one gaurdian we could probably leave Kelfi)
Arak

People I would rather leave behind:
Amud Alleth
Kor Keth (Not to discriminate against him but I hadn't thought he would be interested)
Kelthie
Wei_Lee

I think we should evaluate whether Amud could make it without assistance.  I feel the same
about Arak and Wei Lee but I have a little more confidence in their ability to deal with strange
magics and bizarre environments.  I originally was thinking to not bring Kor'Keth or Kelfi to keep 
the numbers low.  If we are bringing a lot of squishies we might want to include them so that
they can act in bodygaurd roles.  I would rather keep it small though.


That's 23 people!  That is a lot.  Do you need that many?  The othe
rthing is that it will be VERY dangerous!  The trip alone may kill
people.

Supplies Logos will warn you that you need:

At least a weeks worth of food. (it won't take you a week in the prime
but to your characters...)
Climbing gear
Wet weather gear.
Good walking boots or shoes.
Physical weapons
Lanterns and or torches.
Tents/sleeping bags/whatever you would sleep/shelter in at night.

Logos' two biggest warning:
(1)DO NOT ASSUME YOU CAN RELY ON MAGIC OF ANY KIND- INCLUDING ITEMS.
(2) DO NOT TAKE ANYONE THAT CANNOT DEFEND THEMSELVES OR HOLD THEIR OWN.

>>Interesting.  When this suggestion is made I might ask Logos what the source of his information is.  Has he been there?

Please send Alex any comments or thoughts as soon as possible.

Oh I that's too bad.  I think Jim Wilson is a much better actor... ACK!  Blood squirts as Alex is suddenly attacked from

Again Logos will speak.

"The prohibition against Divine beings is simply that the heartstones will turbuliunce is such that any connections to outside
sources will be severed or severely damaged in the prescence of the Stone.

"Lord Paladin Kay should be fine because of the strength of his Bonds though he shouldn't enter the ritual area itself.
I recommend against him- points to Arak- as his connection is weak enough that it will probably be violently severed in the
prescence of the Stone.    All of the Fortu net connections will also go down- though as long as they are shut down first it
will cause no damage.

> And outside the active ritual area (I am not sure whether you wanted the dwarves as casters or
> supporters Chris) but in the heartstones presence:

I believe Chris wanted the Dwarves in the ritual area itself as a counter balance to Kilsorana and Mordanith.(Logos approves
of that BTW)  By the way Pook:  I gave you bad numbers at lunch.  Morphus contribution to the spell design is only 40 design
points.  My apologies.

Kor Keth is not interested but willing if you want him to go.

Kelthie would just a soon return to his mission for Dora.

> Wei_Lee

Same with Wei-Lee.  Very busy but willing if Kilsorana wants him to go. Lara?

> I think we should evaluate whether Amud could make it without assistance.

Amud is actually quite the warrior.  he is an extraordinary fencer, but doesn't have many skills for dealing with magical
threats except a killer psi-shield Kilsorana has been teaching him...

Logos has been to the Heart Stone 3 times.  He is the current world expert on the Heartstone/Machine Interface and has never
been to the Heartstone in this reality.  He expects the terrain and challenges to be quite different.  He does however
understand the defense's topology and the design of the creation of the defenses....

Location: My place
Time: 10:00 am  until we are done.   I am committed that we get the
Heartsone sealed- or not- this run.  I am targeting 7:00 as the end time

>> Cool.

Players: Lara, Myth, Jim Jackl-Mochel, Jim Wilson, Chris, and quite

Did I miss anybody?

>> Not me.  


I am going to list things that people have told me that they want to
do.  In this I will include information that is not generally public
knowledge but that I think we have to manage as a group because our time
is limited...I will not reveal any of your secret plans to conquor the
universe.  I have five major things that need to be handled as far as I
know.

>> Thanks for keeping my secret.  The rest of 'em won't figure it out for
years, anyhow.


(1) Mordanith and Sigmund want to talk to each of the Five.

* This is being handled by ICQ, e-mail, lunch meetings, and tonight.

>> Fine by me.  I trust Sigmund's judgement.


(2) Morphus wants to go to the Island of Law and recover the Staff of
Law.

* This will either be run as a half-hour snippet during the run on
Sunday or handled tonight by Jim and Chris.

>> Another artifact?  I hope we're having a charity auction or something
afterward, cause the mystic wheelbarrow's getting a little full.


(3) Morphus wants to get the four dwarves he and I have been talking
about to join the ritual.

* I will let this just happen and not run the details.  It is done.
Chris:  Please name the Dwarves and tell me their skills.

>> No.  I got burned once on the Rainbow Monastery deal, and I WILL NOT
blandly let Morphus add people 
to the ritual without knowing a litlte about  them and why they are needed.
 (NEEDED, not just nice to have.)  
Call me paranoid, if you like, but I this smells like one of Morphus'
Clever Ideas (patent pending), and I'm not in the mood to get betrayed
again.

>> If either you or  these guys betray us, Morphus, I will see you dead.


(4) We need to get the details of the casting organized.

* Some of this will occur tonight and be done by e-mail.  I am committed
that the design stuff that some of us (like myself) love so much be
moslty complete by Staurday so Saturday be more of a problem -solving
and Adventure run than a theory/design the spell sort of run.  Are you
all with me in that?

>> Sounds good.


(5) We need to decide what NPC are going to the Heartstone.

See below.  This is an important question.

>> Agreed.  This is NOT a parade event.


(6) Mordanith, Kay, and Sigmund have been talking about going back in
time to talk to Nureyev.

ACK!  SPITTLE!  GASP!  Please contact me if you guys are going to do
this.  It will be hugely interesting if you suceed and it will entertain
EVERYBODY.  It is an in-run action, not out run.  But
if you do it people will not be bored..:-)  HGoweve rthis is abig deal
requiring major but-in form deities and will be difficult and
dangerous.  Do you want to do it?  Jack? Jims?  Is it worth it?

>> Sounds like a major detour to me.  I'm against it unless it is vital to
the ritual.


Okay- back to question Five:

Here is the list of People who have been mentioned as possible
inclusions:

Mordanith
Kay
Sigmund
Morphus
Darius
Pentos
Erythmaeon
Peter
Kilsorana
D'jon
Drellen
4 Dwarves
Logos
Falstaff

Arak
Amud Alleth
Kor Keth
Trevaine
Kelthie
Wei_Lee


That's 23 people!  That is a lot.  Do you need that many?  The othe
rthing is that it will be VERY dangerous!  The trip alone may kill
people.

>> Arak is a paladin.  Will this cause problems?  Also, I don't really want
to bring the ENTIRE World population of Fortu.. it seems somehow excessive.
 My opinion on the Four Dwarfs is stated above; I would feel better without
them.  Why are we including Falstaff?  Do we need him?  Can we spare him
from all the other World-shaking meddling he usually does?  ...And it's
spelled "Erithmaeon".

Supplies Logos will warn you that you need:

At least a weeks worth of food. (it won't take you a week in the prime
but to your characters...)
Climbing gear
Wet weather gear.
Good walking boots or shoes.
Physical weapons
Lanterns and or torches.
Tents/sleeping bags/whatever you would sleep/shelter in at night.

>> I can get all that, even assuming non-magical good-quality (durable and
lightweight) stuff.  I would also like to add a change of clothes for the
ritual, appropriately sealed against whatever magical mayhem we may
encounter on the way.


Logos' two biggest warning:
(1)DO NOT ASSUME YOU CAN RELY ON MAGIC OF ANY KIND- INCLUDING ITEMS.
(2) DO NOT TAKE ANYONE THAT CANNOT DEFEND THEMSELVES OR HOLD THEIR OWN.

>> Since E-man has no magical items (thank you very much, O Collectors of
Artifacts), he doesn't care about the first one.  And he has been training
to qualify for the second part, in between the rest of his life.


Please send Alex any comments or thoughts as soon as possible.

>> Hokay. 

                                -Myth.

Great.  That seems to be universal.

Okay- that is done then.  Unless Kay insists we aren't going to do that!

Your sentinal will, of course come.  It is up to Kilsorana if Wei-lee comes or not.

No.  It is unlikely that they will survive in Logos' opinion.

ALL.  No exceptions.   Oops!  Not true:  Sentient, context-generating items will still work:
elves, the Fortu, mistslicer (though she would have no magical powers, be unable to communicate
and essentially be a hunk of weak silver), basically just the elves and the Fortu.

Certain alchemical and thaumaturgic magics that operate at a very fundamental level may still
work.  MAY!

Subject:	Reminder

Hi Guys & Gals,

	I don't have much time but I was just reading through e-mail and I realized that no
one had replied to one of my original requests.  In order to have the ritual have any chance 
of success at all we all need to know every single person who is going to be in the ritual area
and every single thing they will have on them.  I think it would be important to know at least 
which people will be in the "viewing area" but I will let this go for the moment.

Therefor from every person I need two things:
1.	What will you have on your person during the ritual.  List everything including clothes.
2.	I would like everyone to agree that if anybody else brings something unplanned for into
	the ritual no matter how trivial we all force them to leave it in the "viewing area".
While this may seem a harsh policy I am just reacting to the extreme delicacy of the situation.

People I assume will be in the ritual area:
Sigmund, Mordenaith, Morphus, Kilsorana, Erithmaeon
Darius, Pentos, Peter, Drellan
D'Jan (still under contention)
4 dwarves (still under contention)

Please let there be no suprises here!

Things I personally will be bringing - 
My Rod
My Necklace of Wizardries
Otherwise I will be naked

Things that will be brought in general
the 20 dodecahedrons
these are the only physical spell components of which I am aware!

Alex, I assume all other Fortu will be naked while in the ritual area.  Is this true?
I will certainly not be naked when traveling to the ritual but I will strip before purifying the area.From:	Alexander M. Jackl [ajackl@avs.com]

Encumbrance.  Remember you will be relying on your strength, con, and build to carry things and any
porters are not likely to survive AND likely to be a detriment.  Sooooo...

You can only effectively carry (STR*4 + CON + BLD + WGT/4)/3 with minimal minuses and half that with
no minuses!

That is pounds - we don't do volume in the calculation but i will be harping on volume so beware if
you are bringing  your skis/quarterstaffs, spears, trunks, etc.  I will role-play volume as a
problem!:-)

Rememebr you have to carry all the material components for the ritual as well as your survival gear.

THose if you who are not very physical- be careful- you will be using physical endurance like air and
I recommend those of you who are not REALLY fit to carry below half your encumbrance or pay dearly...

I am goingto answer for the NPCs and even for the dwarfs.

All fortu but Sigmund will be naked.

D'jan will remain outside the ritual area and be listening for divine intervention.

> 4 dwarves (still under contention)

They will agree- reluctantly- to strip off everything but: Their Holy Symbols(which are their foci) and
their staves of office(which are also foci).The holy symbols are adamantium anvils on a dwarven steel
chain link belt.
The staves are ironwood staves keyed to fire and earth and Moradin.

> Things that will be brought in general

Those are the only ones I am aware of as well.  Logos will recommend that some spell anchors be brought to
mark the edges of the ritual area and to hold the mana turbulence to a minuimum in the ritual area.

A good question.... a Haalite key- without a box- weighs only about a
pound.  However the box to hold it in wieghs about two pounds for a
light box and four pounds for a sturdy metal one.

They are fragile- haalite shatters.  (Alex is being devious here- it
does shatter and is a brittle material but the foot-pounds of impact
necessary to shatter haalite is pretty intense.  But a fall from a
height would do it- so the boxes are probably a good idea!  And the
boxes keep the haalite purified and uncontaminated.

 Relatively serious- you will have to deal with severe emotional
depression and apathy, as well as a complete experience of no grounding
and purposelessness.

You can hold off the physical problems:  fragmentation, decomposition,
etc.  sheerly by setting up a simple, internal ward.  (For you it is a
-50 casting of a ward.  Takes 5 MEN an hour to maintain and you will
have it even in no manna zones since it is internal....  So inother
words- 12 MEX a day.  This will also ease the psychological problems
though not eliminate them.

Hokay.

In the ritual;

1. Erithmaeon.  Unmodified human, Dorian sub-race.  Has been off-plane, 
has been exposed to Wild Magic.

2. Ritual Garb (optional).  Light robe, woven for ritual use and magical 
non-interference. Transported to site in sealed neutral container.  E-man 
is willing to forgo this at the slightest request.

3. Focus (optional).  Silk threads, as magically unflavored as possible, 
for use in laying spell lines.  These will make a 20% difference to a 
number of E-man's magical effects.  He is willing to forgo them at a 
strong request.


Waiting in the lounge;

1. Mage-guild contact ring (optional).  Standard will-malleable item, 
with contact and transport-focus abilities.  Not expected to be useful 
past the first stages of the trip, anyway.  Will forgo at any reasonable 
request.

2. Clothing and camping supplies.

3. Sword (very well-made, non-magical) and Whip (well-made, non-magical, 
but with weaver runes worked into its construction).  The only weapons 
E-man is particularly competant with.

4. A small loom (big enough to make scarves or hand towels), and some 
weaving supplies.  Non-magical.

5. Haalite 'anchor' stone (from the last run; gifted by Morphus) 
(optional)


Hope that's okay.

Thank you,

	I don't think there is any reason that the humans in the ritual be naked.  Also it would prbably be a good idea
if the haalite vertex were in the ritual area, since it is part of the ritual.

I have now heard from:
	Alex on behalf of the NPCs
	Myself (yes I do talk to myself)
	Myth
	Jim JM - verbally (he will bring the chain and nothing else (except I am assuming the haalite vertex)
	Chris - Unknown
	Kilsorana - Unknown

If I do not hear anything from the last two I will assume that they are naked and bereft of possessions (which could be interesting
in the case of Kilsorana - I am a rock, but I am a male rock).  Remember, this is vital to the success of the ritual.  I have
learned recently that the dwarves who are coming with us are going to end up sealed inside the ward.  They are perfectly aware
of this and have volunteered for the assignment.  They are purely for flavoring purposes and there is nothing else being sealed 
in the ward with them.  I have a plan in place to check them out completely from a security perspective (Chris is going to deliver them to me a few weeks ahead of time and I will give them a good check to make sure they are not dopplegangers or republicans or anything scary like that).  In general I think this is a reasonable and safe addition to the ritual and I am usually in favor of other
peoples agendas as long as they are not hidden.

This is in response to some questions of Pookie's.

JACK:  You cannot wear the Golden armor.  When you enter the no-magic zone it will weigh in excess of 800 pounds.  You won't be able to
move.
You will also have to seal up your connection to Heimdell and Arioch.  When you enter the final level next to the heart stone you will be
injured if you don't.


Those of you at last night's meeting will know some of this- but note- I went over my notes and my Deity design and here is a more realistic
set of numbers- a bit different from what I told you last night.

Pook: Also different than my first pop response to this- these are the accurate numbers!  Please delete and discard the old ones.

This a list of the current reality influence distributions:  Note that they are a little deceptive because there are other factors:  for
instance the percentage is broken up into static/momentum based influence, and active/creative influence.  The Lich's 2% is scary
because it is almost all active creative influence- while the Heimdells, Mardra's and the Tolnian's reality is 95% static reality.

So the first numbe ris the "amount" of the relaity effected.  The "context mass" if you will.  The next number is the ACTIVE percentage of
that mass that is in momnetum, that is changing and shaping the world reality.  The number after the dash then is the "influence number"
generated by taking the percentage of the context mass of the relaity and loweirng that to its "effective number".
It is really just a ranking .  Notice Heimdell is only 4 and the Lich is 1.9  The Lich has the thrid-highest effective numbe rin the world
and he is in full momentum.  He is gaining a percentage every six months! 

And although Mardra and the New Gods and Faerie all for the most part oppose the Lich- they also waste active points opposing each other and
Hell is on the Lichs side.  They also waste points fighting the Abyss and Hell.   Very confusing and not good for our heroes!  :-)

Heimdell/Bifrost: 40% [includes Arioch, Grey Wanderers, Zen Cha, Dau Penn]<10% ACTIVE- 4>
Mardra/RING: 20% <8% ACTIVE- 1.6>
Tolnian/New Gods: 10%<15% ACTIVE- 1.5>
Hell/Underworld: 10%<30% ACTIVE- 3>
Faerie: 7%<50% ACTIVE- 3.5>
Independant: ~7% [the Elder, some Draconics, No-Rennan, the Outerplanes races, Preceptors, Miriel's people, the Five]<30% ACTIVE- 2.1>
God-king: 3%<0% ACTIVE- 0>
Lich: 2%<95% ACTIVE- 1.9>
Abyss: 1%<100% ACTIVE- 1>
Odin: .03%<80% ACTIVE- .024>

After Morphus' plans with the dwarves and the Staff, the Odin reality will leap up to around 5% of the active reality in five years and and
Faerie will lose 1%, the LICH will lose 1%, and Heimdell will lose 3%.

(2).      About the staff of law
Pookie says:

D'jan is really busy and is working out what Divine problems you might encounter and is
working hard at figuring this out.  He will only provide 10 SRP.

He can carry 150 # with absolutley no minuses and 300# with minimal  minuses.

Kor'Keth is not going unles syou specifically ask him too.  Pentos and Peter have slightly
less than you.  Say- 24# of ENC.  D'jan will
have the same.  Drellan will have slightly more- say 40#.

Subject:	Magic Items/Ritual

     I didn't expect to have any questions about magic items, but I woke 
up with one this morning, so here goes.

     What about Ironcloth?  I would expect it not to work much of the 
way, but it is not heavy and will be useful once we reach our 
destination, at least if there's combat to be had (and when *isn't* there 
combat to be had with this group?)

     E-man will check with his old master to see what ironcloth is like 
without magic (if the elemental just wanders off, for instance, it's just 
a really expensive silk shirt) and with Logos for possible metaphysical 
side effects.

     If it sounds promising, he will then act as agent for any Shifters 
orders.  (Note- he will *not* be making it himself; prices will be 
astronomical, particularly for rush and custom jobs.)

You know that is agood question.  Iron cloth may actually retain its
properties.  Hmmm...

No- you see the elemnetal is physically woven into the material so it is not
a spell...I iwll have to think about it.  I am deciding arbitrarily that
Ironcloth is stable enough that it is just like ordinary cloth as far as
rituals go.

We are tryng to limit the number of support personnel because of the
dange rof the mission and because of the delicacy of the ritual.  We are
trying to keep people to a small number.

It is if it is contained- but once opened it starts to evaporate rapidly
so you need to drink quick or have lots of small containers! :-)

Role-playing.  You are tommorrow.  Didn't anyone tell Kilsoranan.... you
have at least a week's journey on foot to get to the Heartstone.

Kilsorana will need five times the water of any of the humans at least!

Subject:	SHifters: Food & Water

This is from Britt.  It also matches my experience so let's go with it.

I'd go with 3 quarts / per person / day of strenuous activity.
    MORDANITH: 1 quart
    KILSORANA: 15 quarts

How much does a quart of water weigh again, Pook?

Britt says:
Heat matters A LOT!  On a hot day you need a lot more water
 I tend to drink around 2 quarts per /day while hiking and then a couple

more during meals.

I say:
You will mostly be cold and wet.  (drinkable- I don't think so!)

Britt says:
2 lbs. of food is close. Of course, dried stuff takes more water to
prepare.

I say:
There you go!

Britt says:
 My pack for a typical 5-7 day hike weights about 45-50 lbs.  I'd say 10

of that is food and the rest is gear.  Of course I don't carry a sword,
just a Sven saw.  :-)

Be prepared....


 -Britt

(1) I still am reaquesting that everyone who can print out a copy ot the

hope somebody will.

(2) Bring hardcopy of any email or questions you have- I am only
prointing my gm notes about the scenario.  If I responded to you and you
need that response- print it out or write it down!

(3) Have your equipment lists ready.  I DO NOT expect you to have them
finished or not have questions!  That is fine.  But have your special
requests prepared- don't be thinking about it.  I iwll be going
lightning fast from person to person- what are you bringing?  What are
your requests if any?
Write down what you are binging!  If I have a question I iwll say - wher
eis it on your equipmewnt list- and if you don't have it down - you
didn't bring it! :-)

(4) Have your character sheets ready in Rev 6.  Be ready to track
endurance and combat statistics (wounded mods etc.  There will be a
great deal of danger and conflict - be prepared.


All this may seem tyrannical but tommorows run will be great- lots of
good stuff and I want to do it all!
