MDF	437     -90
MAB	63      -7
POW	41      
MEN	1086    -90


Magic Based saves all went down -180
INF save increased by +90

ALL wizardries went down almost exactly 40%

The absolute chances are still very good.

most are still in the 250-300 ranges assuming 
that they are able to continue to use the SCF skills I
was using as secondaries and generals and tertiaries.
If I go over to INF only secondaries and so on the total drop 
averages about 60%
