RE: Gaming (D&D) strategy problem - SOLUTION?	"I suppose the basic premise is workable.  Just a few observations:

Not to be mercenary but there is a certain cost-benefit analysis here.  If
we combine the incremental risk to the gaurdian for each trip with the
combat values of a dwarf and a gaurdian and assume that if things screw up
we could likely take a gaurdian casualty.  with all of these factors there
is a break-even point were it just makes more sense to send the Gaurdian to
the front and have the Dwarves do something else.  I don't think we are at
that point  but we should be aware of it.

Calculations R' Us}

A though about Dwarf weight: Screw the armour and weapons!  If you have
super-mage with you leave all your weapons and armour (except the artifacts)
and re-create them on the other side.  Or gate them in, people will care
much less if a bunch of metal gets swiped than actual people.  This reduces
us to 80kg per dwarf and we get 3-per-load at 10% encumbrance.

I will do the encumbrance numbers out but I think it is really irrelevant. I
think the major bottleneck will be Troll reset time.  Each dwarf batch will
require two trips (gaurdians+dwarves, gaurdians-go-back).  Between each trip
we have to wait for the Troll to go back in the pit (otherwise this gets
really hairy - dodging an actively gaurding Troll in a small corridor).  I
think, though the Troll is dumb, he will catch on very soon.  In fact, it
may only work a few times and then we may have to wait days for the troll to
reset.  How do we know when the Troll has reset (reset = gone back into the
pit)?

Just as a note.  A Fortu (Kor'Keth) has successfully hidden from a Troll
(albeit a young one) at close range before.  This was in the throne room of
the Wizard King and he was motionless and shitting brocks at the time but
stealth mode may be of some use here.  I forget what Guardian stealth mode
is like though.  I don't remember ever using it when in that mode.

I am leary about the idea of using Gaurdian-speed and Vartigan-control as
alternating tactics.  I was planning on being one of the Gaurdians, and even
if I wasn't it seems trusting ALOT to dice luck.  I was hoping we could use
them both at the same time.  I.e. vartigan holds the troll and bay and
Gaurdians whip the dwarves through as fast as possible to maximize the use
of time.  Then if things start to fall apart we can contingency plan with a
hopefully survivable escape plan.  The advantage is that with Vartigan, I
think when things start to break down we will get a little notice.  With the
gaurdian-speed thing I think it is just a series of near misses until one
hits and then it is too late.

With 4 guardians, unarmoured dwarves (=3 per load at <10% encumbrance), two
trips per load and 11,000 dwarves to transport I still see 1833 trips (916
loads).  Still, I think this is a workable solution.  Let me calculate some
more.

RE: Gaming (D&D) strategy problem - SOLUTION?	"Quick tactical strawman

<PLAN>
Team Sets up at the Heimdella end.

Four gaurdians do a quick run through dropping Vartigan just prior to the
pit.

Vartigan waits to acquire lock on the Troll and starts trying to keep it in
the pit.

Four gaurdians begin shuttle missions keeping together (single file through
the doors but not seperating too much).

I will calculate the total time for each trip but my gut is that it will be
on the OOM of 1 per second yielding a throughput (2 trips per load) of about
6 dwarves per second.

If Vartigan performs a roll every 5 seconds we could pass through until
either his hold starts to slip or 5 minutes have elapsed (300 trips, 150
loads and 60 rolls).  Then we perform an orderly retreat, regroup and rest.

Once the Troll has had a chance to reset (estimate 30 minutes for rest and
reset) repeat the whole process.

Each insertion would traverse about 1800 dwarves so about 6 insertions would
be required.

If Vartigans hold began to slip we would make that trip the last and pull
Vartigan out.

If a Gaurdian got hit or Vartigan disasterously lost his hold we would drop
all dwarves being carried (sorry guys) and do a combat retreat protecting
Vartigan and the Gaurdians (and the Dwarves but not at the risk of the
others unless maybe it was Dora or the Dwarf King).
