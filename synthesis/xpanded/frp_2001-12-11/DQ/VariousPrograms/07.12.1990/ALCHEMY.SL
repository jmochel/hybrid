HD01O
Each material is composed of several attributes. 
HD01O
Substance can never be changed or altered. Substance can be bound or unbound. Substance can be mixed with substance. 
HD01O
Essence can be changed, or at least added or removed. Completely removing essence is costly in terms of time and energy. Note that materials that have their essence removed are metastable and will associate with the nearest available essence.
HD01O
Form can be changed with some difficulty. The three forms have a hiearchy, with the easiet to manipulate being mineral and the  least manipulatable being animal. 
HD01O
State can be fairly easily changed. It also has a hierarchy. Going from solid to Aether requires the most energy and going from Aether to Solid requires the least. The changes require that the material be exposed to the appropriate essence. *note that the essence itself is unaffected.
