</ADDRESS>

As many of you know, on Oct 26 I started off a discussion on SF
Genres, basically asking people which they preferred, Hard-SF or
Soft-SF. Responses came back indicating that Hard-SF was
preferred predominantly over the more cinematic styles of Star
Wars, Star Trek, and the rest of their Soft-SF ilk. It wasn't so
much the technological level of Star Wars (versus, say, 2001)
which bothered people. It was more the logical discrepancies, the
"gonzotech" in Eric Tolle's words, and the "annoying shallowness"
to paraphrase Phil Goetz. Neelakantan Krishnaswami argued that
High-Tech is okay, but only insofar as it is rigorously thought
out, not only in terms of technological repercussions but also in
terms of the social and economic ramifications. Even Erol
Bayburt, who preferred the cinematic style of Soft-SF, agreed
that no matter how you bend (or break) science, the final result
must, at least, be internally consistent.

All these responses got me to thinking that if rigorous internal
consistency is so highly prized, then we've got ourselves a
whopper of a problem right off the bat. What problem? Fermi's
Question, of course. And that was the central subject of my Nov 9
follow-up article.

What is Fermi's question? Basically, stated, it's: "Where are
they?"

"They" as in the extra-terrestrials. Enrico Fermi, the nobel-
prize winning physicist purportedly posed this question at a
social dinner many moons ago, captivating his listeners with the
perplexity of probabilities which argue that extra-terrestrials
ought to exist versus the apparently obvious fact that they are
nowhere to be found. For us modern-day munchkins, this isn't so
much of a problem. We can rationalize the dilemma in any number
of ways, the three most obvious being:

   (1) Extra-terrestrials don't exist, at least not in this
       galaxy. We are the one and only example of sentience
       anywhere in the Milky Way. The probabilities are just
       way less than people realize.

   (2) They do exist, but they can't visit us because of the
       imponderable difficulties of interstellar travel. And
       while they might be able to communicate with us, they've
       never seen any point in trying.

   (3) They do exist, and they have visited us, but they want
       to leave us alone for the time being and see how we do.
       If they do interact with our governments at all, it's
       behind the scenes, where they won't be noticed. As for
       us trying to tune in to their interstellar internet,
       there's really no point in trying. They use real-time
       fractal compression and spread-spectrum communications
       and tachyon pulses and whatnot, so don't even bother.
       We're not in the same league, much less the same
       ballpark.

However, for the writer of a science fiction setting which is
"rigorously internally consistent" and yet has a high-speed,
cinematic, starwars/trekish, go-anywhere-and-quickly sort of
flavor, we find that none of these rationalizations hold up.
Number one doesn't hold up for obvious reasons. After all, there
are aliens in Trek. Number two is weak. You mean we're the only
ones to discover warp drive? And number three... well, if this
were true, then any voyage into the unknown would stumble across
some monstrously huge, tremendously ancient, and extraordinarily
advanced alien civilization. Obviously, since humans dominate a
huge section of space in Star Trek as well as Star Wars, probably
the single two most famous SF settings to date (which is why they
are being used in this discussion), one would think that this is
not the case.

So the questions is, how do we rationalize this inconsistency?

I mentioned one possible solution from Michael McCollum's
_Antares Dawn_, but forsake it as being too limiting on
interstellar travel for my own personal tastes. Bertil Jonell,
one of the more renowned of the TML denizens, replied with a
whole laundry list of explanations. I've taken two of these and
perverted them slightly.

   (1) Berzerkers: Some ancient space-faring civilization, the
       first boys on the block, in fact, decided to send out
       a huge armada of Berzerker robots. These robots were
       capable of self-replication through some fixed number
       of iterations. They were also loaded with all manner
       of nuclear armaments. When they'd detect the first
       signs of a possible competitive civilization, usually
       though reception of radio broadcasts and whatnot, they'd
       mosey on over and drop a few bombs. End of problem.
       Well, due to some error in the programming, the
       berzerkers in this section of the galaxy just sort of
       stopped functioning for some reason (who knows, maybe
       they became self-aware and developed moral qualms),
       so all of a sudden, we get lots of races popping their
       heads up at roughly the same time, and we Humans just
       so happen to be in this wave. Stumbling across one of
       these high-tech berzerker relics could be a major event
       of the campaign.

   (2) Battlefield Earth: Warring/Scheming High-Tech powers fight
       their battles indirectly, through puppet societies and
       various low-end civilizations. Earth (or the "Terran
       Republic") becomes entangled in this conflict. We are
       supported by one power and embroiled in a war with other
       races which are supported by other powers. It may even be
       the case that Humanity was "uplifted" for this very
       purpose. In an odd sort of way, the situation is
       reminiscent of that of Gods settling their petty disputes
       though the races which they created and which they
       control.

Bertil had some other interesting ideas, but I omitted them as
they resulted in settings with a far different feel from what I'm
looking for. Plus, a few of them seemed so bizarre that even
Bertil admitted they were cop-outs.

Richard Baker suggested another idea which I'll touch on briefly.

   (3) The NanoVirus: Way back when the first two civilizations
       had their great war, some whacko conceived and released a
       nanite (a microscopic machine) capable of infiltrating a
       lifeform of fairly broad parameters, replicating and
       surreptitiously spreading through the lifeform's species,
       and after a given delay, killing all the lifeforms with
       which it has come into contact. Hence, not only did it
       destroy the first war's winner, but as other civilizations
       came to inspect the ruins of that war, it infiltrated and
       destroyed their civilizations as well. The downside of
       this idea is that it is only a matter of time before it
       comes after us. "Spock, look at this. These ancient
       records say that the Argoans were destroyed just like all
       those other civilizations.... by a little mach.... ack!"

While Geoffrey Grabowski felt this idea smacked of political
statement, my only qualm with it is that it doesn't leave enough
room for *lots* of aliens co-mingling in a vast interstellar
community.

Anders Sandberg suggested another option having to do with
current worm-hole theory. "If wormholes work as they appear to do
in theory, an expanding wormhole empire will meet other empires
at roughly the same era, regardless of their age and distance!
(See Traversable Wormholes by Michael Price, archived at
http://www.nada.kth.se/~nv91-asa/Trans/wormholes.txt for this)."

I haven't yet taken a look at it, but I'm sure I will sometime in
the near future. As for other reading/viewing material:

*  Neil Mackie suggests _2001 Nights_, a collection of Japanese
   graphic novels. An English translation is distributed by Viz
   comics.

*  Peter Tupper suggests David Brin's _Uplift_ series which
   incidentally served as the basis for a GURPS supplement by the
   same name. He also suggests David Gerrold's _Chess with the
   Dragon_.

*  Jim Cambias echoed Peter's comments regarding _Uplift_. He
   also suggested a new television series: Earth 2.

Just to finish up the recap of responses, John Kim was annoyed
over my intimation that SF campaigns should have aliens in order
to be interesting. "SF campaigns can be about anything:
espionage, colonization, mystery, war, police work, trading
missions, horror, and loads more." John also stated that advanced
civilizations could stay hidden if they wanted to (for example,
the Q-Continuum, ala Star Trek fame).

As to the second point, I feel it ranks down there on the list of
cliches. I think John actually felt this way as well, judging
from his remarks.

As to the first point, I apologize if I sounded like I was
putting down anyone's campaign. I guess I'm wrapped-up in the
idea of putting together an SF-setting with a StarWarzish flavor,
and since that flavor necessitates aliens (and preferably lots of
them), I've been steering the discussion in that direction.

No disrespect intended to those of you who don't make use of
aliens. I actually count myself among your number, as I've been
steering away from aliens for several years now mainly because
the Fermi question has been such a bother.

It is worth noting that J.D. Frazer posted some details regarding
his 21st century science-fiction cops campaign in response to the
aliens issue. He was trying to show that you can have a perfectly
good SF campaign without aliens, and it's true, you can. But, of
course, for those of us who want to incorporate aliens due to
whatever personal prejudices we hold dear, this bit of reasoning
isn't extrodinarily helpful. Hence, while I felt his key point
(and John's) was somewhat off topic, I felt his basic reason for
steering clear of aliens to be very much on topic. Enough so that
I'll do a full quote.

>Here's a problem: Introducing this super powerful alien
>civilization means that the game has to take into account the
>vast economic, social, psychological and technological
>differences. Ferchrissakes, I can't even predict what *we're*
>going to have a lousy 50 years from now. An advanced alien
>civilization? By definition it would drift into the realm of
>science *fantasy*.

Unless, of course, we have a technological ceiling up ahead,
which would derail this argument, at least insofar as the
technology issue is concerned. And if social and economic aspects
are tied to technology, as one might argue, well... you can see
my point easily enough. In any case, yes, having aliens in a
campaign necessitates lots of work, at least if you want to do it
well. Is it really worth it in the end? I guess that question can
only be answered on an individual basis. My supposition in
starting this thread was that it is worth it, or that it's at
least worth exploring.

At this point, however, I think I'll hang back and switch over to
another thread, even though there were numerous other responses
which I could site (including a rather Malthusian thesis proposed
by Bertil that Fermi's question may be solved by the notion of
mandatory self-extermination, i.e., that any given race, even a
space-faring one, must outstrip its resources and self-destruct
as a mathematical inevitability due to the rather mundane fact
that spherical volume grows more rapidly than surface area as a
sphere of colonization expands in size). I leave you techno-
junkies to calculate this out on your pocket TIs.

Now, as to that other topic I promised... ah yes... here it is.
World Building.

Ahem. This could take some time.

In my follow-up article of Nov 9, I proposed a fairly generic
classification scheme which, me being a humanities major (that is
my perennial excuse, by the way), I felt was just vague enough to
be useful. It went something like this:

   Solar Companion: Not technically a world but not the main star
      or even a part of the close-binary pair.
   Gas Giant: Fairly obvious. Great for wilderness refueling if
      we're using hydrogen to get around.
   Greenhouse: A world gone to hell because of too much
      greenhouse gases.
   Planetoid: A very small world, generally. Not necessarily
      round. No atmosphere to speak of. Composed of rock or ice.
   Belch Ball: You don't want to breath the atmosphere. Probably
      corrosive in the extreme.
   Primordial: A very young world. Atmosphere varies.
      Geologically instable. Lots of volcanos and magma seas.
   Desert World: Breathable atmosphere (at least with filter or
       compressor) but no water that isn't tied up as ice
       crystals in the soil.
   Exotic: Not an atmosphere you want to breath, maybe because it
      contains poisonous gasses or even lethal micro-organisms.
      But not a place you can't otherwise walk around, so long as
      you have your own oxygen supply. Note that an alien
      ecosystem may well be thriving.
   Magma Ball: Ouch, this place is hot.
   Vacuum Ball: Like the moon, essentially. Lots of rock. No
      atmosphere.
   Shallow World: Has atmosphere but not enough to breath, at
      least not without descending to a very deep altitude. Mars
      could be an example.
   Dead World: The place is certainly colonizable, but for one
      reason or another, life either never existed or went
      extinct long ago. Maybe its an ice-world. Or maybe it's a
      near desert. Maybe the sun flared and knocked out the
      entire ecosystem. Or maybe a slew of meteors struck,
      churning up enough dust that the sun was blotted out for
      decades.
   Garden World: Earth is a prime example. Not only can you
      breath the atmosphere without mechanical aid, but life,
      either native or transplanted, thrives in abundance.
   Water World: Over 90% covered by water and ice. Possibly a
      breathable atmosphere. Possibly a teaming native ecosystem
      which got evolutionarily stuck due to the total lack of any
      freestanding continents.

I didn't get quite as many comments on this puppy, but I was
surprised to see that one reader did catch me red-handed in the
act of plagiarism... er... I mean research. Right! That's it.
Research! :-)

Mitch Gold, (if memory serves) the former moderator for
rec.games.frp.archives, sent me a copy of the following planetary
classification scheme which was posted to rec.games.frp many eons
ago and which bears a suspicious similarity to the one I posted
on Nov 9.

In fact, this table was originally printed (to the best of my
knowledge) in a book entitled _Worlds of the Federation_ by
Shane Johnson. I chose this table as a basis for what I was
doing, not so much because I like the trek classification system,
but because I always feel this strange compulsion to base my work
on *something*, and this table happened to be sitting in front of
my when the compulsion hit me. In any case, my perversions of
this table were never approved by Paramount. :-)

As for comments on the scheme, Bertil suggested looking into
2300AD. I did, briefly, and I have more to say about that later.
Anders, meanwhile, noted that while broad classification can be
useful, it's important to recognize that each planet is unique,
and hence, one must not overlook the details. And speaking of
details, Nick Janow took me up on my explanation of "Desert
World".

>> Desert World: Breathable atmosphere (at least with filter or
>> compressor) but no water that isn't tied up as ice crystals in

>Ummm, if there's no liquid water available to support life,

Now this is just the sort of thing a dorky humanities major would
foul-up. Oops.

After years of watching Captain Kirk traipse around dead worlds
without so much as a filter mask, after watching Luke moan about
his lot in life on that desert world he grew up on, well... I
guess I just got taken in.

Never mind about technological inconsistencies. Never mind about
Fermi's Question. Let's just talk about some simple chemistry.
The majority of popular SF is literally drowning in these sort of
inconsistencies, and because the majority of the audience is
scantily educated in such matters, they get away with it time and
time again.

The problem is so pervasive that even our popular SF-RPGs have
succumbed. Traveller, arguably the most popular SF-RPG, uses in
its basic planetary profile system a classification scheme for
atmospheres which focuses primarily on density, not composition.
When they finally got around the handling atmospheric composition
in the World Builder's Handbook (this being produced by DGP, not
GDW), they came up with the following atmospheric taints:
disease, gas mix, high oxygen, low oxygen, pollutants, sulfur
compounds. That's it. Honest. That's the whole damn list. Well,
okay, I think "radiation" was mentioned on a separate chart, but
even including that, we're talking seven taints. Think about it.
This book was entitled "World Builder's Handbook". Atmosphere is
arguably the most important component of a world. "So like, Jim,
can we like breath on this world or what?" And this is what they
came up with. Okay, I'll stop ranting. No need for a
tranquilizer. Really, I'm okay. :-)

SJG goes into slightly more detail. For atmospheric composition
we've got: Reducing (Methane, CO2, and/or Hydrogen), Oxygen-
Nitrogen (with only the most vaguely established percentage
ranges), Polluted (pollen, ash, industrial pollutants, etc),
Exotic (hydrogen, methane, carbon oxides, nitrogen), Corrosive
(ammonia, chlorine, fluorine, high-oxygen, nitrides, sulfur
compounds, and water vapor). However, this detail is never really
fleshed out. What are the peculiarities of such atmospheric
compositions. Under what conditions are you likely to find them.
Do you really need life in order to sustain free-standing oxygen
in an atmosphere? Which gases are incompatible? In short, give me
a process to follow.

To give SJG the credit they deserve, they touch on a lot of these
issues, and they make a good attempt at formalizing it all with a
process, but I still get the feeling that if what we're looking
for is Hard-SF, detail-oriented, chemical mucky-mucking, we can
go even further (and yes, we can *always* go further).

I decided to take Bertil's advice and take a look at 2300AD. This
time, GDW provides us with a list of gasses along with their
molecular weights, but no means to determine the percentages of
dominance. Here's the list, by the way.

   Molecular Hydrogen (H2)      2.0
   Helium (He)                  4.0
   Methane (CH4)               16.0
   Ammonia (NH3)               17.0
   Water Vapor (H2O)           18.0
   Neon (Ne)                   20.2
   Molecular Nitrogen (N2)     28.0
   Carbon Monoxide (CO)        28.0
   Nitric Oxide (NO)           30.0
   Molecular Oxygen (O2)       32.0
   Hydrogen Sulfide (H2S)      34.1
   Argon (Ar)                  39.9
   Carbon Dioxide (CO2)        44.0
   Nitrous Oxide (N2O)         44.0
   Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2)      46.0
   Ozone (O3)                  48.0
   Sulfur Dioxide (SO2)        64.1
   Sulfur Trioxide (SO3)       80.1
   Krypton (Kr)                83.8
   Xenon (Xe)                 131.3

The basic idea is that you figure out your planetary diameter and
density, and from that you can figure out the minimum molecular
weight retained. Then you consult this little table, and you can
figure out which gasses have bled off into space. For Earth, I
guess, that would be Hydrogen and Helium.

2300AD does give rules for determining oxygen content, but they
are pretty much based on the world's hydrosphere. The presence or
absence of life never figures into the equation. Likewise, there
are no rules for determining the preponderance of other gasses.
Nor are there rules to determine what effects these other gasses
might have, if any.

Looking toward net publications with my last lingering strands of
hope, I found that even Ross Smith's _Planet Generation System_
which was posted over a year ago makes no attempt to determine
atmospheric gasses. Indeed, taking together the sum of these four
separate systems, there seems to be a strong argument issuing
forth that such details are unnecessary, even cumbersome.

I think, going back to my original question of Oct 26, that this
was at least part of the sort of question I was getting at. I
mean, in Soft-SF, not only do we see lots of violation of various
rules of chemistry as the setting plays a subservient role to the
story, but we also see a real disregard for the details of
setting in general. I don't mean "disregard" in a negative sense.
All I'm saying is that such details are viewed as trivial... as
entirely irrelevant and beneath consideration and perhaps even
a bit dangerous (after all, the less you say, the less there is
to foul up on).

Consider, Classic Traveller used a single digit to represent a
planet's atmosphere, and they got away with it for an awful long
time. I heard people on the TML (the Traveller Mailing List if
you need some help with this acronym) complain about all sorts of
things, but the issue of atmospheric composition wasn't a
memorable part of the discussion. My guess is that while many SF
gamers would like to think of themselves as enjoying "Hard-SF"
over "Soft-SF", most don't want to be concerned with such mundane
matters as a planet's atmosphere. Far more fun to just "wing it",
even if there are freeware programs to generate and record such
minutia.

I remember a long discussion we had on the TML back in February
of '93 regarding main world generation. I still have a copy of
the discussion, in fact, which is why I'm able to remember the
date. But the reason I bring it up is because Bruce Pihlamae said
something conspicuously noteworthy. He said, instead of looking
at mainworld generation or even at star system generation as a
frozen process, that is, as a process which you undertake without
any regard to the age of the star or the age of the planets, how
about instead looking at it as an evolutionary process.

For those of you who have generated characters in Traveller, you
probably know what I'm talking about. You don't just roll
attributes and pick skills as in many other games. You undertake
a career. You make choices in that career. And as you go through
this process, not only do you generate a character, but you also
generate the character's career history. How appropriate it is,
then, to transfer this concept over to star system generation.
Start with a cloud of dust breaking off from some stellar nursery
and take it through an iterative process. Time consuming if done
manually, but a computer could do it quickly and perhaps even
generate results which make more sense than the results from a
frozen process. Why, they'd have to make sense, because they
wouldn't be just random die rolls. They'd be part of a world's
geologic history, and the process would make sure they fit into
that history.

Well, as you can see, this whole issue of planetary generation
can get somewhat cloudy. Here I've managed to ramble on about
planetary atmosphere for God only knows how long, and yet there
are so many other factors to consider, and the difficult part is
that they're all interrelated. And so instead of scooting on
ahead into yet more mundane and possibly mind-boggling matters of
world generation, I'm going to return to a subset of my original
question of Oct 26. In short, do you as a gamer (either player or
gamemaster) prefer to deal with this stuff, or do you prefer to
just ignore it? And how you answer that question, I think, says a
bit about what sort of gamer you are. I personally can go either
way. I find most of my players don't give a rat's hindquarters,
however, and I really don't blame them. But your groups may be
different, and whichever the case, I'd like to hear about it.
