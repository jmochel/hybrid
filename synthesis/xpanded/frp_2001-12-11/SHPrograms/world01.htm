The circles represent the parts of the world which must be developed to accommodate the characters demands on the world. The longer and deeper the campaign goes, the more there is a requirement for information. The characters have a certain &quot;sphere of influence&quot;. The parts of the world touched by that sphere must be developed.

The FRP World grows and matures as the campaign grows and matures. The referee is able to directly see which areas of the world need more development based on the actions of the characters.
                                                                                                                            <li><font face="Verdana, Lucida Sans, Arial" size="-1">The players are an intimate part of the world creation process. The actions of the PCs affect the part of the world &quot;seen&quot; by the characters; so, the players help define the world by determining what needs more detail and what does not. For example, if the players are very concerned about clothing styles in the world, the referee is likely to spend more time in that area, but the referee might be able to get by with a minimal description or examination of artistic styles.
                                                                                                                              <li><font face="Verdana, Lucida Sans, Arial" size="-1">The referee does not devote &quot;wasted&quot; time in world development. Because the world is shaped based on the characters' sphere of influence, the referee knows that most of the details he creates will be useful to the players.

This is especially true when the referee is mixing and matching &quot;modules&quot; into his campaign. Since many of the details in the world are being created more or less ad hoc, some of the details may be inconsistent with each other.
                                                                                                                                    <li><font face="Verdana, Lucida Sans, Arial" size="-1">The referee takes a big risk of being caught &quot;off-guard&quot; if the players ask questions about details the referee did not anticipate or if the characters travel to some area of the world which has not been examined in advance by the referee.
                                                                                                                                      <li><font face="Verdana, Lucida Sans, Arial" size="-1">The relations between portions or the world can be artificial. For example, if the referee decides to use both portions of Krynn and Arkham in his campaign, the connections between the two areas may be contrived at best.

For example, if there is a religious faction that is the lynch-pin to a module you would like to run in your campaign in the future then you will want to drop hints that such an organization exists in earlier sessions. That way, it does not seem so incongruous when you introduce the sect later and does not beg the question &quot;Hey, if these guys are so influential how come we never heard of them before?&quot;

Parties always do unexpected things. If you have a particular theme you want preserved in the campaign, or if there are things which must occur from a plot continuity standpoint then you should have back up plans of how to get the party involved if they do something quite the opposite of what you expect.

In practice, it is useful to spend five minutes after each session asking the players about what they want to see more of and anything they have questions about from the session. I have also found it is very useful to give the players some handouts each session like maps, old documents, diagrams, etc. It helps them picture the campaign world more easily.
