<H1>The Grand List of Overused Science Fiction Clich&eacute;s</H1></CENTER>
<table border="1" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tr><td bgcolor="#fff8ef">
&nbsp;&nbsp; Those of us who have read or seen a lot of science fiction have seen certain story elements pop up over and over and over. Some of these elements were actually pretty good ideas, and when handled well make for a pretty entertaining story, but have become hackneyed from overuse by the unimaginative. Others came into being through the deliberate effort to avoid another clich&eacute;. Still other ideas were lame from the get-go, and should have been dismissed from the author's thinking.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Clich&eacute;s are not in themselves necessarily bad, but their overuse shows that the writer has forgotten what separates the strong tale from the hollow: "the human heart in conflict with itself," as Faulkner said. Where there is this conflict, the tale stands; where the conflict is absent, the tale falls flat, and in neither case does it matter how many ships get blown up.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; The sophisticated reader (one who reads more than just SF) will note that some of these clich&eacute;s are not found solely in SF, but in other genres as well, and of course the lampooning of cliches is a time-honored part of good comedy.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; <I><B>DISCLAIMER:</B>&nbsp; The use of masculine/feminine pronouns and assignment of gender roles is not intended to preclude a reversal of gender roles. It is, however, intended to offend those who think that the Y chromosome is the root of all evil. Nyah.</I>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; This list is no longer "new and improved".  The "improvements" were too much work to maintain.
</td></tr></table>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Symbols:</B>
<TABLE BORDER="1" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
<tr>
<TD><IMG SRC="gcheck.jpg"></TD>
<TD>The green check marks those items which are not so bad, but have been used so many times that it takes a really strong treatment to lift them out of the slush pile. They will not destroy an otherwise well-written story, and some of the classics employ these elements (and employ them well).</TD>
</TR>

<tr>
<TD><IMG SRC="ycheck.jpg"></TD>
<TD>The yellow check marks those items which were mildly interesting the first time around, but simply provoke a response along the lines of "been there, done that" on the re-runs. Only a truly bizarre twist on these ideas can give them new life.</TD>
</TR>

<tr>
<TD><IMG SRC="gcross.jpg"></TD>
<TD>The green cross marks those items which are baloney, but are tolerable for the sake of dramatic effect as long as the events of the story do not depend on them.</TD>
</TR>

<tr>
<TD><IMG SRC="ycross.jpg"></TD>
<TD>The yellow cross marks those items which are lame, and support the plot in some way, but can be saved if there is a supporting justification. For instance, having a robot bleed oil when it gets shot is pretty lame; having a hydraulically-powered robot leak hydraulic fluid when shot is creditable.</TD>
</TR>

<tr>
<TD><IMG SRC="rcross.jpg"></TD>
<TD>The red cross marks those items which flatly contradict the known laws of nature, introduce an irreconcilable contradiction, require the characters involved to have the IQ of a banana peel, or are abysmally stupid for some other reason.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD><IMG SRC="stlogo.jpg"></TD>
<TD>The Starfleet logo (found in the Best/Worst Examples column) marks those items for which Star Trek has been an offender.</TD>

<TD><IMG SRC="pig.jpg"></TD>
<TD>The piggy marks those items that are unconscionably sexist.</TD>
