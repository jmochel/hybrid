Unlike Flash, SVG filters can be created in the library as if they were symbols. They can them be applied to any object at any time in the SVG document. Advanced filters will most likely be created graphically using software like Illustrator. This lesson is merely an introduction to show the range of filter effects available in SVG.</p>	<p><font size="4">TASKS: </font></p>	<ol>		<li>Open &quot;<a href="three.html" target="Example">three.svg</a>&quot; and evaluate the code. Notice the new element &quot;<tt>&lt;filter&gt;</tt>&quot;. In &quot;three.svg&quot; we have two filters identified as &quot;<tt>dropshadow</tt>&quot; and &quot;<tt>Bumps</tt>&quot;. Everything between the<tt>&quot;&lt;filter&gt;</tt>&quot; and &quot;<tt>&lt;/filter&gt;</tt>&quot; tags will affect any object that has that filter applied to it.<br>		<br>		<li>Apply the &quot;<tt>dropshadow</tt>&quot; effect to the square. You will need to apply filters to an object in the &quot;<tt>style</tt>&quot; declaration for that objects group. For example<tt> &quot;&lt;g&gt;...&lt;/g&gt;&quot; </tt>could wrap the &quot;<tt>&lt;rect&gt;</tt>&quot; element to give it a drop shadow.<br>		<br>		<li>Apply a 50% opacity to the circle. Opacity is NOT a filter; rather, it is a basic attribute that can be applied to any SVG element. The range for opacity is 0 to 1; 1 being 100% (or solid) and 0 being 0% (or completely transparent). Thus, to create a 50% opacity, you must enter a value of &quot;.5&quot;. (If opacity is not specified, the plug-in will use the default of 1. In the prepared SVG file we have provided the opacity style declaration, with it set to a value of 1.)<br>		<br>		<li>Apply the &quot;<tt>Bumps</tt>&quot; effect to the star. You will need to follow the same method used to apply &quot;<tt>dropshadow</tt>&quot;.<br>		<br>		<li>Change the angle of the drop shadow. There are usually several simple filters within one &quot;<tt>&lt;filter&gt;</tt>&quot; element. They each make a change to either a previous filter or the &quot;<tt>SourceGraphic</tt>&quot; itself. Simple filters may take either none, one or two source input &quot;in&quot; values, perform some calculations, and then produce a new filtered effect which may be used further as another &quot;in&quot; for a different filter. (Please note: The order in which simple filters are applied is very important. In this example we need to find where the shadow graphic is created and change some values. This would be the &quot;<tt>offset</tt>&quot;.)<br>		<br>		<li>Alter the opacity of the circle. The opacity is in the circle element's style declarative. Try different values. Remember: 0 is clear and 1 is solid.<br>		<br>		<li>Alter the intensity of the crumple effect on the star. Have fun with this one. Since there are several filters that make up the &quot;<tt>Bumps</tt>&quot; filter, it's hard to say that one specific filter makes the bumps. So simply pick a filter and edit some of the numbers it is using. Save and check your results.<br>		<br>		<li>Combine all three effects on the circle. This is mostly cutting and pasting in the right place. It is best to start with the simplest effect: the opacity. In this example you MUST apply the drop shadow first. (Note: This is because each filter uses the &quot;<tt>SourceGraphic</tt>&quot;... so whatever happens to it has an effect on the filters... AND... the &quot;<tt>Bumps</tt>&quot; filter is actually a rectancular effect that is 'wrapped' to the element it is affecting. If you apply the &quot;<tt>dropshadow</tt>&quot; after the &quot;<tt>Bumps</tt>&quot; you will get a rectangular drop shadow.)	</ol>	<p>Note: Included in this lesson is a <a href="three_complete.html" target="Example">file</a> containing all the above listed tasks.
