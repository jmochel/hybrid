We will show motion along a path, tweening (including easing IN and OUT), and animation based on changing coordinates (This technique would be the best for applying outside control to an SVG animation, i.e., Javascript or ASP). This lesson includes three completed SVGs: &quot;<a href="animate1.html" target="Example">animate1.svg</a>&quot;, &quot;<a href="animate2.html" target="Example">animate2.svg</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="animate3.html" target="Example" title="Example">animate3.svg</a>&quot;. We will document what is happening in each SVG, and you can edit some of the control elements/variables.</p>	<p><font size="4">TASKS: </font></p>	<ol>		<li>Open &quot;animate.svg&quot; and evaluate the code. Notice the new &quot;<tt>element&lt;animateotion&gt;</tt>&quot; in the &quot;<tt>&lt;circle&gt;</tt>&quot; declarative. &quot;<tt>&lt;path&gt;</tt>&quot; is similar to a motion path in Flash; the numbers define the line the circle is animated along. &quot;1 ,150&quot; are the start &quot;<tt>x</tt>&quot; and &quot;<tt>y</tt>&quot; coordinates, and &quot;400,150&quot; are the end coordinates. The &quot;<tt>&lt;dur&gt;</tt>&quot; variable is the duration in seconds. &quot;<tt>&lt;repeatcount&gt;</tt>&quot; tells it to loop either a specific number of times or indefinately.<br>		<br>		<li>Speed up and slow down the animation with the &quot;<tt>&lt;dur&gt;</tt>&quot; element. Change the path the circle travels along by editing the start &quot;<tt>x,y</tt>&quot; and/or the end &quot;<tt>x,y</tt>&quot; in the &quot;<tt>&lt;path&gt;</tt>&quot; element.<br>		<br>		<li>Cut and paste the other shape elements so that the circle animates under the square and over the star. 4. Add animation to the &quot;<tt>&lt;rect&gt;</tt>&quot; element using the &quot;<tt>&lt;animateotion&gt;</tt>&quot; tag.<br>		<br>		<li>Open &quot;animate2.svg&quot; and evaluate the code. Notice the new element &quot;<tt>&lt;animate&gt;</tt>&quot; in the &quot;<tt>circle</tt>&quot; element. Here you see a specific property of the &quot;<tt>circle</tt>&quot; element has been called out. We will be animating/changing the &quot;x&quot; property of the circle. Notice the new element values. These are the new &quot;<tt>x</tt>&quot; positions for the circle's &quot;<tt>x</tt>&quot; property. The &quot;<tt>&lt;dur&gt;</tt>&quot; is set to 10 seconds. Notice the new element &quot;<tt>keyTimes</tt>&quot;. The values in &quot;<tt>keyTimes</tt>&quot; refer to the overall duration time. In this example we are telling the circle its &quot;x&quot; position will be at the value at the keyTime. (For example: At 0 seconds, the circle will be at 0 &quot;x&quot; position; at 10 seconds it will be at 400 X position. The final new element, &quot;<tt>calcMode</tt>&quot;, tells it HOW to get from one value to the next. &quot;<tt>calcMode=&quot;linear&quot;</tt>&quot; tells the plug-in to use a linear progression to interpolate the other values between the &quot;keyTimes&quot;.<br>		<br>		<li>Change the values and keyTimes numbers to alter the timing and movement along the path. You can add or remove from the total number of key or values but keys and values must have the same total number. For example, if you add a new x position to values, you must add a new keyTime value as well. KeyTime values should never exceed the &quot;<tt>&lt;dur&gt;</tt>&quot;, and values that are greater than the overall SVG width and height will not be seen.<br>		<br>		<li>To understand the &quot;<tt>calcMode</tt>&quot;, change it to &quot;<tt>discrete</tt>&quot; which should make the circle 'jump' from one x position to the next at the specified keyTimes.<br>		<br>		<li>Move the circle from the top of the page to the middle, pause for two seconds, and then continue moving to the bottom of the page. Hint: you will need to change the attribute that is being animated.<br>		<br>		<li>Open &quot;animate3.svg&quot; and evaluate the code. New elements include &quot;<tt>keySplines</tt>&quot; and a new type of calcmode, which, oddly enough, is called &quot;<tt>spline</tt>&quot;. &quot;spline&quot; acts like the easing option on a Flash &quot;tween&quot;. Here we only have three values and keyTimes. (Imagine these as tweened keyframes in Flash.) We are still animating the X position, but the interpolation of what the values are between keyframes is not linear, but rather a curve. You can examine this curve use a graphing calculator to graph the equation.<br>		<br>		<li> This should give you some idea of Easing. The second set of values in the &quot;<tt>keySplines</tt>&quot; are simply the mirror image of the first set of values. The combination of these two splines give us an animation that slows to a stop as it approaches its first destination x position = 210 and then slowly accelerates again as it continues off to the right.<br>		<br>		<li>Play around with the middle position of the animation. Make the circle stop directly on top of the star for that &quot;Texaco&quot; look.	</ol></body></HTML>
