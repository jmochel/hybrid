This Module will get you acquainted with opening, editing, saving and viewing SVG files, thus making you familiar with the SVG syntax. You will also be introduced to several SVG elements (circle, rect, and polygon) as well as several attributes of each element (fill, stroke, x and y position). Note about syntax: While SVG resembles HTML in its form and follows many of the same conventions, the SVG specification is not as forgiving as your average web browser is with HTML code. Your syntax must be complete, meaning for every tag there must be a close tag. Please also note that SVG is an XML grammar definition. XML is case sensitive, thus SVG is case sensitive. You cannot use uppercase for your tags, as the uppercase version may imply a different tag.</p>	<p><font size="4">TASKS: </font></p>	<ol>		<li>Open the three files in BBEdit (or any text editor) and evaluate the code.<br>		<br>		<li>In the &quot;circle.svg&quot; file, alter the coordinate information to move the circle. These are the &quot;<tt>cx</tt>&quot; and &quot;<tt>cy</tt>&quot; values (&quot;<tt>x</tt>&quot; is the horizontal position and &quot;<tt>y</tt>&quot; is the vertical position.) Assume that &quot;<tt>x=0 y=0</tt>&quot; represents the upper left corner. You will notice that in these example files the coordinates are set to HALF the total size of the svg document. This sets the objects in the center of the SVG document.<br>		<br>		<li>Alter radius variable to resize the circle. This is the &quot;r&quot; value (&quot;r&quot; represents, for obvious reasons, radius.). Quick geometry lesson: You will notice the radius is HALF the total size of the circle. To create a circle that is 100 pixels in DIAMETER set r= &quot;50&quot;.<br>		<br>		<li>In the &quot;star.svg&quot; file, alter coordinate information for the object. This file has a new element: the transform element. Since the star is a complex shape, it does not have a predefined element tag like circle or square. It has been constructed out of a series of lines using the polyline element. In the &quot;<tt>transform=&quot;translate(x,y)&quot;</tt>&quot; move the star object using the same rules for moving the circle.<br>		<br>		<li>Alter information for the object in &quot;star.svg.&quot; Resize the star object by changing the scale of it in the code: &quot;<tt>transform=&quot;scale(scale_value)&quot;</tt>&quot;. The value &quot;<tt>scale_value</tt>&quot; is a multiplier.<br>		<br>		<li>Create a new file and combine all three objects and align them horizontally across the page using the cx,cy and x,y and &quot;<tt>transform=&quot;translate(x,y)&quot;</tt>&quot;. Name the file &quot;three_objects.svg&quot;. Please note, you must always end your SVG filenames with the &quot;.svg&quot; suffix until XML browsers have the SVG parser information built-in.	</ol></body></HTML>
