In this example we explore the SVG format in more detail and show similarities between other vector graphics software (Flash 4) and the SVG format. We will attempt to show how SVG accomplishes similar events such as trasnforming an instance of a symbol in a library at the code level. This lesson will help you see blocks of code in SVG as Flash-type symbols, and hopefully lead to a deeper understanding of how Flash performs some of its tasks.</p>	<p><font size="4">Tasks: </font></p>	<ol>		<li>Open &quot;library.svg&quot; and evaluate the code. Notice the new element &quot;<tt>&lt;defs&gt;</tt>&quot;. &quot;<tt>&lt;defs&gt;</tt>&quot; are like elements in a Flash library. In &quot;library.svg&quot; we have one element identified as &quot;<tt>star</tt>&quot;.<br>		<br>		<li>Everything below the closing &quot;<tt>&lt;defs&gt;</tt>&quot; tag is equivalent to the &quot;&quot; in html or the stage of a Flash movie. Anything in this part of the SVG is what is seen when the file is loaded. In the body area of &quot;library.svg&quot; we have an element identified as &quot;<tt>star 1</tt>&quot;. This is different than the original &quot;<tt>star</tt>&quot; definition in that it is an INSTANCE of that original &quot;<tt>star</tt>&quot; definition.<br>		<br>		<li>Duplicate the group &quot;<tt>&lt; g id = &quot;star 1&quot;...&gt;</tt>&quot; up to and including its closing tag &quot;<tt>&lt;/g&gt;</tt>&quot;. <br>		<br>			<li>Rename this new element &quot;<tt>star 2</tt>&quot; and change its &quot;<tt>x</tt>&quot; position (horizontal position) so it appears to the right of the first star. Change its fill color to &quot;<tt>red</tt>&quot;. (You can also use the traditional web hex colors, such as &quot;<tt>#FF0000</tt>&quot;.)<br>		<br>			<li>Duplicate the group &quot;<tt>&lt; g id = &quot;star 1&quot;...&gt;</tt>&quot; up to and including its closing tag &quot;<tt>&lt;/g&gt;</tt>&quot;.<br>				<br>						<li>Rename this new element &quot;<tt>star 3</tt>&quot; and change its x position (horizontal position) so it appears to the right of the second star. Change its fill color to &quot;<tt>yellow</tt>&quot;.<br>		<br>			<li>Arrange so that the second star overlays the first star by changing the X coordinate of either &quot;<tt>star 2</tt>&quot; or &quot;<tt>star 1</tt>&quot;. (Imagine this as moving layers in a Flash movie. In SVG the first element read will be the first element placed on the screen. Moving a 'layer' above or below any other 'layer' means simply cutting and pasting its code into the correct order position in the SVG file.<br>		<br>		<li>Rearrange layers so that the first star overlays the second star.	</ol></body></HTML>
