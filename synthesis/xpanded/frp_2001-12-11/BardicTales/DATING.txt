Subject:	DATING
Okay- one of things I am weak at in GMing is maintaining accurate time
records.  Like what is the date, etc.

SO... I am going to establish some dates and then assign one person for each
run to manage time spent.  :-)

Is there anyone who wants to take on consolidating a time line of BT World
events

Some in Player Time:  THESE dates are NOT accurate!  They are my rough,
off -the-top-of-my-head guesses, do not be bound by them...  They are in no
particular order...

Dora, Sterling and Adrienne go to the Dwarven Kingdoms(3 years ago?)
Kay meets Dora (5 years ago?)
Oleanth's Death (4.5 years ago?)
Sterling leaves home(4 years ago?)
Kay leaves Monastery(6 years ago?)
Battle at Gazad-Lah, aka the Wizard-King Battle (9 months ago???)
Jaric Fire-Lords defeat (7 months ago?)
Kay defeating Nahakar and becoming WAR (3 years ago?)
Vartigan leaves on Journey of Manhood
The Battle for Heimdella(1.5 years ago?)
The Founding of Heimdella(2 years ago?)
The Freeing of the High King of Maera from Possession,umm, I mean his flu.
:-)
The Banishing of Kay from Maera (2 years ago?)
Kay's Acquisition of the Shield of Heimdell (4 years?)
The Death of Baal (fairly recently..)
The Ritual of the Heartstone(VERY RECENTLY- days....)
The Re-Discovery of the Linking Ward/Sigmund's  Re-Awakening (4 years?)
The Death of Dullo/The Siege of Taleth (2 years?)
The Death of Yu-Chi(3 years?)

Historical:
The Mage Purge (~400 years ago)
King Mark's Ride (450 yearsago?)
The Chaos War/Creation of Bi-Frost/Fall of Golden Empire (~1800 years ago)
The Death of Usul/Asmonar (~1801 years ago)
The Creation the Tyriontill Pattern (?)
The beginning of the Golden Empire/Tri-Partite Empire (? 3800 years ago?)
The start of the Human Epoch (?10,000 years ago?)
The death of the High Paladin Sir Mallard in the Wasted Lands (6 or 7 years
ago?)/The Battle of Thelaya



I remember when we started the game(Kay meets Dora, the GROUP [Wei_Lee,
Maeve, Raec, Kalarina, John Mendore, Kilsorana] is formed.).. it was about
455 A.M.(After Mark) in the Feudal reckoning, about 1630ish in the Dorian
reckoning (After the Founding of Marden), and something like 4800ish(since
the beginning of the God-king's Reign) in the Tharuden calendar, something
like  1300ish in the Dal-Kon Calendar(since the Diaspora), and 1500ish in
the Tolnian calendar(when the city-state of Strichna and Tolna became ruled
by an Emperor).  Now since then I have mad e some abortive attempts at
dating and have probably given contradictory numbers.  Part of this is an
attempt to clean that up and place us in time!
