MOONSINGERS

      Moonsingers are healer/diviners/changers dependent upon the three moons of 
   Ea for their power. Their power is focused through rituals augmented by 
   song or dance. The three seperate areas of power are each linked to the three 
   moons. 

                     HEALING        LITAHA
                     DIVINATION     YRTHA
                     CHANGING       YAMEN

      Moonsingers are distinguished by simple clothing, love of animals, and 
   a fear of Iron. They are usually (95%) female. Moonsingers are well respected 
   by the nomadic tribes of Ea.   
      Moonsingers gain experience points as druids but they are not required 
   memorize spells. 

   TALENTS

      All Moonsingers possess the talent of woodcalling. Doing so a 
      moonsinger can summon to him ( at a rate of 4"/rnd. ) any wooden object 
      that he can see provided that:  

      1. The object weighs less than 6 lbs. 
      2. The object has been made by, or given to, the Moonsinger. 
         Items that the moonsinger has bought do not count unless the singer 
         has owned them for 1 yr +. 
      3. The object is not in contact with any metal other than silver.

   RITUALS

      All moonsingers have a base chance to perform all rituals of:

         BC = WISDOM + 3% * Level 

      In addition there are modifiers for the phase of the moon linked to the 
      type of ritual: 

                     PHASE    MODIFIER

                     0        0  %
                     1/4      25 %
                     1/2      50 %
                     3/4      75 %
                     1.0      100%

      Each ritual has a difficulty factor which is added to the base chance 
      in order to determine the overall chance. 

      There are three areas of ritual:

      HEALING

         - PHYSICAL
         - MENTAL
         - SPIRITUAL

      DIVINATION

         - PAST    (READING)
         - PRESENT (VISION)
         - FUTURE  (PROJECTION)

      CHANGING

         - COMMUNICATION (SENDING)
         - SUMMONING
