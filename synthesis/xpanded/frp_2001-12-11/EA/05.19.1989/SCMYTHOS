			    SHAPE CHANGER MYTHOLOGY

	 IN THE EARLIEST TIMES, BEFORE MAN, THERE WERE THOSE WE CALL
	 THE KORGUL AMOSK.  THEIRS WERE ALL THE FORMS OF MAMMAL AND
	 THEIRS WERE ALL THE GREAT FORESTS OF THE WORLD.  AND IT WAS
	 TO THURVANUS, SON OF SILVENUS, THAT THEY GAVE THANKS FOR HE
	 WAS THEIR FATHER AS THE LADY OF THE WOODS WAS THEIR MOTHER.

	     THEN CAME RAWR THE RAT GOD AND TO SOME OF THE OLD RACE HE
	 SAID THAT THE BEAUTIFUL RAT FORM WAS THE ONLY FORM AND IN
	 DOING SO DREW THEM AWAY FROM SILVANUS AND THE EARTH.  THE RAT
	 FORM SPREAD UNTIL IT BECAME BEFORE THE EYES OF THURVANUS.

	     THURVANUS SOUGHT OUT RAWR AND DROVE HIM FROM THE
	 FOREST.  AND HE GATHERED BEFORE HIM THE RAT GOD'S FOLLOWERS.
	 SOME WERE REPENTANT, MANY STILL CLUNG TO THE RAT GOD AND HIS
	 FORM.	SUCH WAS THE MERCY OF THURVANUS THAT THOSE REPENTANT
	 WOULD NEVER AGAIN TAKE THE ANIMAL FORMS AS THEIR OWN.
	 DISMAYED, THEY LEFT THE GREAT FOREST TO MAKE THEIR LIVES IN
	 THE PLAINS.  THOSE WHO STOOD BY THE RAT GOD WERE RENT APART.
